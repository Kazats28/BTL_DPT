<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the cold gray dawn the sisters lit their lamp and read



<P>their chapter with an earnestness never felt before.&nbsp; For now



<P>the shadow of a real trouble had come, the little books were full



<P>of help and comfort, and as they dressed, they agreed to say goodbye



<P>cheerfully and hopefully, and send their mother on her anxious



<P>journey unsaddened by tears or complaints from them.&nbsp; Everything



<P>seemed very strange when they went down, so dim and still outside,



<P>so full of light and bustle within.&nbsp; Breakfast at that early hour



<P>seemed odd, and even Hannah's familiar face looked unnatural as she



<P>flew about her kitchen with her nightcap on.&nbsp; The big trunk stood



<P>ready in the hall, Mother's cloak and bonnet lay on the sofa, and



<P>Mother herself sat trying to eat, but looking so pale and worn



<P>with sleeplessness and anxiety that the girls found it very hard



<P>to keep their resolution.&nbsp; Meg's eyes kept filling in spite of



<P>herself, Jo was obliged to hide her face in the kitchen roller



<P>more than once, ant the little girls wore a grave, troubled



<P>expression, as if sorrow was a new experience to them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nobody talked much, but as the time drew very near and they



<P>sat waiting for the carriage, Mrs. March said to the girls, who



<P>were all busied about her, one folding her shawl, another smoothing



<P>out the strings of her bonnet, a third putting on her overshoes,



<P>and a forth fastening up her travelling bag...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Children, I leave you to Hannah's care and Mr. Laurence's



<P>protection.&nbsp; Hannah is faithfulness itself, and our good neighbor



<P>will guard you as if you were his own.&nbsp; I have no fears for you,



<P>yet I am anxious that you should take this trouble rightly.&nbsp; Don't



<P>grieve and fret when I am gone, or think that you can be idle and



<P>comfort yourselves by being idle and trying to forget.&nbsp; Go on with



<P>your work as usual, for work is a blessed solace.&nbsp; Hope and keep

busy,



<P>and whatever happens, remember that you never can be fatherless."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, Mother."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Meg, dear, be prudent, watch over your sisters, consult



<P>Hannah, and in any perplexity, go to Mr. Laurence.&nbsp; Be patient,

Jo,



<P>don't get despondent or do rash things, write to me often, and be



<P>my brave girl, ready to help and cheer all.&nbsp; Beth, comfort yourself



<P>with your music, and be faithful to the little home duties, and You



<P>Amy, help all you can, be obedient, and keep happy safe at home."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We will, Mother!&nbsp; We will!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and



<P>listen.&nbsp; That was the hard minute, but the girls stood it well.&nbsp;

No



<P>one cried, no one ran away or uttered a lamentation, though their



<P>hearts were very heavy as they sent loving messages to Father,



<P>remembering, as they spoke that it might be too late to deliver them.



<P>They kissed their mother quietly, clung about her tenderly, and



<P>tried to wave their hands cheerfully when she drove away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie and his grandfather came over to see her off, and Mr.



<P>Brooke looked so strong and sensible and kind that the girls



<P>christened him `Mr. Greatheart' on the spot.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Goodby, my darlings!&nbsp; God bless and keep us all!" whispered



<P>Mrs. March, as she kissed one dear little face after the other,



<P>and hurried into the carriage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As she rolled away, the sun came out, and looking back, she



<P>saw it shining on the group at the gate like a good omen.&nbsp; They



<P>saw it also, and smiled and waved their hands, and the last thing



<P>she beheld as she turned the corner was the four bright faces, and



<P>behind them like a bodyguard, old Mr. Laurence, faithful Hannah,



<P>and devoted Laurie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How kind everyone is to us!" she said, turning to find fresh



<P>proof of it in the respectful sympathy of the young man's face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't see how they can help it," returned Mr. Brooke,



<P>laughing so infectiously that Mrs. March could not help smiling.



<P>And so the journey began with the good omens of sunshine, smiles,



<P>and cheerful words.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I feel as if there had been an earthquake," said Jo, as their



<P>neighbors went home to breakfast, leaving them to rest and refresh



<P>themselves.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It seems as if half the house was gone," added Meg forlornly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Beth opened her lips to say something, but could only point to



<P>the pile of nicely mended hose which lay on Mother's table, showing



<P>that even in her last hurried moments she had thought and worked



<P>for them.&nbsp; It was a little thing, but it went straight to their



<P>hearts, and in spite of their brave resolutions, they all broke



<P>down and cried bitterly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Hannah wisely allowed them to relieve their feelings, and



<P>when the shower showed signs of clearing up, she came to the



<P>rescue, armed with a coffeepot.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now, ny dear young ladies, remember what your ma said, and



<P>don't fret.&nbsp; Come and have a cup of coffee all round, and then



<P>let's fall to work and be a credit to the family."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Coffee was a treat, and Hannah showed great tact in making it



<P>that morning.&nbsp; No one could resist her persuasive nods, or the



<P>fragrant invitation issuing from the nose of the coffee pot.&nbsp; They



<P>drew up to the table, exchanged their handkerchiefs for napkins,



<P>and in ten minutes were all right again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"`Hope and keep busy', that's the motto for us, so let's see



<P>who will remember it best.&nbsp; I shall go to Aunt March, as usual.



<P>Oh, won't she lecture though!" said Jo, as she sipped with



<P>returning spirit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall go to my Kings, though I'd much rather stay at home



<P>and attend to things here," said Meg, wishing she hadn't made her



<P>eyes so red.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No need of that.&nbsp; Beth and I can keep house perfectly well,"



<P>put in Amy, with an important air.



<P>"Hannah will tell us what to do, and we'll have everything



<P>nice when you come home," added Beth, getting out her mop and dish



<P>tub without delay.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think anxiety is very interesting," observed Amy, eating



<P>sugar pensively.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The girls couldn't help laughing, and felt better for it,



<P>though Meg shook her head at the young lady who could find



<P>consolation in a sugar bowl.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The sight of the turnovers made Jo sober again, and when the



<P>two went out to their daily tasks, they looked sorrowfully back



<P>at the window where they were accustomed to see their mother's



<P>face.&nbsp; It was gone, but Beth had remembered the little household



<P>ceremony, and there she was, nodding away at them like a



<P>rosyfaced mandarin.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's so like my Beth!" said Jo, waving her hat, with a



<P>grateful face.&nbsp; "Goodbye, Meggy, I hope the Kings won't strain



<P>today.&nbsp; Don't fret about Father, dear," she added, as they parted.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And I hope Aunt March won't croak.&nbsp; Your hair is becoming,



<P>and it looks very boyish and nice," returned Meg, trying not to



<P>smile at the curly head, which looked comically small on her tall



<P>sister's shoulders.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's my only comfort." And, touching her hat a` la Laurie,



<P>away went Jo, feeling like a shorn sheep on a wintry day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>News from their father comforted the girls very much, for



<P>though dangerously ill, the presence of the best and tenderest of



<P>nurses had already done him good.&nbsp; Mr. Brooke sent a bulletin every



<P>day, and as the head of the family, Meg insisted on reading the



<P>dispatches, which grew more cheerful as the week passed.&nbsp; At first,



<P>everyone was eager to write, and plump envelopes were carefully



<P>poked into the letter box by one or other of the sisters, who felt



<P>rather important with their Washington correspondence.&nbsp; As one

of



<P>these packets contained characteristic notes from the party, we will



<P>rob an imaginary mail, and read them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>My dearest Mother:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It is impossible to tell you how happy your last letter made



<P>us, for the news was so good we couldn't help laughing and crying



<P>over it.&nbsp; How very kind Mr. Brooke is, and how fortunate that Mr.



<P>Laurence's business detains him near you so long, since he is so



<P>useful to you and Father.&nbsp; The girls are all as good as gold.&nbsp;

Jo



<P>helps me with the sewing, and insists on doing all sorts of hard



<P>jobs.&nbsp; I should be afraid she might overdo, if I didn't know her



<P>`moral fit' wouldn't last long.&nbsp; Beth is as regular about her tasks



<P>as a clock, and never forgets what you told her.&nbsp; She grieves about



<P>Father, and looks sober except when she is at her little piano.&nbsp;

Amy



<P>minds me nicely, and I take great care of her.&nbsp; She does her own



<P>hair, and I am teaching her to make buttonholes and mend her stockings.



<P>She tries very hard, and I know you will be pleased with her



<P>improvement when you come.&nbsp; Mr. Laurence watches over us like a



<P>motherly old hen, as Jo says, and Laurie is very kind and neighborly.



<P>He and Jo keep us merry, for we get pretty blue sometimes, and feel



<P>like orphans, with you so far away.&nbsp; Hannah is a perfect saint.&nbsp;

She



<P>does not scold at all, and always calls me Miss Margaret, which is



<P>quite proper, you know, and treats me with respect.&nbsp; We are all



<P>well and busy, but we long, day and night, to have you back.&nbsp; Give



<P>my dearest love to Father, and believe me, ever your own...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>MEG

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This note, prettily written on scented paper, was a great



<P>contrast to the next, which was scribbled on a big sheet of thin



<P>foreign paper, ornamented with blots and all manner of flourishes



<P>and curly-tailed letters.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>My precious Marmee:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Three cheers for dear Father!&nbsp; Brooke was a trump to telegraph



<P>right off, and let us know the minute he was better.&nbsp; I rushed

up



<P>garret when the letter came, and tried to thank god for being so



<P>good to us, but I could only cry, and say, "I'm glad!&nbsp; I'm glad!"



<P>Didn't that do as well as a regular prayer?&nbsp; For I felt a great



<P>many in my heart.&nbsp; We have such funny times, and now I can enjoy



<P>them, for everyone is so desperately good, it's like living in a



<P>nest of turtledoves.&nbsp; You'd laugh to see Meg head the table and



<P>try to be motherish.&nbsp; She gets prettier every day, and I'm in love



<P>with her sometimes.&nbsp; The children are regular archangels, and I--



<P>well, I'm Jo, and never shall be anything else.&nbsp; Oh, I must tell



<P>you that I came near having a quarrel with Laurie.&nbsp; I freed my

mind



<P>about a silly little thing, and he was offended.&nbsp; I was right,

but



<P>didn't speak as I ought, and he marched home, saying he wouldn't



<P>come again till I begged pardon.&nbsp; I declared I wouldn't and got

mad.



<P>It lasted all day.&nbsp; I felt bad and wanted you very much.&nbsp;

Laurie and



<P>I are both so proud, it's hard to beg pardon.&nbsp; But I thought he'd



<P>come to it, for I was in the right.&nbsp; He didn't come, and just at



<P>night I remembered what you said when Amy fell into the river.&nbsp;

I



<P>read my little book, felt better, resolved not to let the sun set



<P>on my anger, and ran over to tell Laurie I was sorry.&nbsp; I met him



<P>at the gate, coming for the same thing.&nbsp; We both laughed, begged



<P>each other's pardon, and felt all good and comfortable again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I made a `pome' yesterday, when I was helping Hannah wash,



<P>and as Father likes my silly little things, I put it in to amuse



<P>him.&nbsp; Give him my lovingest hug that ever was, and kiss yourself



<P>a dozen times for your...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>TOPSY-TURVY JO

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A SONG FROM THE SUDS

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Queen of my tub, I merrily sing,



<P>While the white foam rises high,



<P>And sturdily wash and rinse and wring,



<P>And fasten the clothes to dry.



<P>Then out in the free fresh air they swing,



<P>Under the sunny sky.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I wish we could wash from out hearts and souls



<P>The stains of the week away,



<P>And let water and air by their magic make



<P>Ourselves as pure as they.



<P>Then on the earth there would be indeed,



<P>A glorious washing day!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Along the path of a useful life,



<P>Will heartsease ever bloom.



<P>The busy mind has no time to think



<P>Of sorrow or care or gloom.



<P>And anxious thoughts may be swept away,



<P>As we bravely wield a broom.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I am glad a task to me is given,



<P>To labor at day by day,



<P>For it brings me health and strength and hope,



<P>And I cheerfully learn to say,



<P>"Head, you may think, Heart, you may feel,



<P>But, Hand, you shall work alway!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Dear Mother,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There is only room for me to send my love, and some pressed



<P>pansies from the root I have been keeping safe in the house for



<P>Father to see.&nbsp; I read every morning, try to be good all day, and



<P>sing myself to sleep with Father's tune.&nbsp; I can't sing `LAND OF



<P>THE LEAL' now, it makes me cry.&nbsp; Everyone is very kind, and we

are



<P>as happy as we can be without you.&nbsp; Amy wants the rest of the page,



<P>so I must stop.&nbsp; I didn't forget to cover the holders, and I wind



<P>the clock and air the rooms every day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Kiss dear Father on the cheek he calls mine.&nbsp; Oh, do come soon



<P>to your loving .&nbsp; ..

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>LITTLE BETH

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Ma Chere Mamma,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>We are all well I do my lessons always and never corroberate



<P>the girls--Meg says I mean contradick so I put in both words and



<P>you can take the properest.&nbsp; Meg is a great comfort to me and lets



<P>me have jelly every night at tea its so good for me Jo says because



<P>it keeps me sweet tempered.&nbsp; Laurie is not as respeckful as he

ought



<P>to be now I am almost in my teens, he calls me Chick and hurts my



<P>feelings by talking French to me very fast when I say Merci or Bon



<P>jour as Hattie King does.&nbsp; The sleeves of my blue dress were all



<P>worn out, and Meg put in new ones, but the full front came wrong



<P>and they are more blue than the dress.&nbsp; I felt bad but did not

fret



<P>I bear my troubles well but I do wish Hannah would put more starch



<P>in my aprons and have buckwheats every day.&nbsp; Can't she?&nbsp; Didn't

I



<P>make that interrigation point nice?&nbsp; Meg says my punchtuation and



<P>spelling are disgraceful and I am mortyfied but dear me I have so



<P>many things to do, I can't stop.&nbsp; Adieu, I send heaps of love to



<P>Papa.&nbsp; Your affectionate daughter .&nbsp; ..

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<B>CHAPTER TWO</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning.



<P>No stockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she



<P>felt as much disappointed as she did long ago, when her little



<P>sock fell down because it was crammed so full of goodies.&nbsp; Then



<P>she remembered her mother's promise and, slipping her hand under



<P>her pillow, drew out a little crimson-covered book.&nbsp; She knew



<P>it very well, for it was that beautiful old story of the best



<P>life ever lived, and Jo felt that it was a true guidebook for



<P>any pilgrim going on a long journey.&nbsp; She woke Meg with a "Merry



<P>Christmas," and bade her see what was under her pillow.&nbsp; A green-



<P>covered book appeared, with the same picture inside, and a few



<P>words written by their mother, which made their one present very



<P>precious in their eyes.&nbsp; Presently Beth and Amy woke to rummage



<P>and find their little books also, one dove-colored, the other



<P>blue, and all sat looking at and talking about them, while the



<P>east grew rosy with the coming day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In spite of her small vanities, Margaret had a sweet and



<P>pious nature, which unconsciously influenced her sisters,



<P>especially Jo, who loved her very tenderly, and obeyed her



<P>because her advice was so gently given.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Girls," said Meg seriously, looking from the tumbled head



<P>beside her to the two little night-capped ones in the room beyond,



<P>"Mother wants us to read and love and mind these books, and we



<P>must begin at once.&nbsp; We used to be faithful about it, but since



<P>Father went away and all this war trouble unsettled us, we have



<P>neglected many things.&nbsp; You can do as you please, but I shall keep



<P>my book on the table here and read a little every morning as soon



<P>as I wake, for I know it will do me good and help me through the day."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then she opened her new book and began to read.&nbsp; Jo put her



<P>arm round her and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the



<P>quiet expression so seldom seen on her restless face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How good Meg is!&nbsp; Come, Amy, let's do as they do.&nbsp; I'll



<P>help you with the hard words, and they'' explain things if we



<P>don't understand," whispered Beth, very much impressed by the



<P>pretty books and her sisters, example.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm glad mine is blue," said Amy.&nbsp; and then the rooms were



<P>very still while the pages were softly turned, and the winter



<P>sunshine crept in to touch the bright heads and serious faces



<P>with a Christmas greeting.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Where is Mother?" asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to



<P>thank her for their gifts, half an hour later.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Goodness only knows.&nbsp; some poor creeter came a-beggin', and



<P>your ma went straight off to see what was needed.&nbsp; There never

was



<P>such a woman for givin' away vittles and drink, clothes and firin',"



<P>replied Hannah, who had lived with the family since Meg was born,



<P>and was considered by them all more as a friend than a servant.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She will be back soon, I think, so fry your cakes, and have



<P>everything ready," said Meg, looking over the presents which were



<P>collected in a basket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced



<P>at the proper time.&nbsp; "why, where is Amy's bottle of cologne?"



<P>she added, as the little flask did not appear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She took it out a minute ago, and went off with it to put a



<P>ribbon on it, or some such notion," replied Jo, dancing about the



<P>room to take the first stiffness off the new army slippers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How nice my handkerchiefs look, don't they?&nbsp; Hannah washed



<P>and ironed them for me, and I marked them all myself," said Beth,



<P>looking proudly at the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her



<P>such labor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Bless the child!&nbsp; She's gone and put `Mother' on them instead



<P>of `M.&nbsp; March'.&nbsp; How funny!" cried Jo, taking one up.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Isn't that right?&nbsp; I thought it was better to do it so,



<P>because Meg's initials are M.M., and I don't want anyone to use



<P>these but Marmee," said Beth;, looking troubled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's all right, dear, and a very pretty idea, quite sensible



<P>too, for no one can ever mistake now.&nbsp; It will please her very

much,



<P>I know," said Meg, with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There's Mother.&nbsp; Hide the basket, quick!" cried Jo, as a door



<P>slammed and steps sounded in the hall.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy came in hastily, and looked rather abashed when she saw



<P>her sisters all waiting for her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Where have you been, and what are you hiding behind you?"



<P>asked Meg, surprised to see, by her hood and cloak, that lazy Amy



<P>had been out so early.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't laugh at me, Jo!&nbsp; I didn't mean anyone should know till



<P>the time came.&nbsp; I only meant to change the little bottle for a

big



<P>one, and I gave all my money to get it, and I'm truly trying not



<P>to be selfish any more."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As she spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced



<P>the cheap one, and looked so earnest and humble in her little



<P>effort to forget herself that Meg hugged her on the spot, and Jo



<P>pronounced her `a trump', while Beth ran to the window, and picked



<P>her finest rose to ornament the stately bottle.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You see I felt ashamed of my present, after reading and talking



<P>about being good this morning, so I ran round the corner and changed



<P>it the minute I was up, and I'm so glad, for mine is the handsomest



<P>now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Another bang of the street door sent the basket under the sofa,



<P>and the girls to the table, eager for breakfast.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Merry Christmas, Marmee!&nbsp; Many of them!&nbsp; Thank you for our



<P>books.&nbsp; We read some, and mean to every day," they all cried in



<P>chorus.



<P>"Merry Christmas, little daughters!&nbsp; I'm glad you began at



<P>once, and hope you will keep on.&nbsp; But I want to say one word



<P>before we sit down.&nbsp; Not far away from here lies a poor woman



<P>with a little newborn baby.&nbsp; Six children are huddled into one

bed



<P>to keep from freezing, for they have no fire.&nbsp; There is nothing

to



<P>eat over there, and the oldest boy came to tell me they were



<P>suffering hunger and cold.&nbsp; My girls, will you give them your



<P>breakfast as a Christmas present?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour,



<P>and for a minute no one spoke, only a minute, for Jo exclaimed



<P>impetuously, "I'm so glad you came before we began!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?"



<P>asked Beth eagerly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall take the cream and the muffings," added Amy, heroically



<P>giving up the article she most liked.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg was already covering the buckwheats, and piling the bread



<P>into one big plate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I thought you'd do it," said Mrs. March, smiling as if satisfied.



<P>"You shall all go and help me, and when we come back we will have bread



<P>and milk for breakfast, and make it up at dinnertime."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They were soon ready, and the procession set out.&nbsp; Fortunately



<P>it was early, and they went through back streets, so few people saw



<P>them, and no one laughed at the queer party.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A poor, bare, miserable room it was, with broken windows, no



<P>fire, ragged bedclothes, a sick mother, wailing baby, and a group



<P>of pale, hungry children cuddled under one old quilt, trying to



<P>keep warm.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>How the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls



<P>went in.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ach, mein Gott!&nbsp; It is good angels come to us!" said the poor



<P>woman, crying for joy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Funny angels in hoods and mittens," said Jo, and set them to



<P>laughing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been



<P>at work there.&nbsp; Hannah, who had carried wood, made a fire, and



<P>stopped up the broken panes with old hats and her own cloak.&nbsp; Mrs.



<P>March gave the mother tea and gruel, and comforted her with promises



<P>of help, while she dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had



<P>been her own.&nbsp; The girls meantime spread the table, set the children



<P>round the fire, and fed them like so many hungry birds, laughing,



<P>talking, and trying to understand the funny broken English.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Das ist gut!"&nbsp; "Die Engel-kinder!" cried the poor things as



<P>they ate and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze.



<P>The girls had never been called angel children before, and



<P>thought it very agreeable, especially Jo, who had been considered



<P>a `Sancho' ever since she was born.&nbsp; That was a very happy breakfast,



<P>though they didn't get any of it.&nbsp; And when they went away,



<P>leaving comfort behind, I think there were not in all the city



<P>four merrier people than the hungry little girls who gave away



<P>their breakfasts and contented themselves with bread and milk



<P>on Christmas morning.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's loving our neighbor better than ourselves, and I



<P>like it," said Meg, as they set out their presents while their



<P>mother was upstairs collecting clothes for the poor Hummels.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Not a very splendid show, but there was a great deal of



<P>love done up in the few little bundles, and the tall vase of



<P>red roses, white chrysanthemums, and trailing vines, which



<P>stood in the middle, gave quite an elegant air to the table.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She's coming!&nbsp; Strike up, Beth!&nbsp; Open the door, Amy!&nbsp;

Three



<P>cheers for Marmee!" cried Jo, prancing about while Meg went to



<P>conduct Mother to the seat of honor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Beth played her gayest march, amy threw open the door, and



<P>Meg enacted escort with great dignity.&nbsp; Mrs. March was both



<P>surprised and touched, and smiled with her eyes full as she



<P>examined her presents and read the little notes which accompanied



<P>them.&nbsp; The slippers went on at once, a new handkerchief was slipped



<P>into her pocket, well scented with Amy's cologne, the rose was



<P>fastened in her bosom, and the nice gloves were pronounced a perfect



<P>fit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining,



<P>in the simple, loving fashion which makes these home festivals so



<P>pleasant at the time, so sweet to remember long afterward, and



<P>then all fell to work.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that



<P>the rest of the day was devoted to preparations for the evening



<P>festivities.&nbsp; Being still too young to go often to the theater,



<P>and not rich enough to afford any great outlay for private



<P>performances, the girls put their wits to work, and necessity being



<P>the mother of invention, made whatever they needed.&nbsp; Very clever



<P>were some of their productions, pasteboard guitars, antique lamps



<P>made of old-fashioned butter boats covered with silver paper,



<P>gorgeous robes of old cotton, glittering with tin spangles from



<P>a pickle factory, and armor covered with the same useful diamond



<P>shaped bits left inn sheets when the lids of preserve pots were



<P>cut out.&nbsp; The big chamber was the scene of many innocent revels.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>No gentleman were admitted, so Jo played male parts to her



<P>heart's content and took immense satisfaction in a pair of russet



<P>leather boots given her by a friend, who knew a lady who knew an



<P>actor.&nbsp; These boots, an old foil, and a slashed doublet once used



<P>by an artist for some picture, were Jo's chief treasures and



<P>appeared on all occasions.&nbsp; The smallness of the company made it



<P>necessary for the two principal actors to take several parts



<P>apiece, and they certainly deserved some credit for the hard work



<P>they did in learning three or four different parts, whisking in



<P>and out of various costumes, and managing the stage besides.&nbsp; It



<P>was excellent drill for their memories, a harmless amusement, and



<P>employed many hours which otherwise would have been idle, lonely,



<P>or spent in less profitable society.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On christmas night, a dozen girls piled onto the bed which



<P>was the dress circle, and sat before the blue and yellow chintz



<P>curtains in a most flattering state of expectancy.&nbsp; There was a



<P>good deal of rustling and whispering behind the curtain, a trifle



<P>of lamp smoke, and an occasional giggle from Amy, who was apt to



<P>get hysterical in the excitement of the moment.&nbsp; Presently a bell



<P>sounded, the curtains flew apart, and the OPERATIC TRAGEDY began.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A gloomy wood," according to the one playbill, was represented



<P>by a few shrubs in pots, green baize on the floor, and a



<P>cave in the distance.&nbsp; This cave was made with a clothes horse



<P>for a roof, bureaus for walls, and in it was a small furnace in



<P>full blast, with a black pot on it and an old witch bending over



<P>it.&nbsp; The stage was dark and the glow of the furnace had a fine



<P>effect, especially as real steam issued from the kettle when the



<P>witch took off the cover.&nbsp; A moment was allowed for the first



<P>thrill to subside, then Hugo, the villain, stalked in with a



<P>clanking sword at his side, a slouching hat, black beard,



<P>mysterious cloak, and the boots.&nbsp; After pacing to and fro in much



<P>agitation, he struck his forehead, and burst out in a wild



<P>strain, singing of his hatred to Roderigo, his love for Zara,



<P>and his pleasing resolution to kill the one and win the other.



<P>The gruff tones of Hugo's voice, with an occasional shout when



<P>his feelings overcame him, were very impressive, and the audience



<P>applauded the moment he paused for breath.&nbsp; bowing with the air



<P>of one accustomed to public praise, he stole to the cavern and



<P>ordered Hagar to come forth with a commanding, "What ho, minion!



<P>I need thee!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Out came Meg, with gray horsehair hanging about her face,



<P>a red and black robe, a staff, and cabalistic signs upon her



<P>cloak.&nbsp; Hugo demanded a potion to make Zara adore him, and one



<P>destroy Roderigo.&nbsp; Hagar, in a fine dramatic melody, promised



<P>both, and proceeded to call up the spirit who would bring the



<P>love philter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Hither, hither, from thy home,



<P>Airy sprite, I bid thee come!



<P>Born of roses, fed on dew,



<P>Charms and potions canst thou brew?



<P>Bring me here, with elfin speed,



<P>The fragrant philter which I need.



<P>Make it sweet and swift and strong,



<P>Spirit, answer now my song!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A soft strain of music sounded, and then at the back of the



<P>cave appeared a little figure in cloudy white, with glittering



<P>wings, golden hair, and a garland of roses on its head.&nbsp; Waving



<P>a wand, it sang...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Hither I come,



<P>From my airy home,



<P>Afar in the silver moon.



<P>Take the magic spell,



<P>And use it well,



<P>Or its power will vanish soon!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And dropping a small, gilded bottle at the witch's feet, the



<P>spirit vanished.&nbsp; Another chant from Hagar produced another apparition,



<P>not a lovely one, for with a bang an ugly black imp appeared and,



<P>having croaked a reply, tossed a dark bottle at Hugo and disappeared



<P>with a mocking laugh.&nbsp; Having warbled his thanks and put the potions



<P>in his boots, Hugo departed, and Hagar informed the audience that



<P>as he had killed a few of her friends in times past, she had cursed



<P>him, and intends to thwart his plans, and be revenged on him.&nbsp;

Then



<P>the curtain fell, and the audience reposed and ate candy while



<P>discussing the merits of the play.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A good deal of hammering went on before the curtain rose again,



<P>but when it became evident what a masterpiece of stage carpentery



<P>had been got up, no one murmured at the delay.&nbsp; It was truly superb.



<P>A tower rose to the ceiling, halfway up appeared a window with a



<P>lamp burning in it, and behind the white curtain appeared Zara in



<P>a lovely blue and silver dress, waiting for Roderigo.&nbsp; He came

in



<P>gorgeous array, with plumed cap, red cloak, chestnut lovelocks, a



<P>guitar, and the boots, of course.&nbsp; Kneeling at the foot of the

tower,



<P>he sang a serenade in melting tones.&nbsp; Zara replied and, after a



<P>musical dialogue, consented to fly.&nbsp; Then came the grand effect

of



<P>the play.&nbsp; Roderigo produced a rope ladder, with five steps to

it,



<P>threw up one end, and invited Zara to descend.&nbsp; Timidly she crept



<P>from her lattice, put her hand on Roderigo's shoulder, and was



<P>about to leap gracfully down when "Alas!&nbsp; Alas for Zara!" she



<P>forgot her train.&nbsp; It caught in the window, the tower tottered,



<P>leaned forward, fell with a crash, and buried the unhappy lovers



<P>in the ruins.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A universal shriek arose as the russet boots waved wildly



<P>from the wreck and a golden head emerged, exclaiming, "I told you



<P>so!&nbsp; I told you so!"&nbsp; With wonderful presence of mind, Don

Pedro,



<P>the cruel sire, rushed in, dragged out his daughter, with a hasty



<P>aside...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't laugh!&nbsp; Act as if it was all right!" and, ordering



<P>Roderigo up, banished him form the kingdom with wrath and scorn.



<P>Though decidedly shaken by the fall from the tower upon him,



<P>Roderigo defied the old gentleman and refused to stir.&nbsp; This



<P>dauntless example fired Zara.&nbsp; She also defied her sire, and he



<P>ordered them both to the deepest dungeons of the castle.&nbsp; A stout



<P>little retainer came in with chains and led them away, looking very



<P>much frightened and evidently forgetting the speech he ought to



<P>have made.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Act third was the castle hall, and here Hagar appeared, having



<P>come to free the lovers and finish Hugo.&nbsp; She hears him coming

and



<P>hides, sees him put the potions into two cups of wine and bid the



<P>the timid little servant, "Bear them to the captives in their cells,



<P>and tell them I shall come anon."&nbsp; The servant takes Hugo aside

to



<P>tell him something, and Hagar changes the cups for two others which



<P>are harmless.&nbsp; Ferdinando, the `minion', carries them away, and



<P>Hagar puts back the cup which holds the poison meant for Roderigo.



<P>Hugo, getting thirsty after a long warble, drinks it, loses his wits,



<P>and after a good deal of clutching and stamping, falls flat and dies,



<P>while Hagar informs him what she has done in a song of exquisite



<P>power and melody.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was a truly thrilling scene, though some persons might



<P>have thought that the sudden tumbling down of a quantity of long red



<P>hair rather marred the effect of the villain's death.&nbsp; He was called



<P>before the curtain, and with great propriety appeared, leading Hagar,



<P>whose singing was considered more wonderful than all the rest of the



<P>performance put together.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Act fourth displayed the despairing Roderigo on the point of



<P>stabbing himself because he has been told that Zara has deserted him.



<P>Just as the dagger is at his heart, a lovely song is sung under his



<P>window, informing him that Zara is true but in danger, and he can



<P>save her if he will.&nbsp; A key is thrown in, which unlocks the door,



<P>and in a spasm of rapture he tears off his chains and rushes away



<P>to find and rescue his lady love.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Act fifth opened with a stormy scene between Zara and Don Pedro.



<P>He wishes her to go into a convent, but she won't hear of it, and



<P>after a touching appeal, is about to faint when Roderigo dashes in



<P>and demands her hand.&nbsp; Don Pedro refuses, because he is not rich.



<P>They shout and gesticulate tremendously but cannot agree, and



<P>Rodrigo is about to bear away the exhausted Zara, when the timid



<P>servant enters with a letter and a bag from Hagar, who has mysteriously



<P>disappeared.&nbsp; The latter informs the party that she bequeths



<P>untold wealth to the young pair and an awful doom to Don Pedro, if



<P>he doesn't make them happy.&nbsp; The bag is opened, and several quarts

of



<P>tin money shower down upon the stage till it is quite glorified with



<P>the glitter.&nbsp; This entirely softens the stern sire.&nbsp; He consents



<P>without a murmur, all join in a joyful chorus, and the curtain falls



<P>upon the lovers kneeling to receive Don Pedro's blessing in attitudes



<P>of the most romantic grace.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Tumultuous applause followed but received an unexpected check,



<P>for the cot bed, on which the dress circle was built, suddenly shut



<P>up and extinguished the enthusiastic audience.&nbsp; Roderigo and Don



<P>Pedro flew to the rescue, and all were taken out unhurt, though many



<P>were speechless with laughter.&nbsp; the excitement had hardly subsided



<P>when Hannah appeared, with "Mrs. March's compliments, and would the



<P>ladies walk down to supper."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was a surprise even to the actors, and when they saw the



<P>table, they looked at one another in rapturous amazement.&nbsp; It was



<P>like Marmee to get up a little treat for them, but anything so fine



<P>as this was unheard of since the departed days of plenty.&nbsp; There

was



<P>ice cream, actually two dishes of it, pink and white, and cake and



<P>fruit and distracting french bonbons and, in the middle of the



<P>table, four great bouquets of hot house flowers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It quite took their breath away, and they stared first at the



<P>table and then at their mother, who looked as if she enjoyed it



<P>immensely.



<P>"Is it fairies?" asked Amy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Santa Claus," said Beth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mother did it." And Meg smiled her sweetest, in spite of her



<P>gray beard and white eyebrows.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Aunt March had a good fit and sent the supper," cried Jo, with



<P>a sudden inspiration.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"All wrong.&nbsp; Old Mr. Laurence sent it," replied Mrs. March.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The Laurence boy's grandfather! What in the world put such a



<P>thing into his head?&nbsp; We don't know him!' exclaimed Meg.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hannah told one of his servants about your breakfast party.



<P>He is an odd old gentleman, but that pleased him.&nbsp; He knew my father



<P>years ago, and he sent me a polite note this afternoon, saying he



<P>hoped I would allow him to express his friendly feeling toward my



<P>children by sending them a few trifles in honor of the day.&nbsp; I



<P>could not refuse, and so you have a little feast at night to make



<P>up for the bread-and-milk breakfast."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That boy; put it into his head, I know he did!&nbsp; He's a capital



<P>fellow, and I wish we could get acquainted.&nbsp; He looks as if he'd



<P>like to know us but he's bashful, and Meg is so prim she won't let



<P>me speak to him when we pass," said Jo, as the plates went round,



<P>and the ice began to melt out of sight, with ohs and ahs of satisfaction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You mean the people who live in the big house next door, don't



<P>you?" asked one of the girls.&nbsp; "My mother knows old Mr. Laurence,



<P>but says he's very proud and doesn't like to mix with his neighbors.



<P>He keeps his grandson shut up, when he isn't riding or walking with



<P>his tutor, and makes him study very hard.&nbsp; We invited him to our



<P>party, but he didn't come.&nbsp; Mother says he's very nice, though

he



<P>never speaks to us girls."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Our cat ran away once, and he brought her back, and we



<P>talked over the fence, and were getting on capitally, all about



<P>cricket, and so on, when he saw Meg coming, and walked off.&nbsp; I



<P>mean to know him some day, for he needs fun, I'm sure he does,"



<P>said Jo decidedly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I like his manners, and he looks like a little gentleman, so



<P>I've no objection to your knowing him, if a proper opportunity comes.



<P>He brought the flowers himself, and I should have asked him in, if



<P>I had been sure what was going on upstairs.&nbsp; He looked so wistful



<P>as he went away, hearing the frolic and evidently having none of



<P>his own."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's a mercy you didn't , Mother!" laughed Jo, looking at



<P>her boots.&nbsp; "But we'll have another play sometime that he can



<P>see.&nbsp; Perhaps he'll help act.&nbsp; Wouldn't that be jolly?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I never had such a fine bouquet before!&nbsp; How pretty it is!"



<P>And Meg examined her flowers with great interest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They are lovely.&nbsp; But Beth's roses are sweeter to me," said



<P>Mrs. March, smelling the half-dead posy in her belt.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Beth nestled up to her, and whispered softly, "I wish I



<P>could send my bunch to Father.&nbsp; I'm afraid he isn't having such



<P>a merry Christmas as we are."

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>"Jo!&nbsp; Jo!&nbsp; Where are you?" cried Meg at the foot of the garret

stairs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here!" answered a husky voice from above, and, running up,



<P>Meg found her sister eating apples and crying over the Heir of



<P>Redclyffe, wrapped up in a comforter on an old three-legged sofa



<P>by the sunny window.&nbsp; This was Jo's favorite refuge, and here she



<P>loved to retire with half a dozen russets and a nice book, to enjoy



<P>the quiet and the society of a pet rat who lived near by and didn't



<P>mind her a particle.&nbsp; As Meg appeared, Scrabble whisked into his



<P>hole.&nbsp; Jo shook the tears off her cheeks and waited to hear the

news.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Such fun!&nbsp; Only see!&nbsp; A regular note of invitation from Mrs.



<P>Gardiner for tomorrow night!" cried Meg, waving the precious paper



<P>and then proceeding to read it with girlish delight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"`Mrs. Gardiner would be happy to see Miss March and Miss Josephine



<P>at a little dance on New Year's Eve.' Marmee is willing we should go,



<P>now what shall we wear?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What's the use of asking that, when you know we shall wear



<P>our poplins, because we haven't got anything else?" answered Jo



<P>with her mouth full.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If I only had a silk!" sighed Meg.&nbsp; "Mother says I may when



<P>I'm eighteen perhaps, but two years is an everlasting time to wait."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm sure our pops look like silk, and they are nice enough for



<P>us.&nbsp; Yours is as good as new, but I forgot the burn and the tear

in



<P>mine.&nbsp; Whatever shall I do?&nbsp; The burn shows badly, and I can't

take



<P>any out."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You must sit still all you can and keep your back out of sight.



<P>The front is all right.&nbsp; I shall have a new ribbon for my hair,

and



<P>Marmee will lend me her little pearl pin, and my new slippers are



<P>lovely, and my gloves will do, though they aren't as nice as I'd like."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mine are spoiled with lemonade, and I can't get any new ones,



<P>so I shall have to go without," said Jo, who never troubled herself



<P>much about dress.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You must have gloves, or I won't go," cried Meg decidedly.



<P>"Gloves are more important than anything else.&nbsp; You can't dance



<P>without them, and if you don't I should be so mortified."



<P>"Then I'll stay still.&nbsp; I don't care much for company dancing.



<P>It's no fun to go sailing round.&nbsp; I like to fly about and cut capers."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You can't ask Mother for new ones, they are so expensive, and



<P>you are so careless.&nbsp; She said when you spoiled the others that

she



<P>shouldn't get you any more this winter.&nbsp; Can't you make them do?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I can hold them crumpled up in my hand, so no one will know



<P>how stained they are.&nbsp; That's all I can do.&nbsp; No!&nbsp; I'll

tell you how



<P>we can manage, each wear one good one and carry a bad one.&nbsp; Don't



<P>you see?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your hands are bigger than mine, and you will stretch my glove



<P>dreadfully," began Meg, whose gloves were a tender point with her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then I'll go without.&nbsp; I don't care what people say!" cried Jo,



<P>taking up her book.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You may have it, you may!&nbsp; Only don't stain it, and do behave



<P>nicely.&nbsp; Don't put your hands behind you, or stare, or say `Christopher



<P>Columbus!' will you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't worry about me.&nbsp; I'll be as prim ad I can and not get



<P>into any scrapes, if I can help it.&nbsp; Now go and answer your note,



<P>and let me finish this splendid story."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So Meg went away to `accept with thanks', look over her dress,



<P>and sing blithely as she did up her one real lace frill, while Jo



<P>finished her story, her four apples, and had a game of romps with



<P>Scrabble.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On New Year's Eve the parlor was deserted, for the two younger



<P>girls played dressing maids and the two elder were absorbed in the



<P>all-important business of `getting ready for the party'.&nbsp; Simple



<P>as the toilets were, there was a great deal of running up and down,



<P>laughing and talking, and at one time a strong smell of burned hair



<P>pervaded the house.&nbsp; Meg wanted a few curls about her face, and

Jo



<P>undertook to pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ought they to smoke like that?" asked Beth from her perch



<P>on the bed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's the dampness drying," replied Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What a queer smell!&nbsp; It's like burned feathers," observed Amy,



<P>smoothing her own pretty curls with a superior air.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There, now I'll take off the papers and you'll see a cloud



<P>of little ringlets," said Jo, putting down the tongs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She did take off the papers, but no cloud of ringlets appeared,



<P>for the hair came with the papers, and the horrified hairdresser



<P>laid a row of little scorched bundles on the bureau before her victim.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, oh, oh! What have you done?&nbsp; I'm spoiled!&nbsp; I can't go!&nbsp;

My



<P>hair, oh, my hair!" wailed Meg, looking with despair at the uneven



<P>frizzle on her forehead.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Just my luck!&nbsp; You shouldn't have asked me to do it.&nbsp; I always



<P>spoil everything.&nbsp; I'm so sorry, but the tongs were too hot, and

so



<P>I've made a mess," groaned poor Jo, regarding the little black



<P>pancakes with tears of regret.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It isn't spoiled.&nbsp; Just frizzle it, and tie your ribbon so



<P>the ends come on your forehead a bit, and it will look like the



<P>last fashion.&nbsp; I've seen many girls do it so," said Amy consolingly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Serves me right for trying to be fine.&nbsp; I wish I'd let my hair



<P>alone," cried Meg petulantly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So do I, it was so smooth and pretty.&nbsp; But it will soon grow



<P>out again," said Beth, coming to kiss and comfort the shorn sheep.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After various lesser mishaps, Meg was finished at last, and



<P>by the united exertions of the entire family Jo's hair was got up



<P>and her dress on.&nbsp; They looked very well in their simple suits,



<P>Meg's in silvery drab, with a blue velvet snood, lace frills, and



<P>the pearl pin.&nbsp; Jo in maroon, with a stiff, gentlemanly linen



<P>collar, and a white chrysanthemum or two for her only ornament.



<P>Each put on one nice light glove, and carried one soiled one, and



<P>all pronounced the effect "quite easy and fine".&nbsp; Meg's high-heeled



<P>slippers were very tight and hurt her, though she would not own it,



<P>and Jo's nineteen hairpins all seemed stuck straight into her head,



<P>which was not exactly comfortable, but, dear me, let us be elegant



<P>or die.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Have a good time, dearies!" said Mrs. March, as the sisters



<P>went daintily down the walk.&nbsp; "Don't eat much supper, and come



<P>away at eleven when I send Hannah for you."&nbsp; As the gate clashed



<P>behind them, a voice cried from a window...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Girls, girls!&nbsp; Have you you both got nice pocket handkerchiefs?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, yes, spandy nice, and Meg has cologne on hers," cried Jo,



<P>adding with a laugh as they went on, "I do believe Marmee would ask



<P>that if we were all running away from an earthquake.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is one of her aristocratic tastes, and quite proper, for a



<P>real lady is always known by neat boots, gloves, and handkerchief,"



<P>replied Meg, who had a good many little `aristocratic tastes' of



<P>her own.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now don't forget to keep the bad breadth out of sight, Jo.



<P>Is my sash right?&nbsp; And does my hair look very bad?" said Meg, as



<P>she turned from the glass in Mrs. Gardiner's dressing room after



<P>a prolonged prink.



<P>"I know I shall forget.&nbsp; If you see me doing anything wrong,



<P>just remind me by a wink, will you?" returned Jo, giving her



<P>collar a twitch and her head a hasty brush.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, winking isn't ladylike.&nbsp; I'll lift my eyebrows if any



<P>thing is wrong, and nod if you are all right.&nbsp; Now hold your



<P>shoulder straight, and take short steps, and don't shake hands if



<P>you are introduced to anyone.&nbsp; It isn't the thing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How do you learn all the proper ways?&nbsp; I never can.&nbsp; Isn't



<P>that music gay?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Down they went, feeling a trifle timid, for they seldom went



<P>to parties, and informal as this little gathering was, it was an



<P>event to them.&nbsp; Mrs. Gardiner, a stately old lady, greeted them



<P>kindly and handed them over to the eldest of her six daughters.



<P>Meg knew Sallie and was at her ease very soon, but Jo, who didn't



<P>care much for girls or girlish gossip, stood about, with her back



<P>carefully against the wall, and felt as much out of place as a



<P>colt in a flower garden.&nbsp; Half a dozen jovial lads were talking



<P>about skates in another part of the room, and she longed to go



<P>and join them, for skating was one of the joys of her life.&nbsp; She



<P>telegraphed her wish to Meg, but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly



<P>that she dared not stir.&nbsp; No one came to talk to her, and one by



<P>one the group dwindled away till she was left alone.&nbsp; She could



<P>not roam about and amuse herself, for the burned breadth would



<P>show, so she stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing



<P>began.&nbsp; Meg was asked at once, and the tight slippers tripped



<P>about so briskly that none would have guessed the pain their



<P>wearer suffered smilingly.&nbsp; Jo saw a big red headed youth



<P>approaching her corner, and fearing he meant to engage her, she



<P>slipped into a curtained recess, intending to peep and enjoy



<P>herself in peace.&nbsp; Unfortunately, another bashful person had



<P>chosen the same refuge, for, as the curtain fell behind her,



<P>she found herself face to face with the `Laurence boy'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dear me, I didn't know anyone was here!" stammered Jo,



<P>preparing to back out as speedily as she had bounced in.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But the boy laughed and said pleasantly, though he looked



<P>a little startled, "Don't mind me, stay if you like."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Shan't I disturb you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not a bit.&nbsp; I only came here because I don't know many



<P>people and felt rather strange at first, you know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So did I.&nbsp; Don't go away, please, unless you'd rather."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The boy sat down again and looked at his pumps, till Jo



<P>said, trying to be polite and easy, "I think I've had the pleasure



<P>of seeing you before.&nbsp; You live near us, don't you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Next door."&nbsp; And he looked up and laughed outright, for Jo's



<P>prim manner was rather funny when he remembered how they had chatted



<P>about cricket when he brought the cat home.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That put Jo at her ease and she laughed too, as she said, in



<P>her heartiest way, "We did have such a good time over your nice



<P>Christmas present."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Grandpa sent it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But you put it into his head, didn't you, now?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How is your cat, Miss March?" asked the boy, trying to look



<P>sober while his black eyes shone with fun.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nicely, thank you, Mr. Laurence.&nbsp; But I am not Miss March, I'm



<P>only Jo," returned the young lady.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm not Mr. Laurence, I'm only Laurie."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Laurie Laurence, what an odd name."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My first name is theodore, but I don't like it, for the



<P>fellows called me Dora, so I made the say Laurie instead."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hate my name, too, so sentimental!&nbsp; I wish every one would



<P>say Jo instead of Josephine.&nbsp; How did you make the boys stop calling



<P>you Dora?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I thrashed `em."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I can't thrash Aunt March, so I suppose I shall have to bear



<P>it."&nbsp; And Jo resigned herself with a sigh.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't you like to dance, Miss Jo?" asked Laurie, looking



<P>as if he thought the name suited her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I like it well enough if there is plenty of room, and everyone



<P>is lively.&nbsp; In a place like this I'm sure to upset something,



<P>tread on people's toes, or do something dreadful, so I keep out



<P>of mischief and let Meg sail about.&nbsp; Don't you dance?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sometimes.&nbsp; You see I've been abroad a good many years, and



<P>haven't been into company enough yet to know how you do things here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Abroad!." cried Jo.&nbsp; "Oh, tell me about it!&nbsp; I love dearly

to



<P>hear people describe their travels."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie didn't seem to know where to begin, but Jo's eager



<P>questions soon set him going, and he told her how he had been at



<P>school in Vevay, where the boys never wore hats and had a fleet of



<P>boats on the lake, and for holiday fun went on walking trips about



<P>Switzerland with their teachers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't I wish I'd been there!" cried Jo.&nbsp; "Did you go to Paris?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We spent last winter there."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Can you talk French?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We were not allowed to speak anything else at Vevay."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do say some!&nbsp; I can read it, but can't pronounce."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Quel nom a cetter jeune demoiselle en les pantoulles jolis?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How nicely you do it!&nbsp; Let me see...you said, `Who is the



<P>young lady in the pretty slippers', didn't you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oui, mademoiselle."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's my sister Margaret, and you knew it was!&nbsp; Do you think



<P>she is pretty?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, she makes me think of the German girls, she looks so



<P>fresh and quiet, and dances like a lady."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo quite glowed with pleasure at this boyish praise of her



<P>sister, and stored it up to repeat to Meg.&nbsp; Both peeped and



<P>critisized and chatted till they felt like old acquaintances.&nbsp;

Laurie's



<P>bashfulness soon wore off, for Jo's gentlemanly demeanor amused and



<P>set him at his ease, and Jo was her merry self again, because her



<P>dress was forgotten and nobody lifted their eyebrows at her.&nbsp; She



<P>liked the `Laurence boy' better than ever and took several good



<P>looks at him, so that she might describe him to the girls, for they



<P>had no brothers, very few male cousins, and boys were almost unknown



<P>creatures to them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Curly black hair, brown skin, big black eyes, handsome nose,



<P>fine teeth, small hands and feet, taller than I am, very polite,



<P>for a boy, and altogether jolly.&nbsp; Wonder how old he is?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was on the tip of Jo's tongue to ask, but she checked



<P>herself in time and, with unusual tact, tried to find out in a



<P>round-about way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I suppose you are going to college soon?&nbsp; I see you pegging



<P>away at your books, no, I mean studying hard."&nbsp; And Jo blushed



<P>at the dreadful `pegging' which had escaped her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie smiled but didn't seem shocked, and answered with a



<P>shrug.&nbsp; "Not for a year or two.&nbsp; I won't go before seventeen,



<P>anyway."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Aren't you but fifteen?" asked Jo, looking at the tall lad,



<P>whom she had imagined seventeen already.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sixteen, next month."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How I wish I was going to college!&nbsp; You don't look as if



<P>you liked it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hate it!&nbsp; Nothing but grinding or skylarking.&nbsp; And I don't



<P>like the way fellows do either, in this country."



<P>"What do you like?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To live in Italy, and to enjoy myself in my own way."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo wanted very much to ask what his own way was, but his



<P>black brows looked rather threatening as he knit them, so she



<P>changed the subject by saying, as her foot kept time, "That's a



<P>splendid polka!&nbsp; Why don't you go and try it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If you will come too," he answered, with a gallant little bow.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I can't, for I told meg I wouldn't, because..." There Jo



<P>stopped, and looked undecided whether to tell or to laugh.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Because, what?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You won't tell?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Never!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I have a bad trick of standing before the fire, and so



<P>I burn my frocks, and I scorched this one, and though it's nicely



<P>mended, it shows, and Meg told me to keep still so no one would



<P>see it.&nbsp; You may laugh, if you want to.&nbsp; It is funny, I know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Laurie didn't laugh.&nbsp; He only looked dawn a minute, and



<P>the expression of his face puzzled Jo when he said very gently,



<P>"Never mind that.&nbsp; I'll tell you how we can manage.&nbsp; There's

a long



<P>hall out there, and we can dance grandly, and no one will see us.



<P>Please come."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo thanked him and gladly went, wishing she had two neat gloves



<P>when she saw the nice, pearl-colored ones her partner wore.&nbsp; The



<P>hall was empty, and they had a grand polka, for Laurie danced well,



<P>and taught her the German step, which delighted Jo, being full of



<P>swing and spring.&nbsp; When the music stopped, they sat down on the



<P>stairs to get their breath, and Laurie was in the midst of an account



<P>of a students' festival at Heidelberg when Meg appeared in search of



<P>her sister.&nbsp; She beckoned, and Jo reluctantly followed her into

a



<P>side room, where she found her on a sofa, holding her foot, and



<P>looking pale.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I've sprained my ankle.&nbsp; That stupid high heel turned and



<P>gave me a sad wrench.&nbsp; It aches so, I can hardly stand, and I don't



<P>know how I'm ever going to get home," she said, rocking to and fro



<P>in pain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I knew you'd hurt your feet with those silly shoes.&nbsp; I'm



<P>sorry.&nbsp; But I don't see what you can do, except get a carriage,

or



<P>stay here all night," answered Jo, softly rubbing the poor ankle as



<P>she spoke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I can't have a carriage without its costing ever so much.&nbsp; I



<P>dare say I can't get one at all, for most people come in their own,



<P>and it's a long way to the stable, and no one to send."



<P>"I'll go."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, indeed!&nbsp; It's past nine, and dark as Egypt.&nbsp; I can't

stop



<P>here, for the house is full.&nbsp; Sallie has some girls staying with

her.



<P>I'll rest till Hannah comes, and then do the best I can."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll ask Laurie.&nbsp; He will go," said Jo," looking relieved as



<P>the idea occurred to her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mercy, no!&nbsp; Don't ask or tell anyone.&nbsp; Get me my rubbers,

and



<P>put these slippers with our things.&nbsp; I can't dance anymore, but

as



<P>soon as supper is over, watch for Hannah and tell me the minute she



<P>comes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They are going out to supper now.&nbsp; I'll stay with you.&nbsp; I'd



<P>rather."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, dear, run along, and bring me some coffee.&nbsp; I'm so tired



<P>I can't stir."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So Meg reclined, with rubbers well hidden, and Jo went blundering



<P>away to the dining room, which she found after going into a



<P>china closet, and opening the door of a room where old Mr. Gardiner



<P>was taking a little private refreshment.&nbsp; Making a dart at the



<P>table, she secured the coffee, which she immediately spilled,



<P>thereby making the front of her dress as bad as the back.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, dear, what a blunderbuss I am!" exclaimed Jo, finishing



<P>Meg's glove by scrubbing her gown with it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Can I help you?" said a friendly voice.&nbsp; And there was Laurie,



<P>with a full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was trying to get something for Meg, who is very tired, and



<P>someone shook me, and here I am in a nice state," answered Jo,



<P>glancing dismally from the stained skirt to the coffee-colored glove.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Too bad!&nbsp;&nbsp; I was looking for someone to give this to.&nbsp;

May I



<P>take it to your sister?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, thank you!&nbsp; I'll show you where she is.&nbsp; I don't offer

to



<P>take it myself, for I should only get into another scrape if I did."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo led the way, and as if used to waiting on ladies, Laurie



<P>drew up a little table, brought a second installment of coffee and



<P>ice for Jo, and was so obliging that even particular Meg pronounced



<P>him a `nice boy'.&nbsp; They had a merry time over the bonbons and mottoes,



<P>and were in the midst of a quiet game of BUZZ, with two or three



<P>other young people who had strayed in, when Hannah appeared.&nbsp; Meg



<P>forgot her foot and rose so quickly that she was forced to catch



<P>hold of Jo, with an exclamation of pain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hush!&nbsp; Don't say anything," she whispered, adding aloud, "It's



<P>nothing.&nbsp; I turned my foot a little, that's all," and limped upstairs



<P>to put her things on.



<P>Hannah scolded, Meg cried, and Jo was at her wits' end, till



<P>se decided to take things into her own hands.&nbsp; Slipping out, she

ran



<P>down and, finding a servant, asked if he could get her a carriage.



<P>It happened to be a hired waiter who knew nothing about the



<P>neighborhood and Jo was looking round for help when Laurie, who had



<P>heard what she said, came up and offered his grandfather's carriage,



<P>which had just come for him, he said.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's so early!&nbsp; You can't mean to go yet?" began Jo.&nbsp; looking



<P>relieved but hesitating to accept the offer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I always go early, I do, truly!&nbsp; Please let me take you home.



<P>It's all on my way, you know, and it rains, they say."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That settled it, and telling him of Meg's mishap, Jo gratefully



<P>accepted and rushed up to bring down the rest of the party.&nbsp; Hannah



<P>hated rain as much as a cat does so she made no trouble, and they



<P>rolled away in the luxurious close carriage, feeling very festive



<P>and elegant.&nbsp; Laurie went on the box so Meg could keep her foot

up,



<P>and the girls talked over their party in freedom.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I had a capital time.&nbsp; Did you?' asked Jo, rumpling up her



<P>hair, and making herself comfortable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, till I hurt myself.&nbsp; Sallie's friend, Annie Moffat, took



<P>a fancy to me, and asked me to come and spend a week with her when



<P>Sallie does.&nbsp; She is going in the spring when the opera comes,

and



<P>it will be perfectly splendid, if Mother only lets me go," answered



<P>Meg, cheering up at the thought.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I saw you dancing with the red headed man I ran away from.&nbsp; Was



<P>he nice?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh.&nbsp; very!&nbsp; His hair is auburn, not red, and he was very

polite,



<P>and I had a delicious redowa with him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He looked like a grasshopper in a fit when he did the new step.



<P>Laurie and I couldn't help laughing.&nbsp; Did you hear us?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, but it was very rude.&nbsp; What were you about all that time,



<P>hidden away there?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo told her adventures, and by the time she had finished they



<P>were at home.&nbsp; With many thanks, they said good night and crept

in,



<P>hoping to disturb no one, but the instant their door creaked, two



<P>little nightcaps bobbed up, and two sleepy but eager voices cried out...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Tell about the party!&nbsp; Tell about the party!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With what Meg called `a great want of manners' Jo had saved some



<P>bonbons for the little girls, and they soon subsided, after hearing



<P>the most thrilling events of the evening.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I declare, it really seems like being a fine young lady, to



<P>come home from the party in a carriage and sit in my dressing gown



<P>wit a maid to wait on me," said Meg, as Jo bound up her foot with



<P>arnica and brushed her hair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't believe fine young ladies enjoy themselves a bit more



<P>than we do, in spite of our burned hair, old gowns, one glove apiece



<P>and tight slippers that sprain our ankles when we are silly enough



<P>to wear them," And I think Jo was quite right.

<B>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For a week the amount of virtue in the old house would have



<P>supplied the neighborhood.&nbsp; It was really amazing, for everyone



<P>seemed in a heavenly frame of mind, and self-denial was all the



<P>fashion.&nbsp; Relieved of their first anxiety about their father,



<P>girls insensibly relaxed their praiseworthy efforts a little,



<P>and began to fall back into old ways.&nbsp; They did not forget



<P>their motto, but hoping and keeping busy seemed to grow easier,



<P>and after such tremendous exertions, they felt that Endeavor



<P>deserved a holiday, and gave it a good many.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo caught a bad cold through neglect to cover the shorn



<P>head enough, and was ordered to stay at home till she was better,



<P>for Aunt March didn't like to hear people read with colds in



<P>their heads.&nbsp; Jo liked this, and after an energetic rummage from



<P>garret to cellar, subsided on the sofa to nurse her cold with



<P>arsenicum and books.&nbsp; Amy found that housework and art did not



<P>go well together, and returned to her mud pies.&nbsp; Meg went daily



<P>to her pupils, and sewed, or thought she did, at home, but much



<P>time was spent in writing long letters to her mother, or reading



<P>the Washington dispatches over and over.&nbsp; Beth kept on, with only



<P>slight relapses into idleness or grieving.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>All the little duties were faithfully done each day, and



<P>many of her sisters' also, for they were forgetful, and the house



<P>seemed like a clock whose pendulum was gone a-visiting.&nbsp; When her



<P>heart got heavy with longings for Mother or fears for Father, she



<P>went away into a certain closet, hid her face in the folds of a



<P>dear old gown, and made her little moan and prayed her little



<P>prayer quietly by herself.&nbsp; Nobody knew what cheered her up after



<P>a sober fit, but everyone felt how sweet and helpful Beth was, and



<P>fell into a way of going to her for comfort or advice in their



<P>small affairs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>All were unconscious that this experience was a test of



<P>character, and when the first excitement was over, felt that they



<P>had done well and deserved praise.&nbsp; So they did, but their



<P>mistake was in ceasing to do well, and they learned this lesson



<P>through much anxiety and regret.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Meg, I wish you'd go and see the Hummels.&nbsp; You know Mother



<P>told us not to forget them." said Beth, ten days after Mrs. March's



<P>departure.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm too tired to go this afternoon," re;lied Meg, rocking



<P>comfortably as she sewed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Can't you, Jo?' asked Beth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Too stormy for me with my cold."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I thought it was almost well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's well enough for me to go out with Laurie, but not well



<P>enough to go to the Hummels'," said Jo, laughing, but looking a



<P>little ashamed of her inconsistency.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why don't you go yourself?" asked Meg.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have been every day, but the baby is sick, and I don't



<P>know what to do for it.&nbsp; Mrs. Hummel goes away to work, and



<P>Lottchen takes care of it.&nbsp; But it gets sicker and sicker,



<P>and I think you or Hannah ought to go."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Beth spoke earnestly, and Meg promised she would go tomorrow.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ask Hannah for some nice little mess, and take it round, Beth,



<P>the air will do you good," said Jo, adding apologetically, "I'd go



<P>but I want to finish my writing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My head aches and I'm tired, so I thought maybe some of you



<P>would go," said Beth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Amy will be in presently, and she will run down for us,



<P>suggested Meg.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So Beth lay down on the sofa, the others returned to their work,



<P>and the Hummels were forgotten.&nbsp; An hour passed.&nbsp; Amy did

not come,



<P>Meg went to her room to try on a new dress, Jo was absorbed in her



<P>story, and Hannah was sound asleep before the kitchen fire, when



<P>Beth quietly put on her hood, filled her basket with odds and ends



<P>for the poor children, and went out into the chilly air with a heavy



<P>head and a grieved look in her patient eyes.&nbsp; It was late when

she



<P>came back, and no one saw her creep upstairs and shut herself into



<P>her mother's room.&nbsp; Half an hour after, Jo went to `Mother's closet'



<P>for something, and there found little Beth sitting on the medicine



<P>chest, looking very grave, with red eyes and a camphor bottle in



<P>her hand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Christopher Columbus!&nbsp; What's the matter?" cried Jo, as Beth



<P>put out her hand as if to warn her off, and asked quickly, "You've



<P>had the scarlet fever, havent't you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Years ago, when Meg did.&nbsp; Why?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then I'll tell you.&nbsp; Oh, Jo, the baby's dead!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What baby?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mrs. Hummel's.&nbsp; It died in my lap before she got home," cried



<P>Beth with a sob.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My poor dear, how dreadful for you!&nbsp; I ought to have gone,"



<P>said Jo, taking her sister in her arms as she sat down in her



<P>mother's bit chair, with a remorseful face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It wasn't dreadful, Jo, only so sad!&nbsp; I saw in a minute it



<P>was sicker, but Lottchen said her mother had gone for a doctor, so



<P>I took Baby and let Lotty rest.&nbsp; It seemed asleep, but all of a



<P>sudden if gave a little cry and trembled, and then lay very still.



<P>I tried to warm its feet, and Lotty gave it some milk, but it didn't



<P>stir, and I knew it was dead."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't cry, dear!&nbsp; What did you do?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I just sat and held it softly till Mrs. Hummel came with the



<P>doctor.&nbsp; He said it was dead, and looked at Heinrich and Minna,

who



<P>have sore throats.&nbsp; `Scarlet fever, ma'am.&nbsp; Ought to have

called me



<P>before, ' he said crossly.&nbsp; Mrs. Hummel told him she was poor,

and



<P>had tried to cure baby herself, but now it was too late, and she



<P>could only ask him to help the others and trust to charity for his



<P>pay.&nbsp; He smiled then, and was kinder, but it was very sad, and

I



<P>cried with them till he turned round all of a sudden, and told me



<P>to go home and take belladonna right away, or I'd have the fever."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, you won't!" cried Jo, hugging her close, with a frightened



<P>look.&nbsp; "Oh, Beth, if you should be sick I never could forgive myself!



<P>What shall we do?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't be frightened, I guess I shan't have it badly.&nbsp; I looked



<P>in Mother's book, and saw that it begins with headache, sore throat,



<P>and queer feelings like mine, so I did take some belladonna, and I



<P>feel better," said Beth, laying her cold hands on her hot forehead



<P>and trying to look well.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If Mother was only at home!" exclaimed Jo, seizing the book,



<P>and feeling that Washington was an immense way off.&nbsp; She read a

page,



<P>looked at Beth, felt her head, peeped into her throat, and then



<P>said gravely, "You've been over the baby every day for more than a



<P>week, and among the others who are going to have it, so I'm afraid



<P>you are going to have it, Beth.&nbsp; I'll call Hannah, she knows all



<P>about sickness."



<P>"Don't let Amy come.&nbsp; She never had it, and I should hate to



<P>give it to her.&nbsp; Can't you and Meg have it over again?" asked Beth,



<P>anxiously.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I guess not.&nbsp; Don't care if I do.&nbsp; Serve me right, selfish

pig,



<P>to let you go, and stay writing rubbish myself!" muttered Jo, as she



<P>went to consult Hannah.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The good soul was wide awake in a minute, and took the lead at



<P>once, assuring that there was no need to worry; every one had scarlet



<P>fever, and if rightly treated, nobody died, all of which Jo believed,



<P>and felt much relieved as they went up to call Meg.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now I'll tell you what we'll do," said Hannah, when she had



<P>examined and questioned Beth, "we will have Dr. Bangs, just to take



<P>a look at you, dear, and see that we start right.&nbsp; Then we'll send



<P>Amy off to Aunt March's for a spell, to keep her out of harm's way,



<P>and one of you girls can stay at home and amuse Beth for a day or two."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall stay, of course, I'm oldest," began Meg, looking anxious



<P>and self-reproachful.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall, because it's my fault she is sick.&nbsp; I told Mother I'd



<P>do the errands, and I haven't," said Jo decidedly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Which will you have, Beth?&nbsp; There ain't no need of but one,"



<P>aid Hannah.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Jo, please." And Beth leaned her head against her sister with



<P>a contented look, which effectually settled that point.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll go and tell Amy," said Meg, feeling a little hurt, yet



<P>rather relieved on the whole, for she did not like nursing, and Jo



<P>did.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy rebelled outright, and passionately declared that she had



<P>rather have the fever than go to Aunt March.&nbsp; Meg reasoned, pleaded,



<P>and commanded, all in vain.&nbsp; Amy protested that she would not go,



<P>and Meg left her in despair to ask Hannah what should be done.&nbsp;

Before



<P>she came back, Laurie walked into the parlor to find Amy sobbing, with



<P>her head in the sofa cushions.&nbsp; She told her story, expecting to

be



<P>consoled, but Laurie only put his hands in his pockets and walked



<P>about the room, whistling softly, as he knit his brows in deep



<P>thought.&nbsp; Presently he sat down beside her, and said, in his most



<P>wheedlesome tone, "Now be a sensible little woman, and do as they say.



<P>No, don't cry, but hear what a jolly plan I've got.&nbsp; You go to

Aunt



<P>March's, and I'll come and take you out every day, driving or walking,



<P>and we'll have capital times.&nbsp; Won't that be better than moping

here?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't wish to be sent off as if I was in the way," began Amy,



<P>in an injured voice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Bless your heart, child, it's to keep you well.&nbsp; You don't



<P>want to be sick, do you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I'm sure I don't, but I dare say I shall be, for I've been



<P>with Beth all the time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's the very reason you ought to go away at once, so that



<P>you may escape it.&nbsp; Change of air and care will keep you well,

I



<P>dare say, or if it does not entirely, you will have the fever more



<P>lightly.&nbsp; I advise you to be off as soon as you can, for scarlet

fever



<P>is no joke, miss."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But it's dull at Aunt March's, and she is so cross," said Amy,



<P>looking rather frightened.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It won't be dull with me popping; in every day to tell you how



<P>Beth is, and take you out gallivanting.&nbsp; The old lady likes me,

and



<P>I'll be as sweet as possible to her, so she won't peck at us,



<P>whatever we do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Will you take me out in the trotting wagon with Puck?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"On my honor as a gentleman."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And come every single day?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"See if I don't/"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And bring me back the minute Beth is well?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The identical minute."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And go to the theater, truly?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A dozen theaters, if we may."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well--I guess I will," said Amy slowly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Good girl!&nbsp; Call Meg, and tell her you'll give in," said



<P>Laurie, with an approving pat, which annoyed Amy more than the



<P>`giving in'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg and Jo came running down to behold the miracle which had



<P>been wrought, and Amy, feeling very precious and self-sacrificing,



<P>promised to go, if the doctor said Beth was going to be ill.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How is the little dear?" asked Laurie, for Beth was his



<P>especial pet, and he felt more anxious about her than he liked to



<P>show.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She is lying down on Mother's bed, and feels better.&nbsp; The



<P>baby's death troubled her, but I dare say she has only got cold.



<P>Hannah says she thinks so, but she looks worried, and that makes me



<P>fidgety," answered Meg.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What a trying world it is!" said Jo, rumpling up her hair in



<P>a fretful way.&nbsp; "No sooner do we get out of one trouble than down



<P>comes another.&nbsp; There doesn't seem to be anything to hold on to



<P>when Mother's gone, so I'm all at sea."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, don't make a porcupine of yourself, it isn't becoming.



<P>Settle your wig, Jo, and tell me if I shall telegraph to your mother,



<P>or do anything?" asked Laurie, who never had been reconciled to the



<P>loss of his friend's one beauty.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That is what troubles me," said Meg.&nbsp; "I think we ought to tell



<P>her if Beth is really ill, but Hannah says we mustn't, for Mother



<P>can't leave Father, and it will only make them anxious.&nbsp; Beth won't



<P>be sick long, and Hannah knows just what to do, and Mother said we



<P>were to mind her, so I suppose we must, but it doesn't seem quite



<P>right to me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hum, well, I can't say.&nbsp; Suppose you ask Grandfather after



<P>the doctor has been."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We will.&nbsp; Jo, go and get Dr. Bangs at once," commanded Meg.



<P>"We can't decide anything till he has been."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Stay where you are, Jo.&nbsp; I'm errand boy to this establishment,"



<P>said Laurie, taking up his cap.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm afraid you are busy," began Meg.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I've done my lessons for the day."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you study in vacation time?" asked Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I follow the good example my neighbors set me," was Laurie's



<P>answer, as he swung himself out of the room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have great hopes for my boy," observed Jo, watching him



<P>fly over the fence with an approving smile.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He does very well, for a boy," was Meg's somewhat ungracious



<P>answer, for the subject did not interest her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Dr. Bangs came, said Beth had symptoms of the fever, but he thought



<P>she would have it lightly, though he looked sober over the Hummel story.



<P>Amy was ordered off at once, and provided with something to ward



<P>off danger, she departed in great state, with Jo and Laurie as escort.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Aunt March received them with her usual hospitality.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What do you want now?" she asked, looking sharply over her



<P>spectacles, while the parrot, sitting on the back of her chair,



<P>called out...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Go away.&nbsp; No boys allowed here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie retired to the window, and Jo told her story.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No more than I expected, if you are allowed to go poking



<P>about among poor folks.&nbsp; Amy can stay and make herself useful



<P>if she isn't sick, which I've no doubt she will be, looks like



<P>it now.&nbsp; Don't cry, child, it worries me to hear people sniff."



<P>Amy was on the point of crying, but Laurie slyly pulled the



<P>parrot's tail, which caused Polly to utter an astonished croak and



<P>call out, "Bless my boots!" in such a funny way, that she laughed



<P>instead.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What do you hear from your mother?" asked the old lady



<P>gruffly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Father is much better," replied Jo, trying to keep sober.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, is her?&nbsp; Well, that won't last long, I fancy.&nbsp; March



<P>never had any stamina," was the cheerful reply.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ha, ha!&nbsp; Never say die, take a pinch of snuff, goodbye, goodbye!"



<P>squalled Polly, dancing on her perch, and clawing at the old



<P>lady's cap as Laurie tweaked him in the rear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird!&nbsp; And, Jo, you'd



<P>better go at once.&nbsp; It isn't proper to be gadding about so late

with



<P>a rattlepated boy like..."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hold your tongue, you disrespectful old bird!" cried Polly,



<P>tumbling off the chair with a bounce, and running to peck the



<P>`rattlepated' boy, who was shaking with laughter at the last speech.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't think I can bear it, but I'll try," thought Amy, as



<P>she was left alone with Aunt March.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Get along, you fright!" screamed Polly, and at that rude speech



<P>Amy could not restrain a sniff.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>"Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents," grumbled



<P>Jo, lying on the rug.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's so dreadful to be poor!" sighed Meg, looking down at



<P>her old dress.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't think it's fair for some girls to have plenty of



<P>pretty things, and other girls nothing at all," added little Amy,



<P>with an injured sniff.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We've got Father and Mother, and each other," said Beth



<P>contentedly from her corner.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened



<P>at the cheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly,



<P>"We haven't got Father, and shall not have him for a long time."



<P>She didn't say "perhaps never," but each silently added it, thinking



<P>of Father far away, where the fighting was.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone,



<P>"You know the reason Mother proposed not having any presents this



<P>Christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone;



<P>and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure, when



<P>our men are suffering so in the army.&nbsp; We can't do much, but we

can



<P>make our little sacrifices, and ought to do it gladly.&nbsp; But I am



<P>afraid I don't."&nbsp; And Meg shook her head, as she thought regretfully



<P>of all the pretty things she wanted.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But I don't think the little we should spend would do any



<P>good.&nbsp; We've each got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped



<P>by our giving that.&nbsp; I agree not to expect anything from Mother

or



<P>you, but I do want to buy UNDINE AND SINTRAM for myself.&nbsp; I've



<P>wanted it so long," said Jo, who was a bookworm.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I planned to spend mine in new music," said Beth, with a



<P>little sigh, which no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle



<P>holder.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing pencils.&nbsp; I



<P>really need them," said Amy decidedly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mother didn't say anything about our money, and she won't



<P>wish us to give up everything.&nbsp; Let's each buy what we want, and



<P>have a little fun.&nbsp; I'm sure we work hard enough to earn it," cried



<P>Jo, examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I know I do--teaching those tiresome children nearly all



<P>day, when I'm longing to enjoy myself at home," began Meg, in the



<P>complaining tone again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You don't have half such a hard time as I do," said Jo.



<P>"How would you like to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy



<P>old lady, who keeps you trotting, is never satisfied, and worries



<P>you till you you're ready to fly out the window or cry?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's naughty to fret, but I do think washing dishes and



<P>keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world.&nbsp; It makes me



<P>cross, and my hands get so stiff, I can't practice well at all."



<P>And Beth looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could



<P>hear that time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't believe any of you suffer as I do," cried Amy, "for



<P>you don't have to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague



<P>you if you don't know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and



<P>label your father if he isn't rich, and insult you when your nose



<P>isn't nice."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If you mean libel, I'd say so, and not talk about labels, as



<P>if Papa was a pickle bottle," advised Jo, laughing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I know what I mean, and you needn't be statirical about it.



<P>It's proper to use good words, and improve your vocabilary,"



<P>returned Amy, with dignity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't peck at one another, children.&nbsp; Don't you wish we



<P>had the money Papa lost when we were little, Jo?&nbsp; Dear me! How



<P>happy and good we'd be, if we had no worries!" said Meg, who



<P>could remember better times.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You said the other day you thought we were a deal happier



<P>than the King children, for they were fighting and fretting all



<P>the time, in spite of their money."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So I did, Beth.&nbsp; Well, I think we are.&nbsp; For though we do



<P>have to work, we make fun of ourselves, and are a pretty jolly



<P>set, as Jo would say."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Jo does use such slang words!" observed Amy, with a



<P>reproving look at the long figure stretched on the rug.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo immediately sat up, put her hands in her pockets, and



<P>began to whistle.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't, Jo.&nbsp; It's so boyish!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's why I do it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I detest rude, unladylike girls!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Birds in their little nests agree," sang Beth, the



<P>peacemaker, with such a funny face that both sharp voices



<P>softened to a laugh, and the "pecking" ended for that time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Really, girls, you are both to be blamed," said Meg,



<P>beginning to lecture in her elder-sisterly fashion."You are old



<P>enough to leave off boyish tricks, and to behave better,



<P>Josephine.&nbsp; It didn't matter so much when you were a little



<P>girl, but now you are so tall, and turn up your hair, you should



<P>remember that you are a young lady."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm not!&nbsp;&nbsp; And if turning up my hair makes me one, I'll



<P>wear it in two tails till I'm twenty," cried Jo, pulling off



<P>her net, and shaking down a chestnut mane.&nbsp; "I hate to think



<P>I've got to grow up, and be Miss March, and wear long gowns,



<P>and look as prim as a China Aster!&nbsp; It's bad enough to be a



<P>girl, anyway, when I like boy's games and work and manners!&nbsp; I



<P>can't get over my disappointment in not being a boy.&nbsp; And it's



<P>worse than ever now, for I'm dying to go and fight with Papa.



<P>And I can only stay home and knit, like a poky old woman!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And Jo shook the blue army sock till the needles rattled



<P>like castanets, and her ball bounded across the room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Poor Jo!&nbsp; It's too bad, but it can't be helped.&nbsp; So you



<P>must try to be contented with making your name boyish, and



<P>playing brother to us girls," said Beth, stroking the rough



<P>head with a hand that all the dish washing and dusting in the



<P>world could not make ungentle in its touch.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"As for you, Amy," continued Meg, "you are altogether



<P>to particular and prim.&nbsp; Your airs are funny now, but you'll



<P>grow up an affected little goose, if you don't take care.&nbsp; I



<P>I like your nice manners and refined ways of speaking, when



<P>you don't try to be elegant.&nbsp; But your absurd words are as bad



<P>as Jo's slang."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If Jo is a tomboy and Amy a goose, what am I, please?"



<P>asked Beth, ready to share the lecture.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You're a dear, and nothing else," answered Meg warmly,



<P>and no one contradicted her, for the `Mouse' was the pet of the



<P>family.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As young readers like to know `how people look', we will



<P>take this moment to give them a little sketch of the four



<P>sisters, who sat knitting away in the twilight, while the



<P>December snow fell quietly without, and the fire crackled



<P>cheerfully within.&nbsp; It was a comfortable room, though the carpet



<P>was faded and the furniture very plain, for a good picture or



<P>two hung on the walls, books filled the recesses, chrysanthemums



<P>and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and a pleasant



<P>atmosphere of home peace pervaded it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Margaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty,



<P>being plump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft brown hair, a



<P>sweet mouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain.&nbsp; Fifteen-



<P>year-old Jo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a



<P>colt, for she never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs,



<P>which were very much in her way.&nbsp; She had a decided mouth, a comical



<P>nose, and sharp, gray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and



<P>were by turns fierce, funny, or thoughtful.&nbsp; Her long, thick hair



<P>was her one beauty, but it was usually bundled into a net, to be



<P>out of her way.&nbsp; Round shoulders had Jo, big hands and feet,



<P>a flyaway look to her clothes, and the uncomfortable appearance of



<P>a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a woman and didn't like it.



<P>Elizabeth, or Beth, as everyone called her, was a rosy, smooth-



<P>haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy manner, a timid



<P>voice, and a ;peaceful expression which was seldom disturbed.&nbsp;

Her



<P>father called her `Little Miss Tranquility', and the name suited



<P>her excellently, for she seemed to live in a happy world of her



<P>own, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved.



<P>Amy, though the youngest, was a most important person, in her own



<P>opinion at least.&nbsp; A regular snow maiden, with blue eyes, and



<P>yellow hair curling on her shoulders, pale and slender, and always



<P>carrying herself like a young lady mindful of her manners.&nbsp; What



<P>the characters of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The clock struck six and, having swept up the hearth, Beth



<P>put a pair of slippers down to warm.&nbsp; Somehow the sight of the

old



<P>shoes had a good effect upon the girls, for Mother was coming, and



<P>everyone brightened to welcome her.&nbsp; Meg stopped lecturing, and



<P>lighted the lamp, Amy got out of the easy chair without being asked,



<P>and Jo forgot how tired she was as she sat up to hold the slippers



<P>nearer to the blaze.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They are quite worn out.&nbsp; Marmee must have a new pair."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I thought I'd get her some with my dollar," said Beth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I shall!" cried Amy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm the oldest," began Meg, but Jo cut in with a decided,



<P>"I'm the man of the family now Papa is away, and I shall provide



<P>the slippers, for he told me to take special care of Mother while



<P>he was gone."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll tell you what we'll do," said Beth, "let's each get her



<P>something for Christmas, land not get anything for ourselves."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's like you, dear!&nbsp; What will we get?" exclaimed Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Everyone thought soberly for a minute, then Meg announced, as



<P>if the idea was suggested by the sight of her own pretty hands,



<P>"I shall give her a nice pair of gloves."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Army shoes, best to be had," cried Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed," said Beth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll get a little bottle of cologne.&nbsp; She likes it, and it won't



<P>cost much, so I'll have some left to buy my pencils," added Amy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How will we give the things?" asked Meg.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Put them on the table, and bring her in and see her open



<P>the bundles.&nbsp; Don't you remember how we used to do on our



<P>birthdays?" answered Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I used to be so frightened when it was my turn to sit in the



<P>chair with the crown on, and see you all come marching round to



<P>give the presents, with a kiss.&nbsp; I liked the things and the kisses,



<P>but it was dreadful to have you sit looking at me while I opened



<P>the bundles," said Beth, who was toasting her face and the bread



<P>for tea at the same time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Let Marmee think we are getting things for ourselves, and



<P>then surprise her.&nbsp; We must go shopping tomorrow afternoon, Meg.



<P>There is so much to do about the play for Christmas night," said



<P>Jo, marching up and down, with her hands behind her back, and her



<P>nose in the air.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't mean to act any more after this time.&nbsp; I'm getting



<P>too old for such things," observed Meg, who was as much a child



<P>as ever about `dressing-up' frolics.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You won't stop, I know, as long as you can trail round in a



<P>white gown with your hair down, and wear gold-paper jewelry.



<P>You are the best actress we've got, and there'll be an end



<P>of everything if you quit the boards," said Jo.&nbsp; "We ought



<P>to rehearse tonight.&nbsp; Come here, Amy, and do the fainting scene,



<P>for you are as stiff as a poker in that."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I can't help it.&nbsp; I never saw anyone faint, and I don't choose



<P>to make myself all black and blue, tumbling flat as you do.&nbsp; If

I



<P>can go down easily, I'll drop.&nbsp; If I can't, I shall fall into a



<P>chair and be graceful.&nbsp; I don't care if Hugo does come at me with



<P>a pistol," returned Amy, who was not gifted with dramatic power,



<P>but was chosen because she was small enough to be borne out shrieking



<P>by the villain of the piece.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do it this way.&nbsp; Clasp your hands so, and stagger across the



<P>room, crying frantically, `Roderigo Save me! Save me!' and away



<P>went Jo, with a melodramatic scream which was truly thrilling.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy followed, but she poked her hands out stiffly before her,



<P>and jerked herself along as if she went by machinery, and her "Ow!"



<P>was more suggestive of pins being run into her than of fear and



<P>anguish.&nbsp; Jo gave a despairing groan, and Meg laughed outright,



<P>while Beth let her bread burn as she watched the fun with interest.



<P>"It's no use!&nbsp; Do the best you can when the time comes, and if



<P>the audience laughs, don't blame me.&nbsp; Come on, Meg."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then things went smoothly, for Don Pedro defied the world in



<P>a speech of two pages without a single break.&nbsp; Hagar, the witch,



<P>chanted an awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads,



<P>with weird effect.&nbsp; Roderigo rent his chains asunder manfully,

and



<P>Hugo died in agonies of remorse and arsenic, with a wild, "Ha! Ha!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's the best we've had yet," said Meg, as the dead villain



<P>sat up and rubbed his elbows.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't see how you can write and act such splendid things,



<P>Jo.&nbsp; You're a regular Shakespeare!" exclaimed Beth, who firmly



<P>believed that her sisters were gifted with wonderful genius in all



<P>things.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not quite," replied Jo modestly.&nbsp; "I do think THE WITCHES CURSE,



<P>an Operatic Tragedy is rather a nice thing, but I'd like to try



<P>McBETH, if we only had a trapdoor for Banquo.&nbsp; I always wanted

to



<P>do the killing part.&nbsp; `Is that a dagger that I see before me?"



<P>muttered Jo, rolling her eyes and clutching at the air, as she had



<P>seen a famous tragedian do.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, it's the toasting fork, with Mother's shoe on it instead



<P>of the bread.&nbsp; Beth's stage-struck!" cried Meg, and the rehearsal



<P>ended in a general burst of laughter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Glad to find you so merry, my girls," said a cheery voice at



<P>the door, and actors and audience turned to welcome a tall, motherly



<P>lady with a `can I help you' look about her which was truly delightful.



<P>She was not elegantly dressed, but a noble-looking woman, and the



<P>girls thought the gray cloak and unfashionable bonnet covered the most



<P>splendid mother in the world.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, dearies, how have you got on today?&nbsp; There was so much to



<P>do, getting the boxes ready to go tomorrow, that I didn't come home



<P>to dinner.&nbsp; Has anyone called, Beth?&nbsp; How is your cold, Meg?&nbsp;

Jo,



<P>you look tired to death.&nbsp; Come and kiss me, baby."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While making these maternal inquiries Mrs. March got her wet



<P>things off, her warm slippers on, and sitting down in the easy



<P>chair, drew Amy to her lap, preparing to enjoy the happiest hour



<P>of her busy day.&nbsp; The girls flew about, trying to make things



<P>comfortable, each in her own way.&nbsp; Meg arranged the tea table,

Jo



<P>brought wood and set chairs, dropping, over-turning, and clattering



<P>everything she touched.&nbsp; Beth trotted to and fro between parlor



<P>kitchen, quiet and busy, while Amy gave directions to everyone, as



<P>she sat with her hands folded.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As they gathered about the table, Mrs. March said, with a



<P>particularly happy face, "I've got a treat for you after supper."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A quick, bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine.



<P>Beth clapped her hands, regardless of the biscuit she held,



<P>and Jo tossed up her napkin, crying, "A letter!&nbsp; A letter!&nbsp;

Three



<P>cheers for Father!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, a nice long letter.&nbsp; He is well, and thinks he shall



<P>get through the cold season better than we feared.&nbsp; He sends all



<P>sorts of loving wishes for Christmas, and an especial message



<P>to you girls," said Mrs. March, patting her pocket as if she



<P>had got a treasure there.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hurry and get done!&nbsp; Don't stop to quirk your little finger



<P>and simper over your plate, Amy," cried Jo, choking on her tea



<P>and dropping her bread, butter side down, on the carpet in her



<P>haste to get at the treat.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Beth ate no more, but crept away to sit in her shadowy corner



<P>and brood over the delight to come, till the others were ready.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think it was so splendid in Father to go as chaplain



<P>when he was too old to be drafted, and not strong enough for



<P>a soldier," said Meg warmly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't I wish I could go as a drummer, a vivan--what's its



<P>name?&nbsp; Or a nurse, so I could be near him and help him," exclaimed



<P>Jo, with a groan.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It must be very disagreeable to sleep in a tent, and eat



<P>all sorts of bad-tasting things, and drink out of a tin mug,"



<P>sighed Amy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"When will he come home, Marmee?&nbsp; asked Beth, with a little



<P>quiver in her voice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not for many months, dear, unless he is sick.&nbsp; He will stay



<P>and do his work faithfully as long as he can, and we won't ask



<P>for him back a minute sooner than he can be spared.&nbsp; Now come and



<P>hear the letter."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They all drew to the fire, Mother in the big chair with Beth



<P>at her feet, Meg and Amy perched on either arm of the chair, and



<P>Jo leaning on the back, where no one would see any sign of emotion



<P>if the letter should happen to be touching.&nbsp; Very few letters were



<P>written in those hard times that were not touching, especially



<P>those which fathers sent home.&nbsp; In this one little was said of

the



<P>hardships endured, the dangers faced, or the homesickness conquered.



<P>It was a cheerful, hopeful letter, full of lively descriptions



<P>of camp life, marches, and military news, and only at the end



<P>did the writer's heart over-flow with fatherly love and longing



<P>for the little girls at home.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Give them all of my dear love and a kiss.&nbsp; Tell them I think



<P>of them by day, pray for them by night, and find my best comfort



<P>in their affection at all times.&nbsp; A year seems very long to wait



<P>before I see them, but remind them that while we wait we may all



<P>work, so that these hard days need not be wasted.&nbsp; I know they

will



<P>remember all I said to them, that they will be loving children to



<P>you, will do their duty faithfully, fight their bosom enemies bravely,



<P>and conquer themselves so beautifully that when I come back to them



<P>I may be fonder and prouder than ever of my little women."



<P>Everybody sniffed when they came to that part.&nbsp; Jo wasn't



<P>ashamed of the great tear that dropped off the end of her nose, and



<P>Amy never minded the rumpling of her curls as she hid her face on



<P>her mother's shoulder and sobbed out, "I am a selfish girl!&nbsp; But



<P>I'll truly try to be better, so he mayn't be disappointed in me



<P>by-and-by."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>We all will," cried Meg.&nbsp; "I think too much of my looks and



<P>hate to work, but won't any more, if I can help it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll try and be what he loves to call me, `a little woman'



<P>and not be rough and wild, but do my duty here instead of wanting



<P>to be somewhere else," said Jo, thinking that keeping her temper



<P>at home was a much harder task than facing a rebel or two down South.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Beth said nothing, but wiped away her tears with the blue army



<P>sock and began to knit with all her might, losing no time in doing



<P>the duty that lay nearest her, while she resolved in her quiet



<P>little soul to be all that Father hoped to find her when the year



<P>brought round the happy coming home.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. March broke the silence that followed Jo's words, by



<P>saying in her cheery voice, "Do you remember how you used to play



<P>Pilgrims Progress when you were little things?&nbsp; Nothing delighted



<P>you more than to have me tie my piece bags on your backs for burdens,



<P>give you hats and sticks and rolls of paper, and let you travel



<P>through the house from the cellar, which was the City of Destruction,



<P>up, up, to the housetop, where you had all the lovely things you



<P>could collect to make a Celestial City."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What fun it was, especially going by the lions, fighting



<P>Apollyon, and passing through the valley where the hob-goblins



<P>were," said Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I liked the place where the bundles fell off and tumbled



<P>downstairs," said Meg.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't remember much about it, except that I was afraid of



<P>the cellar and the dark entry, and always liked the cake and milk



<P>we had up at the top.&nbsp; If I wasn't too old for such things, I'd



<P>rather like to play it over again," said Amy, who began to talk



<P>of renouncing childish things at the mature age of twelve.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We never are too old for this, my dear, because it is a play



<P>we are playing all the time in one way or another.&nbsp; Out burdens

are



<P>here, our road is before us, and the longing for goodness and



<P>happiness is the guide that leads us through many troubles and



<P>mistakes to the peace which is a true Celestial City.&nbsp; Now, my

little



<P>pilgrims, suppose you begin again, not in play, but in earnest,



<P>and see how far on you can get before Father comes home."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Really, Mother?&nbsp; Where are our bundles?" asked Amy, who was



<P>a very literal young lady.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Each of you told what your burden was just now, except Beth.



<P>I rather think she hasn't got any," said her mother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, I have.&nbsp; Mine is dishes and dusters, and envying girls



<P>with nice pianos, and being afraid of people."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Beth's bundle was such a funny one that everybody wanted to



<P>laugh, but nobody did, for it would have hurt her feelings very



<P>much.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Let us do it," said Meg thoughtfully.&nbsp; "It is only another



<P>name for trying to be good, and the story may help us, for though



<P>we do want to be good, it's hard work and we forget, and don't do



<P>our best."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We were in the Slough of Despond tonight, and Mother came



<P>and pulled us out as Help did in the book.&nbsp; We ought to have our



<P>roll of directions, like Christian.&nbsp; What shall we do about that?"



<P>asked Jo, delighted with the fancy which lent a little romance to



<P>the very dull task of doing her duty.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Look under your pillows christmas morning, and you will



<P>find your guidebook," replied Mrs. March.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They talked over the new plan while old Hannah cleared the



<P>table, then out came the four little work baskets, and the needles



<P>flew as the girls made sheets for Aunt March.&nbsp; It was uninteresting



<P>sewing, but tonight no one grumbled.&nbsp; They adopted Jo's plan of



<P>dividing the long seams into four parts, and calling the quarters



<P>Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, and in that way got on capitally,



<P>especially when they talked about the different countries as they



<P>stitched their way through them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At nine they stopped work, and sang, as usual, before they



<P>went to bed.&nbsp; No one but Beth could get much music out of the old



<P>piano, but she had a way of softly touching the yellow keys and



<P>making a pleasant accompaniment to the simple songs they sang.&nbsp;

Meg



<P>had a voice like a flute, and she and herr mother led the little



<P>choir.&nbsp; Amy chirped like a cricket, and Jo wandered through the

airs



<P>at her own sweet will, always coming out at the wrong place with a



<P>croak or a quaver that spoiled the most pensive tune.&nbsp; They had



<P>always done this from the time they could lisp...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Crinkle, crinkle, 'ittle 'tar,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>and it had become a household custom, for the mother was a born



<P>singer.&nbsp; The first sound in the morning was her voice as she went



<P>about the house singing like a lark, and the last sound at night



<P>was the same cheery sound, for the girls never grew too old for



<P>that familiar lullaby.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"November is the most disagreeable month in the whole year,"



<P>said Margaret, standing at the window one dull afternoon,



<P>looking out at the frostbitten garden.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's the reason I was born in it," observed Jo pensively,



<P>quite unconscious of the blot on her nose.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If something very pleasant should happen now, we should



<P>think it a delightful month," said Beth, who took a hopeful view



<P>of everything, even November.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I dare say, but nothing pleasant ever does happen in this



<P>family," said Meg, who was out of sorts.&nbsp; "We go grubbing along



<P>day after day, without a bit of change, and very little fun.&nbsp; We



<P>might as well be in a treadmill."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My patience, how blue we are!" cried Jo.&nbsp; "I don't much



<P>wonder, poor dear, for you see other girls having splendid times,



<P>while you grind, grind, year in and year out.&nbsp; Oh, don't I wish



<P>I could manage things for you as I do for my heroines!&nbsp; You're



<P>pretty enough and good enough already, so I'd have some rich relation



<P>leave you a fortune unexpectedly.&nbsp; Then you'd dash out as an heiress,



<P>scorn everyone who has slighted you, go abroad, and come home my Lady



<P>Something in a blaze of splendor and elegance."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"People don't have fortunes left them in that style nowadays,



<P>men have to work and women marry for money.&nbsp; It's a dreadfully

unjust



<P>world," said Meg bitterly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Jo and I are going to make fortunes for you all.&nbsp; Just wait ten



<P>years, and see if we don't," said Amy, who sat in a corner making mud



<P>pies, as Hannah called her little clay models of birds, fruit, and



<P>faces.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Can't wait, and I'm afraid I haven't much faith in ink and dirt,



<P>though I'm grateful for your good intentions.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg sighed, and turned to the frostbitten garden again.&nbsp; Jo



<P>groaned and leaned both elbows on the table in a despondent attitude,



<P>but Amy spatted away energetically, and Beth, who sat at the other



<P>window, said, smiling, "Two pleasant things are going to happen



<P>right away.&nbsp; Marmee is coming down the street, and Laurie is tramping



<P>through the garden as if he had something nice to tell."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In they both came, Mrs. March with her usual question, "Any letter



<P>from Father, girls?" and Laurie to say in his persuasive way, "Won't



<P>some of you come for a drive?&nbsp; I've been working away at mathematics



<P>till my head is in a muddle, and I'm going to freshen my wits by a



<P>brisk turn.&nbsp; It's a dull day, but the air isn't bad, and I'm going

to



<P>take Brooke home, so it will be gay inside, if it isn't out.&nbsp; Come,



<P>Jo, you and Beth will go, won't you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Of course we will."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Much obliged, but I'm busy."&nbsp; And Meg whisked out her workbasket,



<P>for she had agreed with her mother that it was best, for her at least,



<P>not to drive too often with the young gentleman.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We three will be ready in a minute," cried Amy, running away to



<P>wash her hands.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Can I do anything for you, Madam Mother?" asked Laurie, leaning



<P>over Mrs. March's chair with the affectionate look and tone he always



<P>gave her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, thank you, except call at the office, if you'll be so kind,



<P>dear.&nbsp; It's our day for a letter, and the postman hasn't been.&nbsp;

Father



<P>is as regular as the sun, but there's some delay on the way, perhaps."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A sharp ring interrupted her, and a minute after Hannah came in



<P>with a letter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's one of them horrid telegraph things, mum," she said,



<P>handling it as if she was afraid it would explode and do some damage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At the word `telegraph', Mrs. March snatched it, read the two



<P>lines it contained, and dropped back into her chair as white as if



<P>the little paper had sent a bullet to her heart.&nbsp; Laurie dashed



<P>downstairs for water, while Meg and Hannah supported her, and Jo read



<P>aloud, in a frightened voice...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. March:



<P>Your husband is very ill.&nbsp; Come at once.



<P>S.&nbsp; HALE



<P>Blank Hospital, Washington.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>How still the room was as they listened breathlessly, how



<P>strangely the day darkened outside, and how suddenly the whole world



<P>seemed to change, as the girls gathered about their mother, feeling



<P>as if all the happiness and support of their lives was about to be



<P>taken from them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. March was herself again directly, read the message over,



<P>and stretched out her arms to her daughters, saying, in a tone they



<P>never forgot, "I shall go at once, but it may be too late.&nbsp; Oh,



<P>children, children, help me to bear it!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For several minutes there was nothing but the sound of sobbing



<P>in the room, mingled with broken words of comfort, tender assurances



<P>of help, and hopeful whispers that died away in tears.&nbsp; Poor Hannah



<P>was the first to recover, and with unconscious wisdom she set all the



<P>rest a good example, for with her, work was panacea for most



<P>afflictions.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The Lord keep the dear man!&nbsp; I won't waste no time a-cryin',



<P>but git your things ready right away, mum," she said heartily, as she



<P>wiped her face on her apron, gave her mistress a warm shake of the



<P>hand with her own hard one, and went away to work like three women



<P>in one.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She's right, there's no time for tears now.&nbsp; Be calm, girls,



<P>and let me think."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They tried to be calm, poor things, as their mother sat up,



<P>looking pale but steady, and put away her grief to think and plan



<P>for them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Where's Laurie?' she asked presently, when she had collected



<P>her thoughts and decided on the first duties to be done.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here, ma'am.&nbsp; Oh, let me do something!" cried the boy,



<P>hurrying from the next room whither he had withdrawn, feeling that



<P>their first sorrow was too sacred for even his friendly eyes to see.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Send a telegram saying I will come at once.&nbsp; The next train



<P>goes early in the morning.&nbsp; I'll take that."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What else?&nbsp; The horses are ready.&nbsp; I can go anywhere, do



<P>anything," he said, looking ready to fly to the ends of the earth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Leave a note at Aunt March's.&nbsp; Jo, give me that pen and paper."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Tearing off the blank side of one of her newly copied pages,



<P>Jo drew the table before her mother, well knowing that money for the



<P>long, sad journey must be borrowed, and feeling as if she could do



<P>anything to add to a little to the sum for her father.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now go, dear, but don't kill yourself driving at a desperate



<P>pace.&nbsp; There is no need of that."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. March's warning was evidently thrown away, for five minutes



<P>later Laurie tore by the window on his own fleet horse, riding as if



<P>for his life.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Jo, run to the rooms, and tell Mrs. King that I can't come.



<P>On the way get these things.&nbsp; I'll put them down, they'll be needed



<P>and I must go prepared for nursing.&nbsp; Hospital stores are not always



<P>good.&nbsp; Beth, go and ask Mr. Laurence for a couple of bottles of

old



<P>wine.&nbsp; I'm not too proud to beg for Father.&nbsp; He shall have

the best



<P>of everything.&nbsp; Amy, tell Hannah to get down the black trunk, and



<P>Meg, come and help me find my things, for I'm half bewildered."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Writing, thinking, and directing all at once might well bewilder



<P>the poor lady, and Meg begged her to sit quietly in her room



<P>for a little while, and let them work.&nbsp; Everyone scattered



<P>like leaves before a gust of wind, and the quiet, happy household



<P>was broken up as suddenly as if the paper had been an evil spell.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Laurence came hurrying back with Beth, bringing every



<P>comfort the kind old gentleman could think of for the invalid, and



<P>friendliest promises of protection for the girls during the mother's



<P>absence, which comforted her very much.&nbsp; There was nothing he didn't



<P>offer, from his own dressing gown to himself as escort.&nbsp; But the



<P>last was impossible.&nbsp; Mrs. March would not hear of the old



<P>gentleman's undertaking the long journey, yet an expression of relief

was



<P>visible when he spoke of it, for anxiety ill fits one for traveling.



<P>He saw the look, knit his heavy eyebrows, rubbed his hands, and



<P>marched abruptly away, saying he'd be back directly.&nbsp; No one had



<P>time to think of him again till, as Meg ran through the entry, with



<P>a pair of rubbers in one hand and a cup of tea in the other, she



<P>came suddenly upon Mr. Brooke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm very sorry to hear of this, Miss March," he said, in the



<P>kind, quiet tone which sounded very pleasantly to her perturbed



<P>spirit.&nbsp; "I came to offer myself as escort to your mother.&nbsp;

Mr.



<P>Laurence has commissions for me in Washington, and it will give me



<P>real satisfaction to be of service to her there."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Down dropped the rubbers, and the tea was very near following,



<P>as Meg put out her hand, with a face so full of gratitude that Mr.



<P>Brooke would have felt repaid for a much greater sacrifice than



<P>the trifling one of time and comfort which he was about to take.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How kind you all are!&nbsp; Mother will accept, I'm sure, and it



<P>will be such a relief to know that she has someone to take care of



<P>her.&nbsp; Thank you very, very much!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg spoke earnestly, and forgot herself entirely till something



<P>in the brown eyes looking down at her made her remember the



<P>cooling tea, and lead the way into the parlor, saying she would



<P>call her mother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Everything was arranged by the time Laurie returned with a



<P>note from Aunt March, enclosing the desired sum, and a few lines



<P>repeating what she had often said before, that she had always told



<P>them it was absurd for March to go into the army, always predicted



<P>that no good would come of it, and she hoped they would take her



<P>advice the next time.&nbsp; Mrs. March put the note in the fire, the



<P>money in her purse, and went on with her preparations, with her



<P>lips folded tightly in a way which Jo would have understood if she



<P>had been there.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The short afternoon wore away.&nbsp; All other errands were done,



<P>and Meg and her mother busy at some necessary needlework, while



<P>Beth and Amy goth tea, and Hannah finished her ironing with what



<P>she called a `slap and a bang', but still Jo did not come.&nbsp; They



<P>began to get anxious, and Laurie went off to find her, for no one



<P>knew what freak Jo might take into her head.&nbsp; He missed her,



<P>however, and she came walking in with a very queer expression of



<P>countenance, for there was a mixture of fun and fear, satisfaction



<P>and regret in it, which puzzled the family as much as did the roll



<P>of bills she laid before her mother, saying with a little choke in



<P>her voice, "That's my contribution toward making Father comfortable



<P>and bringing him home!"



<P>"My dear, where did you get it?&nbsp; Twenty-five dollars!&nbsp; Jo,

I



<P>hope you haven't done anything rash?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, it's mine honestly.&nbsp; I didn't beg, borrow, or steal it.&nbsp;

I



<P>earned it, and I don't think you'll blame me, for I only sold what



<P>was my own."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As she spoke, Jo took off her bonnet, and a general outcry arose,



<P>for all her abundant hair was cut short.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your hair!&nbsp; Your beautiful hair!"&nbsp; "Oh, Jo, how could you?

Your



<P>one beauty."&nbsp; "My dear girl, there was no need of this."&nbsp;

"She doesn't



<P>look like my Jo any more, but I love her dearly for it!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As everyone exclaimed, and Beth hugged the cropped head tenderly,



<P>Jo assumed an indifferent air, which did not deceive anyone a particle,



<P>and said, rumpling up the brown bush and trying to look as if she liked



<P>it, "It doesn't affect the fate of the nation, so don't wail, Beth.&nbsp;

It



<P>will be good for my vanity, I getting too proud of my wig.&nbsp; It

will do



<P>my brains good to have that mop taken off.&nbsp; My head feels deliciously



<P>light and cool, and the barber said I could soon have a curly crop,



<P>which will be boyish, becoming, and easy to keep in order.&nbsp; I'm

satisfied,



<P>so please take the money and let's have supper."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Tell me all about it, Jo.&nbsp; I am not quite satisfied, but I can't



<P>blame you, for I know how willingly you sacrificed your vanity, as



<P>you call it, to your love.&nbsp; But, my dear, it was not necessary,

and



<P>I'm afraid you will regret it one of these days," said Mrs. March.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I won't!" returned Jo stoutly, feeling much relieved that



<P>her prank was not entirely condemned.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What made you do it?" asked Amy, who would as soon have thought



<P>of cutting off her head as her pretty hair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I was wild to to something for Father," replied Jo, as



<P>they gathered about the table, for healthy young people can eat even



<P>in the midst of trouble.&nbsp; "I hate to borrow as much as Mother does,



<P>and I knew Aunt March would croak, she always does, if you ask for



<P>a ninepence.&nbsp; Meg gave all her quarterly salary toward the rent,

and



<P>I only got some clothes with mine, so I felt wicked, and was bound



<P>to have some money, if I sold the nose off my face to get it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You needn't feel wicked, my child! You had no winter things and



<P>got the simplest with your own hard earnings," said Mrs. March with

a



<P>look that warmed Jo's heart.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hadn't the least idea of selling my hair at first, but as I



<P>went along I kept thinking what I could do, and feeling as if I'd



<P>like to dive into some of the rich stores and help myself.&nbsp; In

a



<P>barber's window I saw tails of hair with the prices marked, and one



<P>black tail, not so thick as mine, was forty dollars.&nbsp; It came to

me



<P>all of a sudden that I had one thing to make money out of, and



<P>without stopping to think, I walked in, asked if they bought hair,



<P>and what they would give for mine."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't see how you dared to do it," said Beth in a tone of awe.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, he was a little man who looked as if he merely lived to oil



<P>his hair.&nbsp; He rather stared at first, as if he wasn't used to having



<P>girls bounce into his shop and ask him to buy their hair.&nbsp; He said

he



<P>didn't care about mine, it wasn't the fashionable color, and he never



<P>paid much for it in the first place.&nbsp; The work he put it into it

made



<P>it dear, and so on.&nbsp; It was getting late, and I was afraid if it



<P>wasn't done right away that I shouldn't have it done at all, and you



<P>know when I start to do a thing, I hate to give it up.&nbsp; So I begged



<P>him to take it, and told him why I was in such a hurry.&nbsp; It was



<P>silly, I dare say, but it changed his mind, for I got rather excited,



<P>and told the story in my topsy-turvy way, and his wife heard, and



<P>said so kindly, `Take it, Thomas, and oblige the young lady.&nbsp; I'd

do



<P>as much for our Jimmy any day if I had a spire of hair worth selling."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Who was Jimmy?" asked Amy, who liked to have things explained



<P>as they went along.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Her son, she said, who was in the army.&nbsp; How friendly such



<P>things make strangers feel, don't they?&nbsp; She talked away all the



<P>time the man clipped, and diverted my mind nicely."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Didn't you feel dreadfully when the first cut came?" asked



<P>Meg, with a shiver.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I took a last look at my hair while the man got his things,



<P>and that was the end of it.&nbsp; I never snivel over trifles like that.



<P>I will confess, though, I felt queer when I saw the dear old hair



<P>laid out on the table, and felt only the short rough ends of my head.



<P>It almost seemed as if I'd an arm or leg off.&nbsp; The woman saw me

look



<P>at it, and picked out a long lock for me to keep.&nbsp; I'll give it

to



<P>you, Marmee, just to remember past glories by, for a crop is so



<P>comfortable I don't think I shall ever have a mane again."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. March folded the wavy chestnut lock, and laid it away with



<P>a short gray one in her desk.&nbsp; She only said, "Thank you, deary,"



<P>but something in her face made the girls change the subject, and



<P>talk as cheerfully as they could about Mr. Brooke's kindness, the



<P>prospect of a fine day tomorrow, and the happy times they would have



<P>when Father came home to be nursed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>No one wanted to go to bed when at ten o'clock Mrs. March put



<P>by the last finished job, and said, "Come girls."&nbsp; Beth went to

the



<P>piano and played the father's favorite hymn.&nbsp; All began bravely,

but



<P>broke down one by one till Beth was left alone, singing with all her



<P>heart, for to her music was always a sweet consoler.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Go to bed and don't talk, for we must be up early and shall



<P>need all the sleep we can get.&nbsp; Good night, my darlings," said

Mrs.



<P>March, as the hymn ended, for no one cared to try another.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They kissed her quietly, and went to bed as silently as if the



<P>dear invalid lay in the next room.&nbsp; Beth and Amy soon fell asleep

in



<P>spite of the great trouble, but Meg lay awake, thinking the most



<P>serious thoughts she had ever known in her short life.&nbsp; Jo lay



<P>motionless, and her sister fancied that she was asleep, till a stifled



<P>sob made her exclaim, as she touched a wet cheek...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Jo, dear, what is it?&nbsp; Are you crying about father?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, not now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What then?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My...My hair!" burst out poor Jo, trying vainly to smother



<P>her emotion in the pillow.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It did not seem at all comical to Meg, who kissed and caressed



<P>the afflicted heroine in the tenderest manner.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm not sorry," protested Jo, with a choke.&nbsp; "I'd do it again



<P>tomorrow, if I could.&nbsp; It's only the vain part of me that goes

and



<P>cries in this silly way.&nbsp; Don't tell anyone, it's all over now.&nbsp;

I



<P>thought you were asleep, so I just made a little private moan for my



<P>one beauty.&nbsp; How came you to be awake?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I can't sleep, I'm so anxious," said Meg.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Think about something pleasant, and you'll soon drop off."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I tried it, but felt wider awake than ever."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What did you think of?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Handsome faces--eyes particularly," answered Meg, smiling to



<P>herself in the dark.



<P>"What color do you like best?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Brown, that is, sometimes.&nbsp; Blue are lovely."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo, laughed, and Meg sharply ordered her not to talk, then



<P>amiably promised to make her hair curl, and fell asleep to dream of



<P>living in her castle in the air.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The clocks were striking midnight and the rooms were very still



<P>as a figure glided quietly from bed to bed, smoothing a coverlet here,



<P>settling a pillow there, and pausing to look long and tenderly at each



<P>unconscious face, to kiss each with lips that mutely blessed, and to



<P>pray the fervent prayers which only mothers utter.&nbsp; As she lifted

the



<P>curtain to look out into the dreary night, the moon broke suddenly



<P>from behind the clouds and shone upon her like a bright, benignant



<P>face, which seemed to whisper in the silence," Be comforted, dear



<P>soul!&nbsp; There is always light behind the clouds."

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Come, Jo, it's time."



<P>"For what?"



<P>"You don't mean to say you have forgotten that you promised



<P>to make half a dozen calls with me today?"

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I've done a good many rash and foolish things in my life,



<P>but I don't think I ever was mad enough to say I'd make six calls



<P>in one day, when a single one upsets me for a week."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, you did, it was a bargain between us.&nbsp; I was to finish



<P>the crayon of Beth for you, and you were to go properly with me,



<P>and return our neighbors' visits."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If it was fair, that was in the bond, and I stand to the



<P>letter of my bond, Shylock.&nbsp; There is a pile of clouds in the east,



<P>it's not fair, and I don't go."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now, that's shirking.&nbsp; It's a lovely day, no prospect of rain,



<P>and you pride yourself on keeping; promises, so be honorable, come



<P>and do your duty, and then be at peace for another six months."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At that minute Jo was particularly absorbed in dressmaking,



<P>for she was mantua-maker general to the family, and took especial



<P>credit to herself because she could use a needle as well as a pen.



<P>It was very provoking to be arrested in the act of a first tryingon,



<P>and ordered out to make calls in her best array on a warm July day.



<P>She hated calls of the formal sort, and never made any till Amy



<P>compelled her with a bargain, bribe, or promise.&nbsp; In the present



<P>instance there was no escape, and having clashed her scissors



<P>rebelliously, while protesting that she smelled thunder, she gave in,



<P>put away her work, and taking up her hat and gloves with an air of



<P>resignation, told Amy the victim was ready.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Jo March, you are perverse enough to provoke a saint!&nbsp; You don't



<P>intend to make calls in that state, I hope," cried Amy, surveying



<P>her with amazement.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why not?&nbsp; I'm neat and cool and comfortable, quite proper



<P>for a dusty walk on a warm day.&nbsp; If people care more for my



<P>clothes than they do for me, I don't wish to see them.&nbsp; You can



<P>dress for both, and be as elegant as you please.&nbsp; It pays for



<P>you to be fine.&nbsp; It doesn't for me, and furbelows only worry me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, dear!" sighed Amy, "now she's in a contrary fit, and



<P>will drive me distracted before I can get her properly ready.



<P>I'm sure it's no pleasure to me to go today, but it's a debt we



<P>owe society, and there's no one to pay it but you and me.&nbsp; I'll



<P>do anything for you, Jo, if you'll only dress yourself nicely,



<P>and come and help me do the civil.&nbsp; You can talk so well, look



<P>so aristocratic in your best things, and behave so beautifully,



<P>if you try, that I'm proud of you.&nbsp; I'm afraid to go alone, do



<P>come and take care of me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You're an artful little puss to flatter and wheedle your



<P>cross old sister in that way.&nbsp; The idea of my being aristocratic



<P>and well-bred, and your being afraid to go anywhere alone!&nbsp; I



<P>don't know which is the most absurd.&nbsp; Well, I'll go if I must,



<P>and do my best.&nbsp; You shall be commander of the expedition, and



<P>I'll obey blindly, will that satisfy you?" said Jo, with a sudden



<P>change from perversity to lamblike submission.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You're a perfect cherub!&nbsp; Now put on all your best things,



<P>and I'll tell you how to behave at each place, so that you will



<P>make a good impression.&nbsp; I want people to like you, and they



<P>would if you'd only try to be a little more agreeable.&nbsp; Do your



<P>hair the pretty way, and put the pink rose in your bonnet.&nbsp; It's



<P>becoming, and you look too sober in your plain suit.&nbsp; Take your



<P>light gloves and the embroidered handkerchief.&nbsp; We'll stop at



<P>Meg's, and borrow her white sunshade, and then you can have my



<P>dove-colored one."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While Amy dressed, she issued her orders, and Jo obeyed



<P>them, not without entering her protest, however, for she sighed



<P>as she rustled into her new organdie, frowned darkly at herself



<P>as she tied her bonnet strings in an irreproachable bow,



<P>wrestled viciously with pins as she put on her collar,



<P>wrinkled up her features generally as she shook out the handkerchief,



<P>whose embroidery was as irritating to her nose as the present mission



<P>was to her feelings, and when she had squeezed her hands into



<P>tight gloves with three buttons and a tassel, as the last touch



<P>of elegance, she turned to Amy with an imbecile expression of



<P>countenance, saying meekly...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm perfectly miserable, but if you consider me presentable,



<P>I die happy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You're highly satisfactory.&nbsp; turn slowly round, and let me



<P>get a careful view."&nbsp; Jo revolved, and Amy gave a touch here and



<P>there, then fell back, with her head on one side, observing graciously,



<P>"Yes, you'll do.&nbsp; Your head is all I could ask, for that



<P>white bonnet with the rose is quite ravishing.&nbsp; Hold back your



<P>shoulders, and carry your hands easily, no matter if your gloves



<P>do pinch.&nbsp; There's one thing you can do well, Jo, that is, wear

a



<P>shawl.&nbsp; I can't, but it's very nice to see you, and I'm so glad



<P>Aunt March gave you that lovely one.&nbsp; It's simple, but handsome,



<P>and those folds over the arm are really artistic.&nbsp; Is the point

of



<P>my mantle in the middle, and have I looped my dress evenly?&nbsp; I

like



<P>to show my boots, for my feet are pretty, though my nose isn't."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are a thing of beauty and a joy forever," said Jo, looking



<P>through her hand with the air of a connoisseur at the blue feather



<P>against the golden hair.&nbsp; "Am I to drag my best dress through the



<P>dust, or loop it up, please, ma'am?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hold it yup when you walk, but drop it in the house.&nbsp; The



<P>sweeping style suits you best, and you must learn to trail your



<P>skirts gracefully.&nbsp; You haven't half buttoned one cuff, do it at



<P>once.&nbsp; You'll never look finished if you are not careful about

the



<P>little details, for they make yup the pleasing whole."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo sighed, and proceeded to burst the buttons off her glove,



<P>in doing up her cuff, but at last both were ready, and sailed away,



<P>looking as `pretty as picters', Hannah said, as she hung out of the



<P>upper window to watch them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now, Jo dear, the Chesters consider themselves very elegant



<P>people, so I want you to put on your best deportment.&nbsp; Don't make



<P>any of your abrupt remarks, or do anything odd, will you?&nbsp; Just

be



<P>calm, cool, and quiet, that's safe and ladylike, and you can easily



<P>do it for fifteen minutes," said Amy, as they approached the first



<P>place, having borrowed the white parasol and been inspected by Meg,



<P>with a baby on each arm.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Let me see.&nbsp; `Calm, cool, and quiet', yes, I think I can



<P>promise that.&nbsp; I've played the part of a prim young lady on the



<P>stage, and I'll try it off.&nbsp; My powers are great, as you shall

see,



<P>so be easy in your mind, my child."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy looked relieved, but naughty Jo took her at her word, for



<P>during the first call she sat with every limb gracefully composed,



<P>every fold correctly draped, calm as a summer sea, cool as a snowbank,



<P>and as silent as the sphinx.&nbsp; In vain Mrs. Chester alluded to



<P>her `charming novel', and the Misses Chester introduced parties,



<P>picnics, the opera, and the fashions.&nbsp; Each and all were answered



<P>by a smile, a bow, and a demure "Yes" or "No" with the chill on.



<P>In vain Amy telegraphed the word `talk', tried to draw her out, and



<P>administered covert pokes with her foot.&nbsp; Jo sat as if blandly

unconcious



<P>of it all, with deportment like Maud's face, `icily regular, splendidly

null'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What a haughty, uninteresting creature that oldest Miss March is!"



<P>was the unfortunately audible remark of one of the ladies, as



<P>the door closed upon their guests.&nbsp; Jo laughed noiselessly all



<P>through the hall, but Amy looked disgusted at the failure of her



<P>instructions, and very naturally laid the blame upon Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How could you mistake me so?&nbsp; I merely meant you to be properly



<P>dignified and composed, and you made yourself a perfect stock and



<P>stone.&nbsp; Try to be sociable at the Lamb's'.&nbsp; Gossip as other

girls do,



<P>and be interested in dress and flirtations and whatever nonsense



<P>comes up.&nbsp; They move in the best society, are valuable persons

for



<P>us to know, and I wouldn't fail to make a good impression there for



<P>anything."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll be agreeable.&nbsp; I'll gossip and giggle, and have horrors



<P>and raptures over any trifle you like.&nbsp; I rather enjoy this, and



<P>now I'll imitate what is called `a charming girl'.&nbsp; I can do it,



<P>for I have May Chester as a model, and I'll improve upon her.&nbsp;

See if



<P>the Lambs don't say, `What a lively, nice creature that Jo March is!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy felt anxious, as well she might, for when Jo turned freakish



<P>there was no knowing where she would stop.&nbsp; Amy's face was a



<P>study when she saw her sister skim into the next drawing room, kiss



<P>all the young ladies with effusion, beam graciously upon the young



<P>gentlemen, and join in the chat with a spirit which amazed the beholder.



<P>Amy was taken possession of by Mrs. Lamb, with whom she



<P>was a favorite, and forced to hear a long account of Lucretia's



<P>last attack, while three delightful young gentlemen hovered near,



<P>waiting for a pause when they might rush in and rescue her.&nbsp; So



<P>situated, she was powerless to check Jo, who seemed possessed by



<P>a spirit of mischief, and talked away as volubly as the lady.&nbsp;

A



<P>knot of heads gathered about her, and Amy strained her ears to hear



<P>what was going on, for broken sentences filled her with curiosity,



<P>and frequent peals of laughter made her wild to share the fun.&nbsp;

One



<P>may imagine her suffering on overhearing fragments of this sort of



<P>conversation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She rides splendidly.&nbsp; who taught her?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No one.&nbsp; She used to practice mounting, holding the reins, and



<P>sitting straight on an old saddle in a tree.&nbsp; Now she rides anything,



<P>for she doesn't know what fear is, and the stableman lets her have



<P>horses cheap because she trains them to carry ladies so well.&nbsp;

She



<P>has such a passion for it, I often tell her if everything else fails,



<P>she can be a horsebreaker, and get her living so."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At this awful speech Amy contained herself with difficulty, for



<P>the impression was being given that she was rather a fast young lady,



<P>which was her especial aversion.&nbsp; But what could she do?&nbsp;

For the



<P>old lady was in the middle of her story, and long before it was done,



<P>Jo was off again, make more droll revelations and committing still



<P>more fearful blunders.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, Amy was in despair that day, for all the good beasts were



<P>gone, and of three left, one was lame, one blind, and the other so



<P>balky that you had to put dirt in his mouth before he would start.



<P>Nice animal for a pleasure party, wasn't it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Which did she choose?" asked one of the laughing gentlemen,



<P>who enjoyed the subject.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"None of them.&nbsp; She heard of a young horse at the farm house



<P>over the river, and though a lady had never ridden him, she resolved



<P>to try, because he was handsome and spirited.&nbsp; Her struggles



<P>were really pathetic.&nbsp; There was no one to bring the horse to the



<P>saddle, so she took the saddle to the horse.&nbsp; My dear creature,

she



<P>actually rowed it over the river, put it on her head, and marched



<P>up to the barn to the utter amazement of the old man!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Did she ride the horse?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Of course she did, and had a capital time.&nbsp; I expected to see



<P>her brought home in fragments, but she managed him perfectly, and



<P>was the life of the party."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I call that plucky!"&nbsp; And young Mr. Lamb turned an approving



<P>glance upon Amy, wondering what his mother could be saying to make



<P>the girl look so red and uncomfortable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was still redder and more uncomfortable a moment after,



<P>when a sudden turn in the conversation introduced the subject of



<P>dress.&nbsp; One of the young ladies asked Jo where she got the pretty



<P>drab hat she wore to the picnic and stupid Jo, instead of mentioning



<P>the place where it was bought two years ago, must needs answer



<P>with unnecessary frankness, "Oh, Amy painted it.&nbsp; You can't buy



<P>those soft shades, so we paint ours any color we like.&nbsp; It's a

great



<P>comfort to have an artistic sister."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Isn't that an original idea?" cried Miss Lamb, who found Jo great fun.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's nothing compared to some of her brilliant performances.



<P>There's nothing the child can't do.&nbsp; Why, she wanted a pair of

blue



<P>boots for Sallie's party, so she just painted her soiled white ones



<P>the loveliest shade of sky blue you ever saw, and they looked exactly



<P>like satin," added Jo, with an air of pride in her sister's accomplishments



<P>that exasperated Amy till she felt that it would be a relief to throw

her



<P>cardcase at her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We read a story of yours the other day, and enjoyed it very much,"



<P>observed the elder Miss Lamb, wishing to compliment the literary



<P>lady, who did not look the character just then, it must be confessed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Any mention of her `works' always had a bad effect upon Jo,



<P>who either grew rigid and looked offended, or changed the subject



<P>with a brusque remark, as now.&nbsp; "Sorry you could find nothing better



<P>to read.&nbsp; I write that rubbish because it sells, and ordinary people



<P>like it.&nbsp; Are you going to New York this winter?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As Miss Lamb had `enjoyed' the story, this speech was not



<P>exactly grateful or complimentary.&nbsp; The minute it was made Jo saw



<P>her mistake, but fearing to make the matter worse, suddenly remembered



<P>that it was for her to make the first move toward departure,



<P>and did so with an abruptness that left three people with half-



<P>finished sentences in their mouths.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Amy, we must go.&nbsp; Good-by, dear, do come and see us.&nbsp; We

are



<P>pining for a visit.&nbsp; I don't dare to ask you, Mr. Lamb, but if

you



<P>should come, I don't think I shall have the heart to send you away."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo said this with such a droll imitation of May Chester's



<P>gushing style that Amy got out of the room as rapidly as possible,



<P>feeling a strong desire to laugh and cry at the same time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Didn't I do well?" asked Jo, with a satisfied air as they walked away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nothing could have been worse," was Amy's crushing reply.



<P>"What possessed you to tell those stories about my saddle, and



<P>the hats and boots, and all the rest of it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, it's funny, and amuses people.&nbsp; They know we are poor,



<P>so it's no use pretending that we have grooms, buy three or



<P>four hats a season, and have things as easy and fine as they do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You needn't go and tell them all our little shifts, and



<P>expose our; poverty in that perfectly unnecessary way.&nbsp; You haven't



<P>a bit of proper pride, and never will learn when to hold your



<P>tongue and when to speak," said Amy despairingly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Poor Jo looked abashed, and silently chafed the end of her



<P>nose with the stiff handkerchief, as if performing a penance for



<P>her misdemeanors.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How shall I behave here?" she asked, as they approached the



<P>third mansion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Just as you please.&nbsp; I wash my hands of you," was Amy's short



<P>answer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then I'll enjoy myself.&nbsp; The boys are at home, and we'll have



<P>a comfortable time.&nbsp; Goodness knows I need a little change, for



<P>elegance has a bad effect upon my constitution," returned Jo gruffly,



<P>being disturbed by her failure to suit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>An enthusiastic welcome from three big boys and several pretty



<P>children speedily soothed her ruffled feelings, and leaving Amy to



<P>entertain the hostess and Mr. Tudor, who happened to be calling



<P>likewise, Jo devoted herself to the young folks and found the



<P>change refreshing.&nbsp; She listened to college stories with deep interest,



<P>caressed pointers and poodles without a murmur, agreed heartily



<P>that "Tom Brown was a brick," regardless of the improper form



<P>of praise, and when one lad proposed a visit to his turtle tank,



<P>she went with an alacrity which caused Mamma to smile upon her,



<P>as that motherly lady settled the cap which was left in a ruinous



<P>condition by filial hugs, bearlike but affectionate, and dearer to



<P>her than the most faultless coiffure from the hands of an inspired



<P>Frenchwoman.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Leaving her sister to her own devices, Amy proceeded to enjoy



<P>herself to her heart's content.&nbsp; Mr. Tudor's uncle had married

an



<P>English lady who was third cousin to a living lord, and Amy regarded



<P>the whole family with great respect, for in spite of her American



<P>birth and breeding, she possessed that reverence for titles which



<P>haunts the best of us--that unacknowledged loyalty to the early



<P>faith in kings which set the most democratic nation under the sun



<P>in ferment at the coming of a royal yellow-haired laddie, some years



<P>ago, and which still has something to do with the love the young



<P>country bears the old, like that of a big son for an imperious little



<P>mother, who held him while she could, and let him go with a farewell



<P>scolding when he rebelled.&nbsp; But even the satisfaction of talking

with



<P>a distant connection of the British nobility did not render Amy forgetful



<P>of time, and when the proper number of minutes had passed, she



<P>reluctantly tore herself from this aristocratic society, and looked



<P>about for Jo, fervently hoping that her incorrigible sister would not



<P>be found in any position which should bring disgrace upon the name of

March.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It might have been worse, but Amy considered it bad.&nbsp; For Jo



<P>sat on the grass, with an encampment of boys about her, and a



<P>dirty-footed dog reposing on the skirt of her state and festival dress,



<P>as she related one of Laurie's pranks to her admiring audience.&nbsp;

One



<P>small child was poking turtles with Amy's cherished parasol, a second



<P>was eating gingerbread over Jo's best bonnet, and a third playing



<P>ball with her gloves.&nbsp; but all were enjoying themselves, and when

Jo



<P>collected her damaged property to go, her escort accompanied her,



<P>begging her to come again, "It was such fun to hear about Laurie's larks."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Capital boys, aren't they?&nbsp; I feel quite young and brisk again



<P>after that." said Jo, strolling along with her hands behind her,



<P>partly from habit, partly to conceal the bespattered parasol.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why do you always avoid Mr. Tudor?" asked Amy, wisely refraining



<P>from any comment upon Jo's dilapidated appearance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't like him, he puts on airs, snubs his sisters, worries



<P>his father, a nd doesn't speak respectfully of his mother.&nbsp; Laurie



<P>says he is fast, and I don't consider him a desirable acquaintance,



<P>so I let him alone."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You might treat him civilly, at least.&nbsp; You gave him a cool



<P>nod, and just now you bowed and smiled in the politest way to



<P>Tommy Chamberlain, whose father keeps a grocery store.&nbsp; If you



<P>had just reversed the nod and the bow, it would have been right,"



<P>said Amy reprovingly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, it wouldn't," returned Jo, "I neither like, respect, nor



<P>admire Tudor, though his grandfather's uncle's nephew's niece was



<P>a third cousin to a lord.&nbsp; Tommy is poor and bashful and good and



<P>very clever.&nbsp; I think well of him, and like to show that I do,

for



<P>he is a gentleman in spite of the brown paper parcels."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's no use trying to argue with you," began Amy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not the least, my dear," interrupted Jo, "so let us look



<P>amiable, and drop a card here, as the Kings are evidently out,



<P>for which I'm deeply grateful."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The family cardcase having done its duty the girls walked



<P>on, and Jo uttered another thanksgiving on reaching the fifth



<P>house, and being told that the young ladies were engaged.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"now let us go home, and never mind Aunt March today.&nbsp; We



<P>can run down there any time, and it's really a pity to trail



<P>through the dust in our best bibs and tuckers, when we are



<P>tired and cross."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Speak for yourself, if you please.&nbsp; Aunt March likes to have us



<P>pay her the compliment of coming in style, and making a formal call.



<P>It's a little thing to do, but it gives her pleasure, and I don't



<P>believe it will hurt your things half so much as letting dirty dogs



<P>and clumping boys spoil them.&nbsp; Stoop down, and let me take the



<P>crumbs off of your bonnet."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What a good girl you are, Amy!" said Jo, with a repentant



<P>glance from her own damaged costume to that of her sister, which



<P>was fresh and spotless still.&nbsp; "I wish it was as easy for me to

do



<P>little things to please people as it is for you.&nbsp; I think of them,



<P>but it takes too much time to do them, so I wait for a chance to



<P>confer a great favor, and let the small ones slip, but they tell



<P>best in the end, I fancy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy smiled and was mollified at once, saying with a maternal



<P>air, "Women should learn to be agreeable, particularly poor ones,



<P>for they have no other way of repaying the kindnesses they receive.



<P>If you'd remember that, and practice it, you'd be better liked



<P>than I am, because there is more of you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm a crotchety old thing, and always shall be, but I'm



<P>willing to own that you are right, only it's easier for me to



<P>risk my life for a person than to be pleasant to him when I don't



<P>feel like it.&nbsp; It's a great misfortune to have such strong likes



<P>and dislikes, isn't it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's a greater not to be able to hide them.&nbsp; I don't mind



<P>saying that I don't approve of Tudor any more than you do, but I'm



<P>not called upon to tell him so.&nbsp; Neither are you, and there is

no



<P>use in making yourself disagreeable because he is."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But I think girls ought to show when they disapprove of



<P>young men, and how can they do it except by their manners?



<P>Preaching does not do any good, as I know to my sorrow, since I've



<P>had Teddie to manage.&nbsp; But there are many little ways in which

I can



<P>influence him without a word, and I say we ought to do it to others



<P>if we can."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Teddy is a remarkable boy, and can't be taken as a sample



<P>of other boys," said Amy, in a tone of solemn conviction, which



<P>would have convulsed the `remarkable boy' if he had heard it.&nbsp;

"If



<P>we were belles, or women of wealth and position, we might do something,



<P>perhaps, but for us to frown at one set of young gentlemen because



<P>we don't approve of them, and smile upon another set because



<P>we do, wouldn't have a particle of effect, and we should



<P>only be considered odd and puritanical."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So we are to countenance things and people which we detest,



<P>merely because we are not belles and millionaires, are we?



<P>That's a nice sort of morality."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I can't argue about it, I only know that it's the way of



<P>the world, and people who set themselves against it only get



<P>laughed at for their pains.&nbsp; I don't like reformers, and I hope



<P>you never try to be one."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do like them, and I shall be one if I can, for in spite of



<P>the laughing the world would never get on without them.&nbsp; We can't



<P>agree about that.&nbsp; for you belong to the old set, and I to the

new.



<P>You will get on the best, but I shall have the liveliest time of it.



<P>I should rather enjoy the brickbats and hooting, I think."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, compose yourself now, and don't worry Aunt with your



<P>new ideas."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll try not to, but I'm always possessed to burst out with



<P>some particularly blunt speech or revolutionary sentiment before



<P>her.&nbsp; It's my doom, and I can't help it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They found Aunt Carrol with the old lady, both absorbed in



<P>some very interesting subject, but they dropped it as the girls



<P>came in, with a conscious look which betrayed that they had been



<P>talking about their nieces.&nbsp; Jo was not in a good humor, and the



<P>perverse fit returned, but Amy, who had virtuously done her duty,



<P>kept her temper and pleased everybody, was in a most angelic frame



<P>of mind.&nbsp; This amiable spirit was felt at once, and both aunts

`my



<P>deared' her affectionately, looking what they afterward said emphatically,



<P>"That child improves every day."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Are you going to help about the fair, dear?" asked Mrs. Carrol,



<P>as Amy sat down beside her with the confiding air elderly people like



<P>so well in the young.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, Aunt.&nbsp; Mrs. Chester asked me if I would, and I offered to



<P>tend a table, as I have nothing but my time to give."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm not," put in Jo decidedly.&nbsp; "I hate to be patronized, and



<P>the Chesters think it's a great favor to allow us to help with their



<P>highly connected fair.&nbsp; I wonder you consented, Amy, they only

want



<P>you to work."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am willing to work.&nbsp; It's for the freedmen as well as the



<P>Chesters, and I think it very kind of them to let me share the



<P>labor and the fun.&nbsp; Patronage does not trouble me when it is well



<P>meant."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Quite right and proper.&nbsp; I like your grateful spirit, my dear.



<P>It's a pleasure to help people who appreciate our efforts.&nbsp; Some

do



<P>not, and that is trying," observed Aunt March, looking over her



<P>spectacles at Jo, who sat apart, rocking herself, with a somewhat



<P>morose expression.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If Jo had only known what a great happiness was wavering in



<P>the balance for one of them, she would have turned dove-like in a



<P>minute, but unfortunately, we don't have windows in our breasts,



<P>and cannot see what goes on in the minds of our friends.&nbsp; Better



<P>for us that we cannot as a general thing, but now and then it



<P>would be such a comfort, such a saving of time and temper.&nbsp; By

her



<P>next speech, Jo deprived herself of several years of pleasure, and



<P>received a timely lesson in the art of holding her tongue.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't like favors, they oppress and make me feel like a



<P>slave.&nbsp; I'd rather do everything for myself, and be perfectly



<P>independent."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ahem!" coughed Aunt Carrol softly, with a look at Aunt March.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I told you so," said Aunt March, with a decided nod to Aunt Carrol.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mercifully unconscious of what she had done, Jo sat with her nose in



<P>the air, and a revolutionary aspect which was anything but inviting.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you speak French, dear?" asked Mrs. Carrol, laying a hand on Amy's.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Pretty well, thanks to Aunt March, who lets Esther talk to



<P>me as often as I like," replied amy, with a grateful look, which



<P>caused the old lady to smile affably.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How are you about languages?" asked Mrs. Carrol of JO.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't know a word.&nbsp; I'm very stupid about studying anything,



<P>can't bear French, it's such a slippery, silly sort of language,"



<P>was the brusque reply.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Another look passed between the ladies, and Aunt March said



<P>to Amy, 'You are quite strong and well no, dear, I believe?&nbsp; Eyes



<P>don't trouble you any more, do they?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not at all, thank you, ma'am.&nbsp; I'm very well, and mean to do



<P>great things next winter, so that I may be ready for Rome, whenever



<P>that joyful time arrives."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Good girl!&nbsp; You deserve to go, and I'm sure you will some



<P>day," said Aunt March, with an approving; pat on the head, as Amy



<P>picked up her ball for her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Crosspatch, draw the latch,



<P>Sit by the fire and spin,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>squalled Polly, bending down from his perch on the back of her



<P>chair to peep into Jo's face, with such a comical air of impertinent



<P>inquiry that it was impossible to help laughing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Most observing bird," said the old lady.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Come and take a walk, my dear?" cried Polly, hopping toward



<P>the china closet, with a look suggestive of a lump of sugar.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you, I will.&nbsp; Come Amy."&nbsp; And Jo brought the visit

to



<P>an end, feeling more strongly than ever that calls did have a bad



<P>effect upon her constitution.&nbsp; She shook hands in a gentlemanly



<P>manner, but Amy kissed both the aunts, and the girls departed,



<P>leaving behind them the impression of shadow and sunshine, which



<P>impression caused Aunt March to say, as they vanished...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You'd better do it, Mary.&nbsp; I'll supply the money.&nbsp; And Aunt



<P>Carrol to reply decidedly, "I certainly will, if her father and



<P>mother consent."

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Like most other young matrons, Meg began her married life



<P>with the determination to be a model housekeeper.&nbsp; John should



<P>find home a paradise, he should always see a smiling face,



<P>should fare sumptuously every day, and never know the loss of



<P>a button.&nbsp; She brought so much love, energy, and cheerfulness



<P>to the work that she could not but succeed, in spite of some



<P>obstacles.&nbsp; Her paradise was not a tranquil one, for the little



<P>woman fussed, was over-anxious to please, and bustled about like



<P>a true Martha, cumbered with many cares.&nbsp; She was too tired, sometimes,



<P>even to smile, John grew dyspeptic after a course of dainty



<P>dishes and ungratefully demanded plain fare.&nbsp; As for buttons,



<P>she soon learned to wonder where they went, to shake her head over



<P>the carelessness of men, and to threaten to make him sew them



<P>on himself, and see if his work would stand impatient and clumsy



<P>fingers any better than hers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They were very happy, even after they discovered that they



<P>couldn't live on love alone.&nbsp; John did not find Meg's beauty diminished,



<P>though she beamed at him from behind the familiar coffee pot.



<P>Nor did Meg miss any of the romance from the daily parting, when her



<P>husband followed up his kiss with the tender inquiry, "Shall I send



<P>some veal or mutton for dinner, darling?" The little house ceased



<P>to be a glorified bower, but it became a home, and the young couple



<P>soon felt that it was a change for the better.&nbsp; At first they played



<P>keep-house, and frolicked over it like children.&nbsp; Then John took



<P>steadily to business, feeling the cares of the head of a family upon



<P>his shoulders, and Meg laid by her cambric wrappers, put on a big apron,



<P>and fell to work, as before said, with more energy than discretion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While the cooking mania lasted she went through Mrs. Cornelius's



<P>Receipt Book as if it were a mathematical exercise, working out the



<P>problems with patience and care.&nbsp; Sometimes her family were invited



<P>in to help eat up a too bounteous feast of successes, or Lotty would



<P>be privately dispatched with a batch of failures, which were to be



<P>concealed from all eyes in the convenient stomachs of the little



<P>Hummels.&nbsp; An evening with John over the account books usually produced



<P>a temporary lull in the culinary enthusiasm, and a frugal fit



<P>would ensue, during which the poor man was put through a course of



<P>bread pudding, hash, and warmed-over coffee, which tried his soul,



<P>although he bore it with praiseworthy fortitude.&nbsp; Before the golden



<P>mean was found, however, Meg added to her domestic possessions what



<P>young couples seldom get on long without, a family jar.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fired a with housewifely wish to see her storeroom stocked with



<P>homemade preserves, she undertook to put up her own currant jelly.



<P>John was requested to order home a dozen or so of little pots and an



<P>extra quantity of sugar, for their own currants were ripe and were



<P>to be attended to at once.&nbsp; As John firmly believed that `my wife'



<P>was equal to anything, and took a natural pride in her skill, he



<P>resolved that she should be gratified, and their only crop of fruit



<P>laid by in a most pleasing form for winter use.&nbsp; Home came four



<P>dozen delightful little pots, half a barrel of sugar, and a small



<P>boy to pick the currants for her.&nbsp; With her pretty hair tucked

into



<P>a little cap, arms bared to the elbow, and a checked apron which



<P>had a coquettish look in spite of the bib, the young housewife fell



<P>to work, feeling no doubts about her success, for hadn't she seen



<P>Hannah do it hundreds of times?&nbsp; The array of pots rather amazed

her



<P>at first, but John was so fond of jelly, and the nice little jars



<P>would look so well on the top shelf, that Meg resolved to fill them



<P>all, and spend a long day picking, boiling, straining, and fussing



<P>over her jelly.&nbsp; She did her best, she asked advice of Mrs. Cornelius,



<P>she racked her brain to remember what Hannah did that she left



<P>undone, she reboiled, resugared, and restrained, but that dreadful



<P>stuff wouldn't `jell'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She longed to run home, bib and all, and ask Mother to lend her



<P>a hand, but John and she had agreed that they would never annoy anyone



<P>with their private worries, experiments, or quarrels.&nbsp; They had



<P>laughed over that last word as if the idea it suggested was a most



<P>preposterous one, but they had held to their resolve, and whenever



<P>they could get on without help they did so, and no one interfered,



<P>for Mrs. March had advised the plan.&nbsp; So Meg wrestled alone with

the



<P>refractory sweetmeats all that hot summer day, and at five o'clock



<P>sat down in her topsy-turvey kitchen, wrung her bedaubed hands,



<P>lifted up her voice and wept.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, in the first flush of the new life, she had often said,



<P>"My husband shall always feel free to bring a friend home whenever



<P>he likes.&nbsp; I shall always be prepared.&nbsp; There shall be no

flurry, no



<P>scolding, no discomfort, but a neat house, a cheerful wife, and a



<P>good dinner.&nbsp; John, dear, never stop to ask my leave, invite whom



<P>you please, and be sure of a welcome from me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>How charming that was, to be sure!&nbsp; John quite glowed with



<P>pride to hear her say it, and felt what a blessed thing it was to



<P>have a superior wife.&nbsp; But, although they had had company from

time



<P>to time, it never happened to be unexpected, and Meg had never had



<P>an opportunity to distinguish herself till now.&nbsp; It always happens



<P>so in this vale of tears, there is an inevitability about such things



<P>which we can only wonder at, deplore, and bear as we best can.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If John had not forgotten all about the jelly, it really would



<P>have been unpardonable in him to choose that day, of all the days in



<P>the year, to bring a friend home to dinner unexpectedly.&nbsp; Congratulating



<P>himself that a handsome repast had been ordered that morning,



<P>feeling sure that it would be ready to the minute, and indulging in



<P>pleasant anticipations of the charming effect it would produce, when



<P>his pretty wife came running out to meet him, he escorted his friend



<P>to his mansion, with the irrepressible satisfaction of a young host

and husband.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It is a world of disappointments, as John discovered when he



<P>reached the Dovecote.&nbsp; the front door usually stood hospitably

open.



<P>Now it was not only shut, but locked, and yesterday's mud still



<P>adorned the steps.&nbsp; The parlor windows were closed and curtained,



<P>no picture of the pretty wife sewing on the piazza, in white, with



<P>a distracting little bow in her hair, or a bright-eyed hostess,



<P>smiling a shy welcome as she greeted her guest.&nbsp; Nothing of the

sort,



<P>for not a soul appeared but a sanginary-looking boy asleep under the



<P>current bushes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm afraid something has happened.&nbsp; Step into the garden, Scott,



<P>while I look up Mrs. Brooke," said John, alarmed at the silence and



<P>solitude.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Round the house he hurried, led by a pungent smell of burned



<P>sugar, and Mr. Scott strolled after him, with a queer look on his



<P>face.&nbsp; He paused discreetly at a distance when Brooke disappeared,



<P>but he could both see and hear, and being a bachelor, enjoyed the



<P>prospect mightily.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the kitchen reigned confusion and despair.&nbsp; One edition of



<P>jelly was trickled from pot to pot, another lay upon the floor,



<P>and a third was burning gaily on the stove.&nbsp; Lotty, with Teutonic



<P>phlegm, was calmly eating bread and currant wine, for the jelly was



<P>still in a hopelessly liquid state, while Mrs. Brooke, with her apron



<P>over her head, sat sobbing dismally.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dearest girl, what is the matter?" cried John, rushing in,



<P>with awful visions of scalded hands, sudden news of affliction, and



<P>secret consternation at the thought of the guest in the garden.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, John, I am so tired and hot and cross and worried!&nbsp; I've



<P>been at it till I'm all worn out.&nbsp; Do come and help me or I shall



<P>die!" And the exhausted housewife cast herself upon his breast,



<P>giving him a sweet welcome in every sense of the word, for her



<P>pinafore had been baptized at the same time as the floor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What worries you dear?&nbsp; Has anything dreadful happened?"



<P>asked the anxious John, tenderly kissing the crown of the little



<P>cap, which was all askew.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," sobbed Meg despairingly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Tell me quick, then.&nbsp; Don't cry.&nbsp; I can bear anything better



<P>than that.&nbsp; Out with it, love."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The...The jelly won't jell and I don't know what to do!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>John Brooke laughed then as he never dared to laugh afterward,



<P>and the derisive Scott smiled involuntarily as he heard the hearty



<P>peal, which put the finishing stroke to poor Meg's woe.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Is that all?&nbsp; Fling it out of the window, and don't bother any



<P>more about it.&nbsp; I'll buy you quarts if you want it, but for heaven's



<P>sake don't have hysterics, for I've brought Jack Scott home to dinner,



<P>and..."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>John got no further, for Meg cast him off, and clasped her hands



<P>with a tragic gesture as she fell into a chair, exclaiming in a tone



<P>of mingled indignation, reproach, and dismay...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A man to dinner, and everything in a mess!&nbsp; John Brooke, how



<P>could you do such a thing?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hush, he's in the garden!&nbsp; I forgot the confounded jelly, but



<P>it can't be helped now," said John, surveying the prospect with an



<P>anxious eye.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You ought to have sent word, or told me this morning, and you



<P>ought to have remembered how busy I was," continued Meg petulantly,



<P>for even turtledoves will peck when ruffled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I didn't know it this morning, and there was no time to send



<P>word, for I met him on the way out.&nbsp; I never thought of asking

leave,



<P>when you have always told me to do as I liked.&nbsp; I never tried it

before,



<P>and hang me if I ever do again!" added John, with an aggrieved air.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I should hope not!&nbsp; Take him away at once.&nbsp; I can't see him,



<P>and there isn't any dinner."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I like that!&nbsp; Where's the beef and vegetables I sent



<P>home, and the pudding you promised?" cried John, rushing to the



<P>larder.



<P>"I hadn't time to cook anything.&nbsp; I meant to dine at Mother's.



<P>I'm sorry, but I was so busy," and Meg's tears began again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>John was a mild man, but he was human, and after a long day's



<P>work to come home tired, hungry, and hopeful, to find a chaotic



<P>house, an empty table, and a cross wife was not exactly conductive



<P>to repose of mind or manner.&nbsp; He restrained himself however, and

the



<P>little squall would have blown over, but for one unlucky word.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's a scrape, I acknowledge, but if you will lend a hand,



<P>we'll pull through and have a good time yet.&nbsp; Don't cry, dear,

but



<P>just exert yourself a bit, and fix us up something to eat.&nbsp; We're



<P>both as hungry as hunters, so we shan't mind what it is.&nbsp; Give

us



<P>the cold meat, and bread and cheese.&nbsp; We won't ask for jelly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He meant it to be a good-natured joke, but that one word sealed



<P>his fate.&nbsp; Meg thought it was too cruel to hint about her sad failure,



<P>and the last atom of patience vanished as he spoke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You must get yourself out of the scrape as you can.&nbsp; I'm too



<P>used up to `exert' myself for anyone.&nbsp; It's like a man to propose



<P>a bone and vulgar bread and cheese for company.&nbsp; I won't have anything



<P>of the sort in my house.&nbsp; Take that Scott up to Mother's, and



<P>tell him I'm away, sick, dead, anything.&nbsp; I won't see him, and

you



<P>two can laugh at me and my jelly as much as you like.&nbsp; You won't



<P>have anything else here."&nbsp; And having delivered her defiance all



<P>on one breath, Meg cast away her pinafore and precipitately left the



<P>field to bemoan herself in her own room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>What those two creatures did in her absence, she never knew,



<P>but Mr. scott was not taken `up to Mother's', and when Meg descended,



<P>after they had strolled away together, she found traces of a promiscuous



<P>lunch which filled her with horror.&nbsp; Lotty reported that they had

eaten



<P>"a much, and greatly laughed, and the master bid her throw away all



<P>the sweet stuff, and hide the pots."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg longed to go and tell Mother, but a sense of shame at her own



<P>short comings, of loyalty to John, "who might be cruel, but nobody



<P>should know it," restrained her, and after a summary cleaning up,



<P>she dressed herself prettily, and sat down to wait for John to



<P>come and be forgiven.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Unfortunately, John didn't come, not seeing the matter in that



<P>light.&nbsp; He had carried it off as a good joke with Scott, excused

his



<P>little wife as well as he could, and played the host so hospitably



<P>that his friend enjoyed the impromptu dinner, and promised to come



<P>again, but John was angry, though he did not show it, he felt that



<P>Meg had deserted him in his hour of need.&nbsp; "It wasn't fair to tell



<P>a man to bring folks home any time, with perfect freedom, and when



<P>he took you at your word, to flame up and blame him, and leave him



<P>in the lurch, to be laughed at or pitied.&nbsp; No, by George, it wasn't!



<P>And Meg must know it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had fumed inwardly during the feast, but when the flurry was



<P>over and he strolled home after seeing Scott off, a milder mood came



<P>over him.&nbsp; "Poor little thing!&nbsp; It was hard upon her when

she tried so



<P>heartily to please me.&nbsp; She was wrong, of course, but then she

was



<P>young.&nbsp; I must be patient and teach her."&nbsp; He hoped she had

not gone



<P>home--he hated gossip and interference.&nbsp; For a minute he was ruffled



<P>again at the mere thought of it, and then the fear that Meg would cry



<P>herself sick softened his heart, and sent him on at a quicker pace,



<P>resolving to be calm and kind, but firm, quite firm, and show her



<P>where she had failed in her duty to her spouse.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg likewise resolved to be `calm and kind, but firm', and show



<P>him his duty.&nbsp; She longed to run to meet him, and beg pardon, and

be



<P>kissed and comforted, as she was sure of being, but, of course, she



<P>did nothing of the sort, and when she saw John coming, began to hum



<P>quite naturally, as she rocked and sewed, like a lady of leisure in



<P>her best parlor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>John was a little disappointed not to find a tender Niobe, but



<P>feeling that his dignity demanded the first apology, he made none,



<P>only came leisurely in and laid himself upon the sofa with the singularly



<P>relevant remark, "We are going to have a new moon, my dear."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I've no objection," was Meg's equally soothing remark.&nbsp; A few



<P>other topics of general interest were introduced by Mr. Brooke and



<P>wet-blanketed by Mrs. Brooke, and conversation languished.&nbsp; John



<P>went to one window, unfolded his paper, and wrapped himself in it,



<P>figuratively speaking.&nbsp; Meg went to the other window, and sewed

as



<P>if new rosettes for slippers were among the necessaries of life.



<P>Neither spoke.&nbsp; Both looked quite `calm and firm', and both felt



<P>desperately uncomfortable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, dear," thought Meg, "married life is very trying, and



<P>does need infinite patience as well as love, as Mother says."&nbsp;

The



<P>word `Mother' suggested other maternal counsels given long ago, and



<P>received with unbelieving protests.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"John is a good man, but he has his faults, and you must learn



<P>to see and bear with them, remembering your own.&nbsp; He is very decided,



<P>but never will be obstinate, if you reason kindly, not oppose impatiently.



<P>He is very accurate, and particular about the truth--a good



<P>trait, though you call him `fussy'.&nbsp; Never deceive him by look

or



<P>word, Meg, and he will give you the confidence you deserve, the



<P>support you need.&nbsp; He has a temper, not like ours--one flash and

then



<P>all over--but the white, still anger that is seldom stirred, but



<P>once kindled is hard to quench.&nbsp; Be careful, be very careful, not

to



<P>wake his anger against yourself, for peace and happiness depend on



<P>keeping his respect.&nbsp; Watch yourself, be the first to ask pardon

if



<P>you both err, and guard against the little piques, misunderstandings,



<P>and hasty words that often pave the way for bitter sorrow and regret."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These words came back to Meg, as she sat sewing in the sunset,



<P>especially the last.&nbsp; This was the first serious disagreement,

her



<P>own hasty speeches sounded both silly and unkind, as she recalled



<P>them, her own anger looked childish now, and thoughts of poor John



<P>coming home to such a scene quite melted her heart.&nbsp; She glanced

at



<P>him with tears in her eyes, but he did not see them.&nbsp; She put down



<P>her work and got up, thinking, "I will be the first to say,



<P>`Forgive me', but he did not seem to hear her.&nbsp; She went very slowly



<P>across the room, for pride was hard to swallow, and stood by him,



<P>but he did not turn his head.&nbsp; For a minute she felt as if she



<P>really couldn't do it, then came the thought, This is the beginning.



<P>I'll do my part, and have nothing to reproach myself with,"



<P>and stooping sown, she softly kissed her husband on the forehead.



<P>Of course that settled it.&nbsp; The penitent kiss was better than a



<P>world of words, and John had her on his knee in a minute, saying



<P>tenderly...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It was too bad to laugh at the poor little jelly pots.



<P>Forgive me, dear.&nbsp; I never will again!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But he did, oh bless you, yes, hundreds of times, and so did



<P>Meg, both declaring that it was the sweetest jelly they ever made,



<P>for family peace was preserved in that little family jar.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After this, Meg had Mr. Scott to dinner by special invitation,



<P>and served him up a pleasant feast without a cooked wife for the



<P>first course, on which occasion she was so gay and gracious, and



<P>made everything go off so charmingly, that Mr. Scott told John he



<P>was a lucky fellow, and shook his head over the hardships of bachelorhood



<P>all the way home.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the autumn, new trials and experiences came to Meg.&nbsp; Sallie



<P>Moffat renewed her friendship, was always running out for a dish of



<P>gossip at the little house, or inviting `that poor dear' to come in



<P>and spend the day at the big house.&nbsp; It was pleasant, for in dull



<P>weather Meg often felt lonely.&nbsp; All were busy at home, John absent



<P>till night, and nothing to do but sew, or read, or potter about.&nbsp;

So



<P>it naturally fell out that Meg got into the way of gadding and gossiping



<P>with her friend.&nbsp; Seeing Sallie's pretty things made her long for



<P>such, and pity herself because she had not got them.&nbsp; Sallie was

very



<P>kind, and often offered her the coveted trifles, but Meg declined



<P>them, knowing that John wouldn't like it, and then this foolish little



<P>woman went and did what John disliked even worse.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She knew her husband's income, and she loved to feel that he



<P>trusted her, not only with his happiness, but what some men seem to



<P>value more--his money.&nbsp; She knew where it was, was free to take

what



<P>she liked, and all he asked was that she should keep account of every



<P>penny, pay bills once a month, and remember that she was a poor man's



<P>wife.&nbsp; Till now she had done well, been prudent and exact, kept

her



<P>little account books neatly, and showed them to him monthly without



<P>fear.&nbsp; But that autumn the serpent got into Meg's paradise, and

tempted



<P>her like many a modern Eve, not with apples, but with dress.&nbsp; Meg



<P>didn't like to be pitied and made to feel poor.&nbsp; It irritated her,



<P>but she was ashamed to confess it, and now and then she tried to console



<P>herself by buying something pretty, so that Sallie needn't think



<P>she had to economize.&nbsp; She always felt wicked after it, for the

pretty



<P>things were seldom necessaries, but then they cost so little, it wasn't



<P>worth worrying about, so the trifles increased unconsciously, and in



<P>the shopping excursions she was no longer a passive looker-on.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But the trifles cost more than one would imagine, and when she



<P>cast up her accounts at the end of the month the sum total rather



<P>scared her.&nbsp; John was busy that month and left the bills to her,

the



<P>next month he was absent, but the third he had a grand quarterly



<P>settling up, and Meg never forgot it.&nbsp; A few days before she had

done



<P>a dreadful thing, and it weighed upon her conscience.&nbsp; Sallie had



<P>been buying silks, and Meg longed for a new one, just a handsome light



<P>one for parties, her black silk was so common, and thin things for



<P>evening wear were only proper for girls.&nbsp; Aunt March usually gave

the



<P>sisters a present of twenty-five dollars apiece at New Year's.&nbsp;

That



<P>was only a month to wait, and here was a lovely violet silk going at



<P>a bargain, and she had the money, if she only dared to take it.&nbsp;

John



<P>always said what was his was hers, but would he think it right to



<P>spend not only the prospective five-and-twenty, but another



<P>five-and-twenty out of the household fund?&nbsp; That was the question.



<P>Sallie had urged her to do it, had offered to lend the money, and with



<P>the best intentions in life had tempted Meg beyond her strength.



<P>In an evil moment the shopman held up the lovely, shimmering folds,



<P>and said, "A bargain, I assure, you, ma'am." She answered, "I'll take



<P>it," and it was cut off and paid for, and Sallie had exulted, and she



<P>had laughed as if it were a thing of no consequence, and driven away,



<P>feeling as if she had stolen something, and the police were after her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When she got home, she tried to assuage the pangs of remorse



<P>by spreading forth the lovely silk, but it looked less silvery now,



<P>didn't become her, after all, and the words `fifty dollars' seemed



<P>stamped like a pattern down each breadth.&nbsp; She put it away, but

it



<P>haunted her, not delightfully as a new dress should, but dreadfully



<P>like the ghost of a folly that was not easily laid.&nbsp; When John

got



<P>out his books that night, Meg's heart sank, and for the first time



<P>in her married life, she was afraid of her husband.&nbsp; The kind,

brown



<P>eyes looked as if they could be stern, and though he was unusually



<P>merry, she fancied he had found her out, but didn't mean to let her



<P>know it.&nbsp; The house bills were all paid, the books all in order.



<P>John had praised her, and was undoing the old pocketbook which they



<P>called the `bank', when Meg, knowing that it was quite empty, stopped



<P>his hand, saying nervously...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You haven't seen my private expense book yet."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>John never asked to see it, but she always insisted on his doing



<P>so, and used to enjoy his masculine amazement at the queer things women



<P>wanted, and made him guess what piping was, demand fiercely the meaning



<P>of a hug-me-tight, or wonder how a little thing composed of three



<P>rosebuds, a bit of velvet, and a pair of strings, could possibly be



<P>a bonnet, and cost six dollars.&nbsp; That night he looked as if he

would



<P>like the fun of quizzing her figures and pretending to be horrified



<P>at her extravagance, as he often did, being particularly proud of



<P>his prudent wife.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The little book was brought slowly out and laid down before him.



<P>Meg got behind his chair under pretense of smoothing the wrinkles



<P>out of his tired forehead, and standing there, she said, with her



<P>panic increasing with every word .&nbsp; ..

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"John, dear, I'm ashamed to show you my book, for I've really



<P>been dreadfully extravagant lately.&nbsp; I go about so much I must

have



<P>things, you know, and Sallie advised my getting it, so I did, and



<P>my New Year's money will partly pay for it, but I was sorry after



<P>I had done it, for I knew you'd think it wrong in me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>John laughed, and drew her round beside him, saying goodhumoredly,



<P>"Don't go and hide.&nbsp; I won't beat you if you have got



<P>a pair of killing boots.&nbsp; I'm rather proud of my wife's feet, and



<P>don't mind if she does pay eight or nine dollars for her boots, if



<P>they are good ones."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That had been one of her last `trifles', and John's eye had



<P>fallen on it as he spoke.&nbsp; "Oh, what will he say when he comes

to



<P>that awful fifty dollars!" thought Meg, with a shiver.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's worse than boots, it's a silk dress," she said, with the



<P>calmness of desperation, for she wanted the worst over.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, dear, what is the `dem'd total', as Mr. Mantalini says?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That didn't sound like John, and she knew he was looking up at



<P>her with the straightforward look that she had always been ready to



<P>meet and answer with one as frank till now.&nbsp; She turned the page

and



<P>her head at the same time, pointing to the sum which would have been



<P>bad enough without the fifty, but which was appalling to her with



<P>that added.&nbsp; For a minute the room was very still, then John said



<P>slowly--but she could feel it cost him an effort to express no



<P>displeasure--. . .

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I don't know that fifty is much for a dress, with all the



<P>furbelows and notions you have to have to finish it off these days."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It isn't made or trimmed," sighed Meg, faintly, for a sudden



<P>recollection of the cost still to be incurred quite overwhelmed her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Twenty-five yards of silk seems a good deal to cover one small



<P>woman, but I've no doubt my wife will look as fine as Ned Moffat's



<P>when she gets it on," said John dryly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I know you are angry, John, but I can't help it.&nbsp; I don't mean



<P>to waste your money, and I didn't think those little things would



<P>count up so.&nbsp; I can't resist them when I see Sallie buying all

she



<P>wants, and pitying me because I don't.&nbsp; I try to be contented,

but



<P>it is hard, and I'm tired of being poor."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The last words were spoken so low she thought he did not hear



<P>them, but he did, and they wounded him deeply, for he had denied



<P>himself many pleasures for Meg's sake.&nbsp; She could have bitten her



<P>tongue out the minute she had said it, for John pushed the books



<P>away and got up, saying with a little quiver in his voice, "I was



<P>afraid of this.&nbsp; I do my best, Meg."&nbsp; If he had scolded her,

or



<P>even shaken her, it would not have broken her heart like those few



<P>words.&nbsp; She ran to him and held him close, crying, with repentant



<P>tears, "Oh, John, my dear, kind, hard-working boy.&nbsp; I didn't mean



<P>it!&nbsp; It was so wicked, so untrue and ungrateful, how could I say

it!



<P>Oh, how could I say it!"



<P>He was very kind, forgave her readily, and did not utter one



<P>reproach, but Meg knew that she had done and said a thing which



<P>would not be forgotten soon, although he might never allude to it



<P>again.&nbsp; She had promised to love him for better or worse, and then



<P>she, his wife, had reproached him with his poverty, after spending



<P>his earnings recklessly.&nbsp; It was dreadful, and the worst of it

was



<P>John went on so quietly afterward, just as if nothing had happened,



<P>except that he stayed in town later, and worked at night when she



<P>had gone to cry herself to sleep.&nbsp; A week or remorse nearly made



<P>Meg sick, and the discovery that John had countermanded the order



<P>for his new greatcoat reduced her to a state of despair which was



<P>pathetic to behold.&nbsp; He had simply said, in answer to her surprised



<P>inquiries as to the change, "I can't afford it, my dear."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg said no more, but a few minutes after he found her in the



<P>hall with her face buried in the old greatcoat, crying as if her



<P>heart would break.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They had a long talk that night, and Meg learned to love her



<P>husband better for his poverty, because it seemed to have made a



<P>man of him, given him the strength and courage to fight his own way,



<P>and taught him a tender patience with which to bear and comfort



<P>the natural longings and failures of those he loved.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Next day she put her pride in her pocket, went to Sallie, told



<P>the truth, and asked her to buy the silk as a favor.&nbsp; The good-



<P>natured Mrs. Moffat willingly did so, and had the delicacy not to



<P>make her a present of it immediately afterward.&nbsp; Then Meg ordered



<P>home the greatcoat, and when John arrived, she put it on, and asked



<P>him how he liked her new silk gown.&nbsp; One can imagine what answer

he



<P>made, how he received his present, and what a blissful state of



<P>things ensued.&nbsp; John came home early, Meg gadded no more, and that



<P>greatcoat was put on in the morning by a very happy husband, and



<P>taken off at night by a most devoted little wife.&nbsp; So the year



<P>rolled round, and at midsummer there came to Meg a new experience,



<P>the deepest and tenderest of a woman's life.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie came sneaking into the kitchen of the Dovecote one



<P>Saturday, with an excited face, and was received with the clash



<P>of cymbals, for Hannah clapped her hands with a saucepan in one



<P>and the cover in the other.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How's the little mamma?&nbsp; Where is everybody?&nbsp; Why didn't



<P>you tell me before I came home?" began Laurie in a loud whisper.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Happy as a queen, the dear!&nbsp; Every soul of `em is upstairs



<P>a worshipin'.&nbsp; We didn't want no hurrycanes round.&nbsp; Now you

go



<P>into the parlor, and I'll send `em down to you," with which



<P>somewhat involved reply Hannah vanished, chuckling ecstatically.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Presently Jo appeared, proudly bearing a flannel bundle laid



<P>forth upon a large pillow.&nbsp; Jo's face was very sober, but her eyes



<P>twinkled, and there was an odd sound in her voice of repressed



<P>emotion of some sort.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Shut your eyes and hold out your arms," she said invitingly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie backed precipitately into a corner, and put his hands



<P>behind him with an imploring gesture.&nbsp; "No, thank you.&nbsp; I'd

rather



<P>not.&nbsp; I shall drop it or smash it, as sure as fate."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then you shan't see your nevvy," said Jo decidedly, turning



<P>as if to go.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I will, I will!&nbsp; Only you must be responsible for damages."



<P>And obeying orders, Laurie heroically shut his eyes while something



<P>was put into his arms.&nbsp; A peal of laughter from Jo, Amy,



<P>Mrs. March, Hannah, and John caused him to open them the next



<P>minute, to find himself invested with two babies instead of one.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>No wonder they laughed, for the expression of his face was



<P>droll enough to convulse a Quaker, as he stood and stared wildly



<P>from the unconscious innocents to the hilarious spectators with



<P>such dismay that Jo sat down on the floor and screamed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Twins, by Jupiter!" was all he said for a minute, then



<P>turning to the women with an appealing look that was comically



<P>piteous, he added, "Take `em quick, somebody!&nbsp; I'm going to



<P>laugh, and I shall drop `em."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo rescued his babies, and marched up and down, with one



<P>on each are, as if already initiated into the mysteries of babytending,



<P>while Laurie laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's the best joke of the season, isn't it?&nbsp; I wouldn't have



<P>told you, for I set my heart on surprising you, and I flatter



<P>myself I've done it," said Jo, when she got her breath.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I never was more staggered in my life.&nbsp; Isn't it fun?&nbsp; Are

they boys?



<P>What are you going to name them?&nbsp; Let's have another look.&nbsp;

Hold me up,



<P>Jo, for upon my life it's one too many for me," returned Laurie,



<P>regarding the infants with the air of a big,&nbsp; benevolent Newfoundland



<P>looking at a pair of infantile kittens.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Boy and girl.&nbsp; Aren't they beauties?" said the proud papa,



<P>beaming upon the little red squirmers as if they were unfledged angels.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Most remarkable children I ever saw.&nbsp; Which is which?" and



<P>Laurie bent like a well-sweep to examine the prodigies.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Amy put a blue ribbon on the boy and a pink on the girl,



<P>French fashion, so you can always tell.&nbsp; Besides, one has blue



<P>eyes and one brown.&nbsp; Kiss them, Uncle Teddy," said wicked Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm afraid they mightn't like it," began Laurie, with unusual



<P>timidity in such matters.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Of course they will, they are used to it now.&nbsp; Do it this



<P>minute, sir!" commanded Jo, fearing he might propose a proxy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie screwed up his face and obeyed with a gingerly peck



<P>at each little cheek that produced another laugh, and made the



<P>babies squeal.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There, I knew they didn't like it!&nbsp; That's the boy, see



<P>him kick, he hits out with his fists like a good one.&nbsp; Now then,



<P>young Brooke, pitch into a man of your own size, will you?" cried



<P>Laurie, delighted with a poke in the face from a tiny fist, flapping



<P>aimlessly about.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He's to be named John Laurence, and the girl Margaret, after



<P>mother and grandmother.&nbsp; We shall call her Daisey, so as not to



<P>have two Megs, and I suppose the mannie will be Jack, unless we



<P>find a better name," said Amy, with aunt-like interest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Name him Demijohn, and call him Demi for short," said Laurie

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Daisy and Demi, just the thing!&nbsp; I knew Teddy would do it,"



<P>cried Jo clapping her hands.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Teddy certainly had done it that time, for the babies were



<P>`Daisy' and `Demi' to the end of the chapter.

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo was very busy in the garret, for the October days began



<P>to grow chilly, and the afternoons were short.&nbsp; For two or three



<P>hours the sun lay warmly in the high window, showing Jo seated



<P>on the old sofa, writing busily, with her papers spread out



<P>upon a trunk before her, while Scrabble, the pet rat,



<P>promenaded the beams overhead, accompanied by his oldest son,



<P>a fine young fellow, who was evidently very proud of his whiskers.



<P>Quite absorbed in her work, Jo scribbled away till the last page



<P>was filled, when she signed her name with a flourish and threw



<P>down her pen, exclaiming...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There, I've done my best!&nbsp; If this won't suit I shall have



<P>to wait till I can do better."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lying back on the sofa, she read the manuscript carefully



<P>through, making dashes here and there, and putting in many



<P>exclamation points, which looked like little balloons.&nbsp; Then she



<P>tied it up with a smart red ribbon, and sat a minute looking at



<P>it with a sober, wistful expression, which plainly showed how



<P>ernest her work had been.&nbsp; Jo's desk up here was an old tin



<P>kitchen which hung against the wall.&nbsp; It it she kept her papers,



<P>and a few books, safely shut away from Scrabble, who, being



<P>likewise of a literary turn, was fond of making a circulating



<P>library of such books as were left in his way by eating the



<P>leaves.&nbsp; From this tin receptacle Jo produced another manuscript,



<P>and putting both in her pocket, crept quietly downstairs, leaving



<P>her friends to nibble on her pens and taste her ink.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She put on her hat and jacket as noiselessly as possible, and



<P>going to the back entry window, got out upon the roof of a low



<P>porch, swung herself down to the grassy bank, and took a roundabout



<P>way to the road.&nbsp; Once there, she composed herself, hailed a passing



<P>omnibus, and rolled away to town, looking very merry and mysterious.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If anyone had been watching her, he would have thought her



<P>movements decidedly peculiar, for on alighting, she went off at a



<P>great pace till she reached a certain number in a certain busy



<P>street.&nbsp; Having found the place with some difficulty, she went



<P>into the doorway, looked up the dirty stairs, and after standing



<P>stock still a minute, suddenly dived into the street and walked



<P>away as rapidly as she came.&nbsp; This maneuver she repeated several



<P>times, to the great amusement of a black-eyed young gentleman



<P>lounging in the window of a building opposite.&nbsp; On returning for



<P>the third time, Jo gave herself a shake, pulled her hat over her



<P>eyes, and walked up the stairs, looking as if she were going to



<P>have all her teeth out.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a dentist's sign, among others, which adorned the



<P>entrance, and after staring a moment at the pair of artificial



<P>jaws which slowly opened and shut to draw attention to a fine



<P>set of teeth, the young gentleman put on his coat, took his hat,



<P>and went down to post himself in the opposite doorway, saying



<P>with a smile and a shiver, "It's like her to come alone, but if



<P>she has a bad time she'll need someone to help her home."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In ten minutes Jo came running downstairs with a very red



<P>face and the general appearance of a person who had just passed



<P>through a trying ordeal of some sort.&nbsp; When she saw the young



<P>gentleman she looked anything but pleased, and passed him with a



<P>nod.&nbsp; But he followed, asking with an air of sympathy, "Did you



<P>have a bad time?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not very."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You got through quickly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, thank goodness!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why did you go alone?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Didn't want anyone to know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You're the oddest fellow I ever saw.&nbsp; How many did you



<P>have out?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo looked at her friend as if she did not understand him, then



<P>began to laugh as if mightily amused at something.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There are two which I want to have come out, but I must wait



<P>a week."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What are you laughing at?&nbsp; You are up to some mischief, Jo,"



<P>said Laurie, looking mystified.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So are you.&nbsp; What were you doing, sir, up in that billiard



<P>saloon?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Begging your pardon, ma'am, it wasn't a billiard saloon, but



<P>a gymnasium, and I was taking a lesson in fencing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm glad of that."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"why?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You can teach me, and then when we play HAMLET, you can be



<P>Laertes, and we'll make a fine thing of the fencing scene."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Laurie burst out with a hearty boy's laugh, which made



<P>several passers-by smile in spite of themselves.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll teach you whether we play HAMLET or not.&nbsp; It's grand



<P>fun and will straighten you up capitally.&nbsp; But I don't believe



<P>that was your only reason for saying `I'm glad' in that decided



<P>way, was it now?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I was glad that you were not in the saloon, because I



<P>hope you never go to such places.&nbsp; Do you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not often."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wish you wouldn't."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's no harm, Jo.&nbsp; I have billiards at home, but it's no fun



<P>unless you have good players, so, as I'm fond of it, I come sometimes



<P>and have a game with Ned Moffat or some of the other fellows."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, dear, I'm so sorry, for you'll get to liking it better and



<P>better, and will waste time and money, and grow like those dreadful



<P>boys.&nbsp; I did hope you'd stay respectable and be a satisfaction

to



<P>your friends," said Jo, shaking her head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Can't a fellow take a little innocent amusement now and then



<P>without losing his respectability?" asked Laurie, looking nettled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That depends upon how and where he takes it.&nbsp; I don't like



<P>Ned and his set, and wish you'd keep out of it.&nbsp; Mother won't let



<P>us have him at our house, though he wants to come.&nbsp; And if you



<P>grow like him she won't be willing to have us frolic together as



<P>we do now."



<P>"Won't she?" asked Laurie anxiously.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, she can't bear fashionable young men, and she'd shut us



<P>all up in bandboxes rather than have us associate with them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, she needn't get out her bandboxes yet.&nbsp; I'm not a



<P>fashionable party and don't mean to be, but I do like harmless



<P>larks now and then, don't you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, nobody minds them, so lark away, but don't get wild,



<P>will you?&nbsp; Or there will be an end of all our good times."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll be a double distilled saint."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I can't bear saints.&nbsp; Just be a simple, honest, respectable



<P>boy, and we'll never desert you.&nbsp; I don't know what I should do



<P>if you acted like Mr. King's son.&nbsp; He had plenty of money, but



<P>didn't know how to spend it, and got tipsy and gambled, and ran



<P>away, and forged his father's name, I believe, and was altogether



<P>horrid."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You think I'm likely to do the same?&nbsp; Much obliged."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I don't--oh, dear, no!--but I hear people talking about



<P>money being such a temptation, and I sometimes wish you were poor.



<P>I shouldn't worry then."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you worry about me, Jo?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A little, when you look moody and discontented, as you sometimes do,



<P>for you've got such a strong will, if you once get started wrong,



<P>I'm afraid it would be hard to stop you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie walked in silence a few minutes, and Jo watched him,



<P>wishing she had held her tongue, for his eyes looked angry, though



<P>his lips smiled as if at her warnings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Are you going to deliver lectures all the way home?" he



<P>asked presently.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Of course not.&nbsp; Why?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Because if you are, I'll take a bus.&nbsp; If you're not, I'd like



<P>to walk with you and tell you something very interesting."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I won't preach any more, and I'd like to hear the news



<P>immensely."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very well, then, come on.&nbsp; It's a secret, and if I tell you,



<P>you must tell me yours."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I haven't got any," began Jo, but stopped suddenly,



<P>remembering that she had.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You know you have--you can't hide anything, so up and fess,



<P>or I won't tell," cried Laurie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Is your secret a nice one?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, isn't it!&nbsp; All about people you know, and such fun!&nbsp;

You



<P>ought to hear it, and I've been aching to tell it this long time.



<P>Come, you begin."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You'll not say anything about it at home, will you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not a word."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And you won't tease me in private?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I never tease."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, you do.&nbsp; You get everything you want out of people.&nbsp;

I



<P>don't know how you do it, but you are a born wheedler."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you.&nbsp; Fire away."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I've left two stories with a newspaperman, and he's to



<P>give his answer next week," whispered Jo, in her confidant's ear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hurrah for Miss March, the celebrated American authoress!"



<P>cried Laurie, throwing up his hat and catching it again, to the



<P>great delight of two ducks, four cats, five hens, and half a



<P>dozen Irish children, for they were out of the city now.



<P>"Hush!&nbsp; It won't come to anything, I dare say, but I couldn't



<P>rest till I had tried, and I said nothing about it because I didn't



<P>want anyone else to be disappointed."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It won't fail.&nbsp; Why, Jo, your stories are works of Shakespeare



<P>compared to half the rubbish that is published every day.



<P>Won't it be fun to see them in print, and shan't we feel proud of



<P>our authoress?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo's eyes sparkled, for it is always pleasant to be believed



<P>in, and a friend's praise is always sweeter than a dozen newspaper



<P>puffs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Where's your secret?&nbsp; Play fair, Teddy, or I'll never believe



<P>you again," she said, trying to extinguish the brilliant hopes that



<P>blazed up at a word of encouragement.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I may get into a scrape for telling, but I didn't promise



<P>not to, so I will, for I never feel easy in my mind till I've told



<P>you any plummy bit of news I get.&nbsp; I know where Meg's glove is."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Is that all? said Jo, looking disappointed, as Laurie nodded



<P>and twinkled with a face full of mysterious intelligence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's quite enough for the present, as you'll agree when I



<P>tell you where it is."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Tell, then."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie bent, and whispered three words in Jo's ear, which



<P>produced a comical change.&nbsp; She stood and stared at him for a



<P>minute, looking both surprised and displeased, then walked on,



<P>saying sharply, "How do you know?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Saw it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Where?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Pocket."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"All this time?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, isn't that romantic?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, it's horrid."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't you like it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Of course I don't.&nbsp; It's ridiculous, it won't be allowed.&nbsp;

My



<P>patience!&nbsp; What would Meg say?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are not to tell anyone.&nbsp; Mind that."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I didn't promise."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That was understood, and I trusted you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I won't for the present, anyway, but I'm disgusted, and



<P>wish you hadn't told me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I thought you'd be pleased."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"At the idea of anybody coming to take Meg away? No, thank you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You'll feel better about it when somebody comes to take you



<P>away."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'd like to see anyone try it," cried Jo fiercely.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So should I!"&nbsp; And Laurie chuckled at the idea.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't think secrets agree with me, I feel rumpled up in



<P>my mind since you told me that," said Jo rather ungratefully.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Race down this hill with me, and you'll be all right,"



<P>suggested Laurie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>No one was in sight, the smooth road sloped invitingly before



<P>her, and finding the temptation irresistible, Jo darted away, soon



<P>leaving hat and comb behind her and scattering hairpins as she ran.



<P>Laurie reached the goal first and was quite satisfied with the



<P>success of his treatment, for his Atalanta came panting up



<P>with flying hair, bright eyes, ruddy cheeks, and no signs of



<P>dissatisfaction in her face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wish I was a horse, then I could run for miles in this



<P>splendid air, and not lose my breath.&nbsp; It was capital, but see



<P>what a guy it's made me.&nbsp; Go, pick up my things, like a cherub,



<P>as you are," said Jo, dropping down under a maple tree, which



<P>was carpeting the bank with crimson leaves.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie leisurely departed to recover the lost property, and



<P>Jo bundled up her braids, hoping no one would pass by till she



<P>was tidy again.&nbsp; But someone did pass, and who should it be but



<P>Meg, looking particularly ladylike in her state and festival



<P>suit, for she had been making calls.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What in the world are you doing here?" she asked, regarding



<P>her disheveled sister with well-bred surprise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Getting leaves," meekly answered Jo, sorting the rosy handful



<P>she had just swept up.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And hairpins," added Laurie, throwing half a dozen into Jo's



<P>lap.&nbsp; "They grow on this road, Meg, so do combs and brown straw



<P>hats."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You have been running, Jo.&nbsp; How could you?&nbsp; When will you

stop



<P>such romping ways?" said Meg reprovingly, as she settled her cuffs



<P>and smoothed her hair, with which the wind had taken liberties.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Never till I'm stiff and old and have to use a crutch.&nbsp; Don't



<P>try to make me grow up before my time, Meg.&nbsp; It's hard enough to



<P>have you change all of a sudden.&nbsp; Let me be a little girl as long



<P>as I can."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As she spoke, Jo bent over the leaves to hide the trembling



<P>of her lips, for lately she had felt that Margaret was fast getting



<P>to be a woman, and Laurie's secret made her dread the separation



<P>which must surely come some time and now seemed very near.&nbsp; He

saw



<P>the trouble in her face and drew Meg's attention from it by asking



<P>quickly, "Where have you been calling, all so fine?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"At the Gardiners', and Sallie has been telling me all about



<P>Belle Moffat's wedding.&nbsp; It was very splendid, and they have gone



<P>to spend the winter in Paris.&nbsp; Just think how delightful that



<P>must be!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you envy her, Meg?" said Laurie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm afraid I do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm glad of it!" muttered Jo, tying on her hat with a jerk.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why?" asked Meg, looking surprised.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Because if you care much about riches, you will never go and



<P>marry a poor man," said Jo, frowning at Laurie, who was mutely



<P>warning her to mind what she said.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall never `go and marry' anyone," observed Meg, walking



<P>on with great dignity while the others followed, laughing,



<P>whispering, skipping stones, and `behaving like children',



<P>as Meg said to herself, though she might have been tempted



<P>to join them if she had not had her best dress on.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For a week or two, Jo behaved so queerly that her sisters



<P>were quite bewildered.&nbsp; She rushed to the door when the postman



<P>rang, was rude to Mr. Brooke whenever they met, would sit looking



<P>at Meg with a woe-begone face, occasionally jumping up to shake



<P>and then kiss her in a very mysterious manner.&nbsp; Laurie and she



<P>were always making signs to one another, and talking about



<P>`Spread Eagles' till the girls declared they had both lost their



<P>wits.&nbsp; On the second Saturday after Jo got out of the window, Meg,



<P>as she sat sewing at her window, was scandalized by the sight of



<P>Laurie chasing Jo all over the garden and finally capturing her



<P>in Amy's bower.&nbsp; What went on there, Meg could not see, but shrieks



<P>of laughter were heard, followed by the murmur of voices and a



<P>great flapping of newspapers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What shall we do with that girl?&nbsp; She never will behave like



<P>a young lady," sighed Meg, as she watched the race with a



<P>disapproving face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hope she won't.&nbsp; She is so funny and dear as she is," said



<P>Beth, who had never betrayed that she was a little hurt at Jo's



<P>having secrets with anyone but her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's very trying, but we never can make her commy la fo,"



<P>added Amy, who sat making some new frills for herself, with her



<P>curls tied up in a very becoming way., two agreeable things that



<P>made her feel unusually elegant and ladylike.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In a few minutes Jo bounced in, laid herself on the sofa,



<P>and affected to read.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Have you anything interesting there?" asked Meg, with condescension.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nothing but a story, won't amount to much, I guess," returned



<P>Jo, carefully keeping the name of the paper out of sight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You'd better read it aloud.&nbsp; That will amuse us and keep you



<P>out of mischief," said Amy in her most grown-up tone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What's the name?" asked Beth, wondering why Jo kept her face



<P>behind the sheet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The Rival Painters."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That sounds well.&nbsp; Read it," said Meg.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With a loud "Hem!" and a long breath, Jo began to read very



<P>fast.&nbsp; The girls listened with interest, for the tale was romantic,



<P>and somewhat pathetic, as most of the characters died in the end.



<P>"I like that about the splendid picture," was Amy's approving



<P>remark, as Jo paused.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I prefer the lovering part.&nbsp; Viola and Angelo are two of our



<P>favorite names, isn't that queer?" said Meg, wiping her eyes, for



<P>the lovering part was tragical.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Who wrote it?" asked Beth, who had caught a glimpse of Jo's



<P>face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The reader suddenly sat up, cast away the paper, displaying



<P>a flushed countenance, and with a funny mixture of solemnity and



<P>excitement replied in a loud voice, "Your sister."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You?" cried Meg, dropping her work.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's very good," said Amy critically.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I knew it!&nbsp; I knew it! Oh, my Jo, I am so proud!"&nbsp; And Beth



<P>ran to hug her sister and exult over this splendid success.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Dear me, how delighted they all were, to be sure!&nbsp; How Meg



<P>wouldn't believe it till she saw the words.&nbsp; "Miss Josephine



<P>March," actually printed in the paper.&nbsp; How graciously Amy



<P>critisized the artistic parts of the story, and offered hints for



<P>a sequel, which unfortunately couldn't be carried out, as the



<P>hero and heroine were dead.&nbsp; How Beth got excited, and skipped



<P>and sang with joy.&nbsp; How Hannah came in to exclaim, "Sakes alive,



<P>well I never!" in great astonishment at `that Jo's doin's'.&nbsp; How



<P>proud Mrs. March was when she knew it.&nbsp; How Jo laughed, with



<P>tears in her eyes, as she declared she might as well be a peacock



<P>and done with it.&nbsp; and how th `Spread Eagle' might be said to



<P>flap his wings triumphantly over the House of March, as the



<P>paper passed from hand to hand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Tell us about it."&nbsp; "When did it come?" "How much did you



<P>get for it?" "What will Father say?" "Won't Laurie laugh?" cried



<P>the family, all in one breath as they clustered about Jo, for



<P>these foolish, affectionate people mad a jubilee of every little



<P>household joy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Stop jabbering, girls, and I'll tell you everything,"



<P>said Jo, wondering if Miss Burney felt any grander over her



<P>Evilina than she did over her `Rival Painters'.&nbsp; Having told



<P>how she disposed of her tales, Jo added, "And when I went to



<P>get my answer, the man said he liked them both, but didn't



<P>pay beginners, only let them print in his paper, and noticed



<P>the stories.&nbsp; It was good practice, he said, and when the



<P>beginners improved, anyone would pay.&nbsp; So I let him have the two



<P>stories, and today this was sent to me, and Laurie caught me



<P>with it and insisted on seeing it, so I let him.&nbsp; And he said



<P>it was good, and I shall write more, and he's going to get the



<P>next paid for, and I am so happy, for in time I may be able to



<P>support myself and help the girls."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo's breath gave out here, and wrapping her head in the



<P>paper, she bedewed her little story with a few natural tears,



<P>for to be independent and earn the praise of those she loved



<P>were the dearest wishes of her heart, and this seemed to be the



<P>first step toward that happy end.

<B>CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In France the young girls have a dull time of it till they are



<P>married, when `Vive la liberte!' becomes their motto.&nbsp; In America,



<P>as everyone knows, girls early sign the declaration of independence,



<P>and enjoy their freedom with republican zest, but the young matrons



<P>usually abdicate with the first heir to the throne and go into a



<P>seclusion almost as close as a French nunnery, though by no means



<P>as quiet.&nbsp; Whether they like it or not, they are virtually put



<P>upon the shelf as soon as the wedding excitement is over, and most



<P>of them might exclaim, as did a very pretty woman the other day,



<P>"I'm as handsome as ever, but no one takes any notice of me because



<P>I'm married."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Not being a belle or even a fashionable lady, Meg did not



<P>experience this affliction till her babies were a year old,



<P>for in her little world primitive customs prevailed, and she



<P>found herself more admired and beloved than ever.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As she was a womanly little woman, the maternal instinct



<P>was very strong, and she was entirely absorbed in her children,



<P>to the utter exclusion of everything and everybody else.&nbsp; Day



<P>and night she brooded over them with tireless devotion and



<P>anxiety, leaving John to the tender mercies of the help, for



<P>an Irish lady now presided over the kitchen department.&nbsp; Being



<P>a domestic man, John decidedly missed the wifely attentions he



<P>had been accustomed to receive, but as he adored his babies, he



<P>cheerfully relinquished his comfort for a time, supposing with



<P>masculine ignorance that peace would soon be restored.&nbsp; But



<P>three months passed, and there was no return of repose.&nbsp; Meg



<P>looked worn and nervous, the babies absorbed every minute of



<P>her time, the house was neglected, and Kitty, the cook, who took



<P>life `aisy', kept him on short commons.&nbsp; When he went out in



<P>the morning he was bewildered by small commissions for the captive



<P>mamma, if he came gaily in at night, eager to embrace his



<P>family, he was quenched by a "Hush!&nbsp; They are just asleep after



<P>worrying all day."&nbsp; If he proposed a little amusement at home,



<P>"No, it would disturb the babies."&nbsp; If he hinted at a lecture



<P>or a concert, he was answered with a reproachful look, and a



<P>decided "Leave my children for pleasure, never!"&nbsp; His sleep was



<P>broken by infant wails and visions of a phantom figure pacing



<P>noiselessly to and fro in the watches of the night.&nbsp; His meals



<P>were interrupted by the frequent flight of the presiding genius,



<P>who deserted him, half-helped, if a muffled chirp sounded from



<P>the nest above.&nbsp; And when he read his paper of an evening,



<P>Demi's colic got into the shipping list and Daisy's fall affected



<P>the price of stocks, for Mrs. Brooke was only interested in domestic

news.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The poor man was very uncomfortable, for the children had



<P>bereft him of his wife, home was merely a nursery and the perpetual



<P>`hushing' made him feel like a brutal intruder whenever



<P>he entered the sacred precincts of Babyland.&nbsp; He bore it very



<P>patiently for six months, and when no signs of amendment appeared,



<P>he did what other paternal exiles do--tried to get a little comfort



<P>elsewhere.&nbsp; Scott had married and gone to housekeeping not



<P>far off, and John fell into the way of running over for an hour



<P>or two of an evening, when his own parlor was empty, and his



<P>own wife singing lullabies that seemed to have no end.&nbsp; Mrs.



<P>Scott was a lively, pretty girl, with nothing to do but be



<P>agreeable, and she performed her mission most successfully.&nbsp; The



<P>parlor was always bright and attractive, the chessboard ready,



<P>the piano in tune, plenty of gay gossip, and a nice little supper



<P>set forth in tempting style.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>John would have preferred his own fireside if it had not



<P>been so lonely, but as it was he gratefully took the next best



<P>thing and enjoyed his neighbor's society.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg rather approved of the new arrangement at first, and



<P>found it a relief to know that John was having a good time



<P>instead of dozing in the parlor, or tramping about the house



<P>and waking the children.&nbsp; But by-and-by, when the teething



<P>worry was over and the idols went to sleep at proper hours,



<P>leaving Mamma time to rest, she began to miss John, and find



<P>her workbasket dull company, when he was not sitting opposite



<P>in his old dressing gown, comfortably scorching his slippers



<P>on the fender.&nbsp; She would not ask him to stay at home, but felt



<P>injured because he did not know that she wanted him without



<P>being told, entirely forgetting the many evenings he had waited



<P>for her in vain.&nbsp; She was nervous and worn out with watching



<P>and worry, and in that unreasonable frame of mind which the best



<P>of mothers occasionally experience when domestic cares oppress



<P>them.&nbsp; Want of exercise robs them of cheerfulness, and too much



<P>devotion to that idol of American women, the teapot, makes them



<P>feel as if they were all nerve and no muscle.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," she would say, looking in the glass, "I'm getting



<P>old and ugly.&nbsp; John doesn't find me interesting any longer, so



<P>he leaves his faded wife and goes to see his pretty neighbor,



<P>who has no incumbrances.&nbsp; Well, the babies love me, they don't



<P>care if I am thin and pale and haven't time to crimp my hair,



<P>they are my comfort, and some day John will see what I've



<P>gladly sacrificed for them, won't he, my precious?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To which pathetic appeal daisy would answer with a coo,



<P>or Demi with a crow, and Meg would put by her lamentations for



<P>a maternal revel, which soothed her solitude for the time being.



<P>But the pain increased as politics absorbed John, who was always



<P>running over to discuss interesting points with Scott, quite



<P>unconscious that Meg missed him.&nbsp; Not a word did she say, however,



<P>till her mother found her in tears one day, and insisted



<P>on knowing what the matter was, for Meg's drooping spirits had



<P>not escaped her observation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wouldn't tell anyone except you, Mother, but I really



<P>do need advice, for if John goes on much longer I might as well



<P>be widowed," replied Mrs. Brooke, drying her tears on Daisy's



<P>bib with an injured air.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Goes on how, my dear?" asked her mother anxiously.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He's away all day, and at night when I want to see him,



<P>he is continually going over to the Scotts'.&nbsp; It isn't fair



<P>that I should have the hardest work, and never any amusement.



<P>Men are very selfish, even the best of them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So are women.&nbsp; Don't blame John till you see where you



<P>are wrong yourself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But it can't be right for him to neglect me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't you neglect him?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, Mother, I thought you'd take my part!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So I do, as far as sympathizing goes, but I think the fault



<P>is yours, Meg."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't see how."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Let me show you.&nbsp; Did John ever neglect you, as you call it,



<P>while you made it a point to give him your society of an evening,



<P>his only leisure time?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, but I can't do it now, with two babies to tend."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think you could, dear, and I think you ought.&nbsp; May I



<P>speak quite freely, and will you remember that it's Mother who



<P>blames as well as Mother who sympathizes?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed I will!&nbsp; Speak to me as if I were little Meg again.



<P>I often feel as if I needed teaching more than ever since these



<P>babies look to me for everything."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg drew her low chair beside her mother's, and with a little



<P>interruption in either lap, the two women rocked and talked lovingly



<P>together, feeling that the tie of motherhood made them more one



<P>than ever.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You have only made the mistake that most young wives make-forgotten



<P>your duty to your husband in your love for your children.



<P>A very natural and forgivable mistake, Meg, but one that



<P>had better be remedied before you take to different ways, for



<P>children should draw you nearer than ever, not separate you, as



<P>if they were all yours, and John had nothing to do but support



<P>them.&nbsp; I've seen it for some weeks, but have not spoken, feeling



<P>sure it would come right in time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm afraid it won't.&nbsp; If I ask him to stay, he'll think I'm



<P>jealous, and I wouldn't insult him by such an idea.&nbsp; He doesn't



<P>see that I want him, and I don't know how to tell him without



<P>words."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Make it so pleasant he won't want to go away.&nbsp; My dear,



<P>he's longing for his little home, but it isn't home without you,



<P>and you are always in the nursery."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oughtn't I to be there?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not all the time, too much confinement makes you nervous,



<P>and then you are unfitted for everything.&nbsp; Besides, you owe



<P>something to John as well as to the babies.&nbsp; Don't neglect husband



<P>for children, don't shut him out of the nursery, but teach



<P>him how to help in it.&nbsp; His place is there as well as yours, and



<P>the children need him.&nbsp; Let him feel that he has a part to do,

and



<P>he will do it gladly and faithfully, and it will be better for you



<P>all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You really think so, Mother?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I know it, Meg, for I've tried it, and I seldom give advice



<P>unless I've proved its practicability.&nbsp; When you and Jo were little,



<P>I went on just as you are, feeling as if I didn't do my duty unless



<P>I devoted myself wholly to you.&nbsp; Poor Father took to his books,



<P>after I had refused all offers of help, and left me to try my experiment



<P>alone.&nbsp; I struggled along as well as I could, but Jo was



<P>too much for me.&nbsp; I nearly spoiled her by indulgence.&nbsp; You

were



<P>poorly, and I worried about you till I fell sick myself.&nbsp; Then



<P>Father came to the rescue, quietly managed everything, and made



<P>himself so helpful that I saw my mistake, and never have been able



<P>to got on without him since.&nbsp; That is the secret of our home happiness.



<P>He does not let business wean him from the little cares



<P>and duties that affect us all, and I try not to let domestic worries



<P>destroy my interest in his pursuits.&nbsp; Each do our part alone in



<P>many things, but at home we work together, always."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is so, Mother, and my great wish is to be to my husband



<P>and children what you have been to yours.&nbsp; Show me how, I'll do



<P>anything you say."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You were always my docile daughter.&nbsp; Well, dear, if I were



<P>you, I'd let John have more to do with the management of Demi,



<P>for the boy needs training, and it's none too soon to begin.



<P>Then I'd do what I have often proposed, let Hannah come and



<P>help you.&nbsp; She is a capital nurse, and you may trust the precious



<P>babies to her while you do more housework.&nbsp; You need the exercise,



<P>Hannah would enjoy the rest, and John would find his wife again.



<P>Go out more, keep cheerful as well as busy, for you are the



<P>sunshine-maker of the family, and if you get dismal there is no



<P>fair weather.&nbsp; Then I'd try to take an interest in whatever John



<P>likes--talk with him, let him read to you, exchange ideas, and



<P>help each other in that way.&nbsp; Don't shut yourself up in a bandbox



<P>because you are a woman, but understand what is going on, and



<P>educate yourself to take your part in the world's work, for it



<P>all affects you and yours."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"John is so sensible, I'm afraid he will think I'm stupid if



<P>I ask questions about politics and things."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't believe he would.&nbsp; Love covers a multitude of sins,



<P>and of whom could you ask more freely than of him?&nbsp; Try it, and



<P>see if he doesn't find your society far more agreeable than Mrs.



<P>Scott's suppers."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I will.&nbsp; Poor John!&nbsp; I'm afraid I have neglected him sadly,



<P>but I thought I was right, and he never said anything."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He tried not to be selfish, but he has felt rather forlorn,



<P>I fancy.&nbsp; This is just the time, Meg, when young married people



<P>are apt to grow apart, and the very time when they ought to be



<P>most together, for the first tenderness soon wears off, unless



<P>care is taken to preserve it.&nbsp; And no time is so beautiful and



<P>precious to parents as the first years of the little lives



<P>given to them to train.&nbsp; Don't let John be a stranger to the



<P>babies, for they will do more to keep him safe and happy in



<P>this world of trial and temptation than anything else, and



<P>through them you will learn to know and love one another as



<P>you should.&nbsp; Now, dear, good-by.&nbsp; Think over Mother's preachment,



<P>act upon it if it seems good, and God bless you all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg did think it over, found it good, and acted upon it,



<P>though the first attempt was not made exactly as she planned



<P>to have it.&nbsp; Of course the children tyrannized over her, and



<P>ruled the house as soon as they found out that kicking and



<P>squalling brought them whatever they wanted.&nbsp; Mamma was an



<P>abject slave to their caprices, but Papa was not so easily



<P>subjugated, and occasionally afflicted his tender spouse by



<P>an attempt at paternal discipline with his obstreperous son.



<P>For Demi inherited a trifle of his sire's firmness of character,



<P>we won't call it obstinacy, and when he made up his



<P>little to have or to do anything, all the king's horses and



<P>all the king's men could not change that pertinacious little



<P>mind.&nbsp; Mamma thought the dear too young to be taught to conquer



<P>his prejudices, but Papa believed that it never was too



<P>soon to learn obedience.&nbsp; So Master Demi early discovered that



<P>when he undertook to `wrastle' with `Parpar', he always got



<P>the worst of it, yet like the Englishman, baby respected the



<P>man who conquered him, and loved the father whose grave "No,



<P>no," was more impressive than all Mamma's love pats.



<P>A few days after the talk with her mother, Meg resolved



<P>to try a social evening with John, so she ordered a nice



<P>supper, set the parlor in order, dressed herself prettily, and



<P>put the children to bed early, that nothing should interfere



<P>with her experiment.&nbsp; But unfortunately Demi's most unconquerable



<P>prejudice was against going to bed, and that night he decided



<P>to go on a rampage.&nbsp; So poor Meg sang and rocked,



<P>told stories and tried every sleep-prevoking wile she could



<P>devise, but all in vain, the big eyes wouldn't shut, and long



<P>after Daisy had gone to byelow, like the chubby little bunch



<P>of good nature she was, naughty Demi lay staring at the light,



<P>with the most discouragingly wide-awake expression of countenance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Will Demi lie still like a good boy, while Mamma runs



<P>down and gives poor Papa his tea?" asked Meg, as the hall



<P>door softly closed, and the well-known step went tip-toeing



<P>into the dining room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Me has tea!" said Demi, preparing to join in the revel.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, but I'll save you some little cakies for breakfast,



<P>if you'll go bye-by like Daisy.&nbsp; Will you, lovey?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Iss!" and Demi shut his eyes tight, as if to catch sleep



<P>and hurry the desired day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Taking advantage of the propitious moment, Meg slipped



<P>away and ran down to greet her husband with a smiling face



<P>and the little blue bow in her hair which was his especial



<P>admiration.&nbsp; He saw it at once and said with pleased surprise,



<P>"Why, little mother, how gay we are tonight.&nbsp; Do you expect



<P>company?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Only you, dear."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I'm tired of being dowdy, so I dressed up as a



<P>change.&nbsp; You always make yourself nice for table, no matter



<P>how tired you are, so why shouldn't I when I have the time?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do it out of respect for you, my dear," said old-fashioned John.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ditto, ditto, Mr. Brooke," laughed Meg, looking young



<P>and pretty again, as she nodded to him over the teapot.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, it's altogether delightful, and like old times.&nbsp; This



<P>tastes right.&nbsp; I drink your health, dear."&nbsp; And John sipped

his



<P>tea with an air of reposeful rapture, which was of very short



<P>duration however, for as he put down his cup, the door handle



<P>rattled mysteriously, and a little voice was heard, saying impatiently



<P>...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Opy doy.&nbsp; Me's tummin!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's that naughty boy.&nbsp; I told him to go to sleep alone,



<P>and here he is, downstairs, getting his death a-cold pattering



<P>over that canvas," said Meg, answering the call.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mornin' now," announced Demi in joyful tone as he entered,



<P>with his long nightgown gracefully festooned over his arm and



<P>every curl bobbing gayly as he pranced about the table, eyeing



<P>the `cakies' with loving glances.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, it isn't morning yet.&nbsp; You must go to bed, and not



<P>trouble poor Mamma.&nbsp; Then you can have the little cake with



<P>sugar on it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Me loves Parpar," said the artful one, preparing to climb



<P>the paternal knee and revel in forbidden joys.&nbsp; But John shook



<P>his head, and said to Meg...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If you told him to stay up there, and go to sleep alone,



<P>make him do it, or he will never learn to mind you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, of course.&nbsp; Come, Demi."&nbsp; And Meg led her son away,



<P>feeling a strong desire to spank the little marplot who hopped



<P>beside her, laboring under the delusion that the bribe was to



<P>be administered as soon as they reached the nursery.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nor was he disappointed, for that shortsighted woman



<P>actually gave him a lump of sugar, tucked him into his bed,



<P>and forbade any more promenades till morning.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Iss!" said Demi the perjured, blissfully sucking his sugar,



<P>and regarding his first attempt as eminently successful.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg returned to her place, and supper was progressing



<P>pleasantly, when the little ghost walked again and exposed



<P>the maternal delinquencies by boldly demanding, "More sudar,



<P>Marmar."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now this won't do," said John, hardening his heart against



<P>the engaging little sinner.&nbsp; "We shall never know any peace till



<P>that child learns togo to bed properly.&nbsp; You have made a slave

of



<P>yourself long enough.&nbsp; Give him one lesson, and then there will



<P>be an end of it.&nbsp; Put him in his bed and leave him, Meg."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He won't stay there, he never does unless I sit by him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll manage him.&nbsp; Demi, go upstairs, and get into your bed,



<P>as Mamma bids you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"S'ant!" replied the young rebel, helping himself to the



<P>coveted `cakie', and beginning to eat the same with calm audacity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You must never say that to Papa.&nbsp; I shall carry you if you



<P>don't go yourself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Go 'way, me don't love Parpar."&nbsp; And Demi retired to his



<P>mother's skirts for protection.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But even that refuge proved unavailing, for he was delivered



<P>over to the enemy, with a "Be gentle with him, John,"



<P>which struck the culprit with dismay, for when Mamma deserted



<P>him, then the judgment day was at hand.&nbsp; Bereft of his cake,



<P>defrauded of his frolic, and borne away by a strong hand to



<P>that detested bed, poor Demi could not restrain his wrath, but



<P>openly defied Papa, and kicked and screamed lustily all the



<P>way upstairs.&nbsp; The minute he was put into bed on one side, he



<P>rolled out on the other, and made for the door, only to be



<P>ignominiously caught up by the tail of his little toga and



<P>put back again, which lively performance was kept up till the



<P>young man's strength gave out, when he devoted himself to



<P>roaring at the top of his voice.&nbsp; This vocal exercise usually



<P>conquered Meg, but John sat as unmoved as the post which is



<P>popularly believed to be deaf.&nbsp; No coaxing, no sugar, no



<P>lullaby, no story, even the light was put out and only the



<P>red glow of the fire enlivened the `big dark' which Demi



<P>regarded with curiosity rather than fear.&nbsp; This new order



<P>of things disgusted him, and he howled dismally for `Marmar',



<P>as his angry passions subsided, and recollections of his



<P>tender bondwoman returned to the captive autocrat.&nbsp; The



<P>plaintive wail which succeeded the passionate roar went to



<P>Meg's heart, and she ran up to say beseechingly...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Let me stay with him, he'll be good now, John."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, my dear.&nbsp; I've told him he must go to sleep, as you



<P>bid him, and he must, if I stay here all night."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But he'll cry himself sick," pleaded Meg, reproaching herself



<P>for deserting her boy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, he won't, he's so tired he will soon drop off and then



<P>the matter is settled, for he will understand that he has got to



<P>mind.&nbsp; Don't interfere, I'll manage him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He's my child, and I can't have his spirit broken by harshness."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He's my child, and I won't have his temper spoiled by



<P>indulgence.&nbsp; Go down, my dear, and leave the boy to me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When John spoke in that masterful tone, Meg always obeyed,



<P>and never regretted her docility.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Please let me kiss him once, John?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Certainly.&nbsp; Demi, say good night to Mamma, and let her go and

rest,



<P>for she is very tired with taking care of you all day."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg always insisted upon it that the kiss won the victory,



<P>for after it was given, Demi sobbed more quietly, and lay quite



<P>still at the bottom of the bed, whither he had wriggled in his



<P>anguish of mind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Poor little man, he's worn out with sleep and crying.&nbsp; I'll



<P>cover him up, and then go and set Meg's heart at rest." thought



<P>John, creeping to the bedside, hoping to find his rebellious



<P>heir asleep.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But he wasn't, for the moment his father peeped at him,



<P>Demi's eyes opened, his little chin began to quiver, and he put



<P>up his arms, saying with a penitent hiccough, "Me's dood, now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sitting on the stairs outside Meg wondered at the long



<P>silence which followed the uproar, and after imagining all



<P>sorts of impossible accidents, she slipped into the room to



<P>set her fears at rest.&nbsp; Demi lay fast asleep, not in his usual



<P>spreadeagle attitude, but in a subdued bunch, cuddled close in



<P>the circle of his father's arm and holding his father's finger,



<P>as if he felt that justice was tempered with mercy, and had



<P>gone to sleep a sadder and wiser baby.&nbsp; So held, John had waited



<P>with a womanly patience till the little hand relaxed its hold,



<P>and while waiting had fallen asleep, more tired by that tussle



<P>with his son than with his whole day's work.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As Meg stood watching the two faces on the pillow, she



<P>smiled to herself, and then slipped away again, saying in a



<P>satisfied tone, "I never need fear that John will be too harsh



<P>with my babies.&nbsp; He does know how to manage them, and will be



<P>a great help, for Demi is getting too much for me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When John came down at last, expecting to find a pensive



<P>or reproachful wife, he was agreeably surprised to find Meg



<P>placidly trimming a bonnet, and to be greeted with the request



<P>to read something about the election, if he was not



<P>too tired.&nbsp; John saw in a minute that a revolution of some



<P>kind was going on, but wisely asked no questions, knowing



<P>that Meg was such a transparent little person, she couldn't



<P>keep a secret to save her life, and therefore the clue would



<P>soon appear.&nbsp; He read a long debate with the most amiable



<P>readiness and then explained it in his most lucid manner,



<P>while Meg tried to look deeply interested, to ask intelligent



<P>questions, and keep her thoughts from wandering from the



<P>state of the nation to the state of her bonnet.&nbsp; In her secret



<P>soul, however, she decided that politics were as bad as mathematics,



<P>and the the mission of politicians seemed to be calling



<P>each other names, but she kept these feminine ideas to herself,



<P>and when John paused, shook her head and said with what she



<P>thought diplomatic ambiguity, "Well, I really don't see what



<P>we are coming to."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>John laughed, and watched her for a minute, as she poised



<P>a pretty little preparation of lace and flowers on her hand,



<P>and regarded it with the genuine interest which his harangue



<P>had failed to waken.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She is trying to like politics for my sake, so I'll try and



<P>like millinery for hers, that's only fair," thought John the Just,



<P>adding aloud, "That's very pretty.&nbsp; Is it what you call a breakfast

cap?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear man, it's a bonnet!&nbsp;&nbsp; My very best go-to-concert-and-theater

bonnet."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I beg your pardon, it was so small, I naturally mistook



<P>it for one of the flyaway things you sometimes wear.



<P>How do you keep it on?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"These bits of lace are fastened under the chin with a rosebud, so."



<P>And Meg illustrated by putting on the bonnet and regarding



<P>him with an air of calm satisfaction that was irresistible.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's a love of a bonnet, but I prefer the face inside, for



<P>it looks young and happy again."&nbsp; And John kissed the smiling



<P>face, to the great detriment of the rosebud under the chin.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm glad you like it, for I want you to take me to one



<P>of the new concerts some night.&nbsp; I really need some music to



<P>put me in tune.&nbsp; Will you, please?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Of course I will, with all my heart, or anywhere else you



<P>like.&nbsp; You have been shut up so long, it will do you no end of



<P>good, and I shall enjoy it, of all things.&nbsp; What put it into



<P>your head, little mother?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I had a talk with Marmee the other day, and told



<P>her how nervous and cross and out of sorts I felt, and she



<P>said I needed change and less care, so Hannah is to help me



<P>with the children, and I'm to see to things about the house more,



<P>and now and then have a little fun, just to keep me from getting



<P>to be a fidgety, broken-down old woman before my time.&nbsp; It's



<P>only an experiment, John, and I want to try it for your sake



<P>as much as for mine, because I've neglected you shamefully



<P>lately, and I'm going to make home what it used to be, if I



<P>can.&nbsp; You don't object, I hope?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Never mind what John said, or what a very narrow escape



<P>the little bonnet had from utter ruin.&nbsp; All that we have any



<P>business to know is that John did not appear to object, judging



<P>from the changes which gradually took place in the house



<P>and its inmates.&nbsp; It was not all Paradise by any means, but



<P>everyone was better for the division of labor system.&nbsp; The



<P>children throve under the paternal rule, for accurate, stedfast



<P>John brought order and obedience into Babydom, while Meg



<P>recovered her spirits and composed her nerves by plenty of



<P>wholesome exercise, a little pleasure, and much confidential



<P>conversation with her sensible husband.&nbsp; Home grew homelike



<P>again, and John had no wish to leave it, unless he took Meg



<P>with him.&nbsp; The Scotts came to the Brookes' now, and everyone



<P>found the little house a cheerful place, full of happiness,



<P>content, and family love.&nbsp; Even Sallie Moffatt liked to go



<P>there.&nbsp; "It is always so quiet and pleasant here, it does me



<P>good, Meg," she used to say, looking about her with wistful



<P>eyes, as if trying to discover the charm, that she might use



<P>it in her great house, full of splendid lonliness, for there



<P>were no riotous, sunny-faced babies there, and Ned lived in



<P>a world of lis own, where there was no place for her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This household happiness did not come all at once, but



<P>John and Meg had found the key to it, and each year of Married



<P>life taught them how to use it, unlocking the treasuries



<P>of real home love and mutual helpfulness, which the poorest



<P>may possess, and the richest cannot buy.&nbsp; This is the sort



<P>of shelf on which young wives and mothers may consent to be



<P>laid, safe from the restless fret and fever of the world,



<P>finding loyal lovers in the little sons and daughters who



<P>cling to them, undaunted by sorrow, poverty, or age, walking



<P>side by side, through fair and stormy weather, with a faithful



<P>friend, who is, in the true sense of the good old Saxon word,



<P>the `house-band', and learning, as Meg learned, that a woman's



<P>happiest kingdom is home, her highest honor the art of ruling



<P>it not as a queen, but as a wise wife and mother.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, dear, how hard it does seem to take up our packs



<P>and go on," sighed Meg the morning after the party, for now



<P>the holidays were over, the week of merrymaking did not fit



<P>her for going on easily with the task she never liked.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wish it was Christmas or New Year's all the time.



<P>Wouldn't it be fun?" answered Jo, yawning dismally.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We shouldn't enjoy ourselves half so much as we do now.



<P>But it does seem so nice to have little suppers and bouquets,



<P>and go to parties, and drive home, and read and rest, and not



<P>work.&nbsp; It's like other people, you know, and I always envy



<P>girls who do such things, I'm so fond of luxury," said Meg,



<P>trying to decide which of two shabby gowns was the least



<P>shabby.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, we can't have it, so don't let us grumble but



<P>shoulder our bundles and trudge along as cheerfully as



<P>Marmee does.&nbsp; I'm sure Aunt March is a regular Old Man of



<P>the Sea to me, but I suppose when I've learned to carry her



<P>without complaining, she will tumble off, or get so light



<P>that I shan't mind her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This idea tickled Jo's fancy and put her in good spirits,



<P>but Meg didn't brighten, for her burden, consisting



<P>of four spoiled children, seemed heavier than ever.



<P>She had not heart enough even to make herself pretty



<P>as usual by putting on a blue neck ribbon and dressing



<P>her hair in the most becoming way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Where's the use of looking nice, when no one sees me



<P>but those cross midgets, and no one cares whether I'm pretty



<P>or not?" she muttered, shutting her drawer with a jerk.&nbsp; "I



<P>shall have to toil and moil all my days, with only little



<P>bits of fun now and then, and get old and ugly and sour,



<P>because I'm poor and can't enjoy my life as other girls do.



<P>It's a shame!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So Meg went down, wearing an injured look, and wasn't at



<P>all agreeable at breakfast time.&nbsp; Everyone seemed rather out



<P>of sorts and inclined to croak.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Beth had a headache and lay on the sofa, trying to comfort



<P>herself with the cat and three kittens.&nbsp; Amy was fretting



<P>because her lessons were not learned, and she couldn't



<P>find her rubbers.&nbsp; Jo would whistle and make a great racket



<P>getting ready.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. March was very busy trying to finish a letter,



<P>which must go at once, and Hannah had the grumps, for being



<P>up late didn't suit her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There never was such a cross family!" cried Jo, losing



<P>her temper when she had upset an inkstand, broken both boot



<P>lacings, and sat down upon her hat.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You're the crossest person in it!" returned Amy, washing



<P>out the sum that was all wrong with the tears that had



<P>fallen on her slate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Beth, if you don't keep these horrid cats down cellar



<P>I'll have them drowned," exclaimed Meg angrily as she tried



<P>to get rid of the kitten which had scrambled up her back and



<P>stuck like a burr just out of reach.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo laughed, Meg scolded, Beth implored, and Amy wailed



<P>because she couldn't remember how much nine times twelve was.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Girls, girls, do be quiet one minute!&nbsp; I must get this



<P>off by the early mail, and you drive me distracted with your



<P>worry," cried Mrs. March, crossing out the third spoiled sentence



<P>in her letter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a momentary lull, broken by Hannah, who stalked in,



<P>laid two hot turnovers on the table, and stalked out again.



<P>These turnovers were an institution, and the girls called



<P>them `muffs', for they had no others and found the hot



<P>pies very comforting to their hands on cold mornings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Hannah never forgot to make them, no matter how busy or



<P>grumpy she might be, for the walk was long and bleak.



<P>The poor things got no other lunch and were seldom home



<P>before two.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Cuddle your cats and get over your headache, Bethy.



<P>Goodbye, Marmee.&nbsp; We are a set of rascals this morning, but



<P>we'll come home regular angels.&nbsp; Now then, Meg!"&nbsp; And Jo



<P>tramped away, feeling that the pilgrims were not setting out



<P>as they ought to do.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They always looked back before turning the corner, for



<P>their mother was always at the window to nod and smile, and



<P>wave her hand to them.&nbsp; Somehow it seemed as if they couldn't



<P>have got through the day without that, for whatever their



<P>mood might be, the last glimpse of that motherly face was



<P>sure to affect them like sunshine.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If Marmee shook her fist instead of kissing her hand



<P>to us, it would serve us right, for more ungrateful wretches



<P>than we are were never seen," cried Jo, taking a remorseful



<P>satisfaction in the snowy walk and bitter wind.



<P>"Don't use such dreadful expressions," replied Meg from



<P>the depths of the veil in which she had shrouded herself



<P>like a nun sick of the world.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I like good strong words that mean something," replied



<P>Jo, catching her hat as it took a leap off her head



<P>preparatory to flying away altogether.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Call yourself any names you like, but I am neither a



<P>rascal nor a wretch and I don't choose to be called so."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You're a blighted being, and decidedly cross today because



<P>you can't sit in the lap of luxury all the time.&nbsp; Poor dear,



<P>just wait till I make my fortune, and you shall revel



<P>in carriages and ice cream and high-heeled slippers,



<P>and posies, and red-headed boys to dance with."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How ridiculous you are, Jo!"&nbsp; But Meg laughed at the



<P>nonsense and felt better in spite of herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Lucky for you I am, for if I put on crushed airs and



<P>tried to be dismal, as you do, we should be in a nice state.



<P>Thank goodness, I can always find something funny to keep me



<P>up.&nbsp; Don't croak any more, but come home jolly, there's a dear."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo gave her sister an encouraging pat on the shoulder



<P>as they parted for the day, each going a different way, each



<P>hugging her little warm turnover, and each trying to be



<P>cheerful in spite of wintry weather, hard work, and the



<P>unsatisfied desires of pleasure-loving youth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Mr. March lost his property in trying to help an



<P>unfortunate friend, the two oldest girls begged to be allowed



<P>to do something toward their own support, at least.&nbsp; Believing



<P>that they could not begin too early to cultivate energy,



<P>industry, and independence, their parents consented, and



<P>both fell to work with the hearty good will which in spite



<P>of all obstacles is sure to succeed at last.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Margaret found a place as nursery governess and felt



<P>rich with her small salary.&nbsp; As she said, she was `fond of



<P>luxury', and her chief trouble was poverty.&nbsp; She found it



<P>harder to bear than the others because she could remember a



<P>time when home was beautiful, life full of ease and pleasure,



<P>and want of any kind unknown.&nbsp; She tried not to be envious



<P>or discontented, but it was very natural that the young girl



<P>should long for pretty things, gay friends, accomplishments,



<P>and a happy life.&nbsp; At the Kings' she daily saw all she wanted,



<P>for the children's older sisters were just out, and Meg



<P>caught frequent glimpses of dainty ball dresses and bouquets,



<P>heard lively gossip about theaters, concerts, sleighing parties,



<P>and merrymakings of all kinds, and saw money lavished



<P>on trifles which would have been so precious to her.&nbsp; Poor



<P>Meg seldom complained, but a sense of injustice made her feel



<P>bitter toward everyone sometimes, for she had not yet learned



<P>to know how rich she was in the blessings which alone can



<P>make life happy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo happened to suit Aunt March, who was lame and needed



<P>an active person to wait upon her.&nbsp; The childless old lady



<P>had offered to adopt one of the girls when the troubles came,



<P>and was much offended because her offer was declined.&nbsp; Other



<P>friends told the Marches that they had lost all chance of



<P>being remembered in the rich old lady's will, but the



<P>unworldly Marches only said...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We can't give up our girls for a dozen fortunes.&nbsp; Rich



<P>or poor, we will keep together and be happy in one another."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The old lady wouldn't speak to them for a time, but happening



<P>to meet Jo at at a friend's, something in her comical face



<P>and blunt manners struck the old lady's fancy, and she



<P>proposed to take her for a companion.&nbsp; This did not suit Jo



<P>at all, but she accepted the place since nothing better



<P>appeared and, to every one's surprise, got on remarkably well



<P>with her irascible relative.&nbsp; There was an occasional tempest,



<P>and once Jo marched home, declaring she couldn't bear



<P>it longer, but Aunt March always cleared up quickly, and



<P>sent for her to come back again with such urgency that she



<P>could not refuse, for in her heart she rather liked the



<P>peppery old lady.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I suspect that the real attraction was a large library



<P>of fine books, which was left to dust and spiders since



<P>Uncle March died.&nbsp; Jo remembered the kind old gentleman, who



<P>used to let her build railroads and bridges with his big



<P>dictionaries, tell her stories about queer pictures in his



<P>Latin books, and buy her cards of gingerbread whenever he



<P>met her in the street.&nbsp; The dim, dusty room, with the busts



<P>staring down from the tall bookcases, the cozy chairs, the



<P>globes, and best of all, the wilderness of books in which



<P>she could wander where she liked, made the library a region



<P>of bliss to her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The moment Aunt March took her nap, or was busy with



<P>company, Jo hurried to this quiet place, and curling herself



<P>up in the easy chair, devoured poetry, romance, history,



<P>travels, and pictures like a regular bookworm.&nbsp; But, like



<P>all happiness, it did not last long, for as sure as she had



<P>just reached the heart of the story, the sweetest verse of



<P>a song, or the most perilous adventure of her traveler, a



<P>shrill voice called, "Josy-phine! Josy-phine! and she had



<P>to leave her paradise to wind yarn, wash the poodle, or



<P>read Belsham's Essays by the hour together.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo's ambition was to do something very splendid.&nbsp; What



<P>it was, she had no idea as yet, but left it for time to tell



<P>her, and meanwhile, found her greatest affliction in the



<P>fact that she couldn't read, run, and ride as much as she



<P>liked.&nbsp; A quick temper, sharp tongue, and restless spirit



<P>were always getting her into scrapes, and her life was a



<P>series of ups and downs, which were both comic and pathetic.



<P>But the training she received at Aunt March's was just what



<P>she needed, and the thought that she was doing something to



<P>support herself made her happy in spite of the perpetual



<P>"Josy-phine!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Beth was too bashful to go to school.It had been tried,



<P>but she suffered so much that it was given up, and she did



<P>her lessons at home with her father.&nbsp; Even when he went away,



<P>and her mother was called to devote her skill and energy to



<P>Soldiers' Aid Societies, Beth went faithfully on by herself



<P>and did the best she could.&nbsp; She was a housewifely little



<P>creature, and helped Hannah keep home neat and comfortable



<P>for the workers, never thinking of any reward but to be



<P>loved.&nbsp; Long, quiet days she spent, not lonely nor idle, for



<P>her little world was peopled with imaginary friends, and she



<P>was by nature a busy bee.&nbsp; There were six dolls to be taken



<P>up and dressed every morning, for Beth was a child still



<P>and and loved her pets as well as ever.&nbsp; Not one whole or



<P>handsome one among them, all were outcasts till Beth took



<P>them in, for when her sisters outgrew these idols, they



<P>passed to her because Amy would have nothing old or ugly.



<P>Beth cherished them all the more tenderly for that very



<P>reason, and set up a hospital for infirm dolls.&nbsp; No pins



<P>were ever stuck into their cotton vitals, no harsh words or



<P>blows were ever given them, no neglect ever saddened the



<P>heart or the most repulsive, but all were fed and clothed,



<P>nursed and caressed with an affection which never failed.



<P>One forlorn fragment of dollanity had belonged to Jo and,



<P>having led a tempestuous life, was left a wreck in the rag



<P>bag, from which dreary poorhouse it was rescued by Beth



<P>and taken to her refuge.&nbsp; Having no top to its head, she



<P>tied on a neat little cap, and as both arms and legs were



<P>gone, she hid these deficiencies by folding it in a blanket



<P>and devoting her best bed to this chronic invalid.&nbsp; If anyone



<P>had known the care lavished on that dolly, I think it



<P>would have touched their hearts, even while they laughed.



<P>She brought it bits of bouquets, she read to it, took it



<P>out to breathe fresh air, hidden under her coat, she sang



<P>it lullabies and never went to be without kissing its dirty



<P>face and whispering tenderly, "I hope you'll have a good



<P>night, my poor dear."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Beth had her troubles as well as the others, and not



<P>being an angel but a very human little girl, she often `wept



<P>a little weep' as Jo said, because she couldn't take music



<P>lessons and have a fine piano.&nbsp; She loved music so dearly,



<P>tried so hard to learn, and practiced away so patiently at



<P>the jingling old instrument, that it did seem as if someone



<P>(not to hint Aunt March) ought to help her.&nbsp; Nobody did,



<P>however, and nobody saw Beth wipe the tears off the yellow



<P>keys, that wouldn't keep in tune, when she was all alone.



<P>She sang like a little lark about her work, never was too



<P>tired for Marmee and the girls, and day after day said



<P>hopefully to herself," I know I'll get my music some time,



<P>if I'm good."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There are many Beths in the world, shy and quiet, sitting



<P>in corners till needed, and living for others so cheerfully



<P>that no one sees the sacrifices till the little cricket on



<P>the hearth stops chirping, and the sweet, sunshiny presence



<P>vanishes, leaving silence and shadow behind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If anybody had asked Amy what the greatest trial of her



<P>life was, she would have answered at once, "My nose."&nbsp; When



<P>she was a baby, Jo had accidently dropped her into the coal hod,



<P>and Amy insisted that the fall had ruined her nose forever.&nbsp; It



<P>was not big nor red, like poor `Petrea's', it was only rather



<P>flat, and all the pinching in the world could not give it an



<P>aristocratic point.&nbsp; No one minded it but herself, and it was



<P>doing its best to grow, but Amy felt deeply the want of a



<P>Grecian nose, and drew whole sheets of handsome ones to console



<P>herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Little Raphael," as her sisters called her, had a decided



<P>talent for drawing, and was never so happy as when copying



<P>flowers, designing fairies, or illustrating stories with queer



<P>specimens of art.&nbsp; Her teachers complained that instead of



<P>doing her sums she covered her slate with animals, the blank



<P>pages of her atlas were used to copy maps on, and caricatures



<P>of the most ludicrous description came fluttering out of all



<P>her books at unlucky moments.&nbsp; She got through her lessons as



<P>well as she could, and managed to escape reprimands by being



<P>a model of deportment.&nbsp; She was a great favorite with her mates,



<P>being good-tempered and possessing the happy art of pleasing



<P>without effort.&nbsp; Her little airs and graces were much admired,



<P>so were her accomplishments, for besides her drawing, she could



<P>play twelve tunes, crochet, and read French without mispronouncing



<P>more than two-thirds of the words.&nbsp; She had a plaintive



<P>way of saying, "When Papa was rich we did so-and-so," which



<P>was very touching, and her long words were considered `perfectly



<P>elegant' by the girls.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy was in a fair way to be spoiled, for everyone petted



<P>her, and her small vanities and selfishnesses were growing nicely.



<P>One thing, however, rather quenched the vanities.&nbsp; She had to wear



<P>her cousin's clothes.&nbsp; Now Florence's mama hadn't a particle of



<P>taste, and Amy suffered deeply at having to wear a red instead of



<P>a blue bonnet, unbecoming gowns, and fussy aprons that did not



<P>fit.&nbsp; Everything was good, well made, and little worn, but Amy's



<P>artistic eyes were much afflicted, especially this winter, when



<P>her school dress was a dull purple with yellow dots and no



<P>trimming.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My only comfort," she said to Meg, with tears in her eyes,



<P>"is that Mother doesn't take tucks in my dresses whenever I'm



<P>naughty, as Maria Parks's mother does.&nbsp; My dear, it's really



<P>dreadful, for sometimes she is so bad her frock is up to her



<P>knees, and she can't come to school.&nbsp; When I think of this



<P>deggerredation, I fell that I can bear even my flat nose and



<P>purple gown with yellow skyrockets on it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg was Amy's confidante and monitor, and by some strange



<P>attraction of opposites Jo was gentle Beth's.&nbsp; To Jo alone did



<P>the shy child tell her thoughts, and over her big harum-scarum



<P>sister Beth unconsciously exercised more influence than anyone



<P>in the family.&nbsp; The two older girls were a great deal to one



<P>another, but each took one of the younger sisters into her



<P>keeping and watched over her in her own way, `playing mother'



<P>they called it, and put their sisters in the places of



<P>discarded dolls with the maternal instinct of litte women.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Has anybody got anything to tell?&nbsp; It's been such a dismal



<P>day I'm really dying for some amusement," said Meg, as they sat



<P>sewing together that evening.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I had a queer time with Aunt today, and, as I got the best



<P>of it, I'll tell you about it," began Jo, who dearly loved to tell



<P>stories.&nbsp; "I was reading that everlasting Belsham, and droning



<P>away as I always do, for Aunt soon drops off, and then I take out



<P>some nice book, and read like fury till she wakes up.&nbsp; I actually



<P>made myself sleepy, and before she began to nod, I gave such a



<P>gape that she asked me what I meant by opening my mouth wide



<P>enough to take the whole book in at once.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wish I could, and be done with it," said I, trying not to



<P>be saucy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then she gave me a long lecture on my sins, and told me to



<P>sit and think them over while she just `lost' herself for a moment.



<P>She never finds herself very soon, so the minute her cap began to



<P>bob like a top-heavy dahlia, I whipped the VICAR OF WAKEFIELD out



<P>of my pocket, and read away, with one eye on him and one on Aunt.



<P>I'd just got to where they all tumbled into the water when I



<P>forgot and laughed out loud.&nbsp; Aunt woke up and, being more



<P>good-natured after her nap, told me to read a bit and show what



<P>frivolous work I preferred to the worthy and instructive Belsham.



<P>I did my very best, and she liked it, though she only said...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't understand what it's all about.&nbsp; Go back and begin



<P>it, child."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Back I went, and made the Primroses as interesting as ever I



<P>could.&nbsp; Once I was wicked enough to stop in a thrilling place,

and



<P>say meekly, "I'm afraid it tires you, ma'am.&nbsp; Shan't I stop now?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She caught up her knitting, which had dropped out of her



<P>hands, gave me a sharp look through her specs, and said, in her



<P>short way, `Finish the chapter, and don't be impertinent, miss'."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Did she own she liked it?" asked Meg.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, bless you, no!&nbsp; But she let old Belsham rest, and when I



<P>ran back after my gloves this afternoon, there she was, so hard at



<P>the Vicar that she didn't hear me laugh as I danced a jig in the hall



<P>because of the good time coming.&nbsp; What a pleasant life she might

have



<P>if only she chose!&nbsp; I don't envy her much, in spite of her money,

for



<P>after all rich people have about as many worries as poor ones, I



<P>think," added Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That reminds me," said Meg, "that I've got something to tell.



<P>It isn't funny, like Jo's story, but I thought about it a good deal



<P>as I came home.&nbsp; At the Kings' today I found everybody in a flurry,



<P>and one of the children said that her oldest brother had done



<P>something dreadful, and Papa had sent him away.&nbsp; I heard Mrs. King



<P>crying and Mr. King talking very loud, and Grace and Ellen turned



<P>away their faces when they passed me, so I shouldn't see how red and



<P>swollen their eyes were.&nbsp; I didn't ask any questions, of course,

but



<P>I felt so sorry for them and was rather glad I hadn't any wild



<P>brothers to do wicked things and disgrace the family."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think being disgraced in school is a great deal tryinger



<P>than anything bad boys can do," said Amy, shaking her head, as if



<P>her experience of life had been a deep one.&nbsp; "Susie Perkins came



<P>to school today with a lovely red carnelian ring.&nbsp; I wanted it



<P>dreadfully, and wished I was her with all my might.&nbsp; Well, she



<P>drew a picture of Mr. Davis, with a monstrous nose and a hump,



<P>and the words, `Young ladies, my eye is upon you!' coming out of



<P>his mouth in a balloon thing.&nbsp; We were laughing over it when all



<P>of a sudden his eye was on us, and he ordered Susie to bring up



<P>her slate.&nbsp; She was parrylized with fright, but she went, and oh,



<P>what do you think he did?&nbsp; He took her by the ear--the ear!&nbsp;

Just



<P>fancy how horrid!--and led her to the recitation platform, and



<P>made her stand there half and hour, holding the slate so everyone



<P>could see."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Didn't the girls laugh at the picture?" asked Jo, who



<P>relished the scrape.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Laugh? Not one! They sat still as mice, and Susie cried



<P>quarts, I know she did.&nbsp; I didn't envy her then, for I felt that



<P>millions of carnelian rings wouldn't have made me happy after that.



<P>I never, never should have got over such a agonizing mortification."



<P>And Amy went on with her work, in the proud consciousness of virtue



<P>and the successful utterance of two long words in a breath.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I saw something I liked this morning, and I meant to tell it



<P>at dinner, but I forgot," said Beth, putting Jo's topsy-turvy basket



<P>in order as she talked.&nbsp; "When I went to get some oysters for Hannah,



<P>Mr. Laurence was in the fish shop, but he didn't see me, for I kept



<P>behind the fish barrel, and he was busy with Mr. Cutter the fishman.



<P>A poor woman came in with a pail a mop, and asked Mr. Cutter if he



<P>would let her do some scrubbing for a bit of fish, because she



<P>hadn't any dinner for her children, and had been disappointed of a



<P>day's work.&nbsp; Mr. Cutter was in a hurry and said `No', rather



<P>crossly, so she was going away, looking hungry and sorry, when Mr.



<P>Laurence hooked up a big fish with the crooked end of his cane and



<P>held it out to her.&nbsp; She was so glad and surprised she took it



<P>right into her arms, and thanked him over and over.&nbsp; He told her

to



<P>`go along and cook it', and she hurried off, so happy!&nbsp; Wasn't

it



<P>good of him?&nbsp; Oh, she did look so funny, hugging the big, slippery



<P>fish, and hoping Mr. Laurence's bed in heaven would be `aisy'."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When they had laughed at Beth's story, they asked their mother



<P>for one, and after a moments thought, she said soberly, "As I sat



<P>cutting out blue flannel jackets today at the rooms, I felt very



<P>anxious about Father, and thought how lonely and helpless we should



<P>be , if anything happened to him.&nbsp; It was not a wise thing to do,



<P>but I kept on worrying till an old man came in with an order for some



<P>clothes.&nbsp; He sat down near me, and I began to talk to him, for

he



<P>looked poor and tired and anxious.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"`Have you sons in the army?' I asked, for the note he brought



<P>was not to me.



<P>"Yes, ma'am.&nbsp; I had four, but two were killed, one is a prisoner,



<P>and I'm going to the other, who is very sick in a Washington hospital.'



<P>he answered quietly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"`You have done a great deal for your country, sir, ' I said,



<P>feeling respect now, instead of pity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"`Not a mite more than I ought, ma'am.&nbsp; I'd go myself, if I was



<P>any use.&nbsp; As I ain't, I give my boys, and give 'em free.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He spoke so cheerfully, looked so sincere, and seemed so glad



<P>to give his all, that I was ashamed of myself.&nbsp; I'd given one man

and



<P>thought it too much, while he gave four without grudging them.&nbsp;

I had



<P>all my girls to comfort me at home, and his last son was waiting,



<P>miles away, to say good-by to him, perhaps!&nbsp; I felt so rich, so

happy



<P>thinking of my blessings, that I made him a nice bundle, gave him



<P>some money, and thanked him heartily for the lesson he had taught me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Tell another story, Mother, one with a moral to it, like this.



<P>I like to think about them afterward, if they are real and not too



<P>preachy," said Jo, after a minute's silence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. March smiled and began at once, for she had told stories to



<P>this little audience for many years, and knew how to please them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Once upon a time, there were four girls, who had enough to eat



<P>and drink and wear, a good many comforts and pleasures, kind friends



<P>and parents who loved them dearly, and yet they were not contented."



<P>(Here the listeners stole sly looks at one another, and began to sew

diligently.) "These girls were



<P>anxious to be good and made many



<P>excellent resolutions, but they did not keep them very well, and were



<P>constantly saying, `If only we had this, ' or `If we could only do



<P>that, ' quite forgetting how much they already had, and how many



<P>things they actually could do.&nbsp; So they asked an old woman what

spell



<P>they could use to make them happy, and she said, `When you feel



<P>discontented, think over your blessings, and be grateful.'" (Here Jo



<P>looked up quickly, as if about to speak, but changed her mind, seeing



<P>that the story was not done yet.)

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Being sensible girls, they decided to try her advice, and soon



<P>were surprised to see how well off they were.&nbsp; One discovered that



<P>money couldn't keep shame and sorrow out of rich people's houses,



<P>another that, though she was poor, she was a great deal happier, with



<P>her youth, health, and good spirits, than a certain fretful, feeble



<P>old lady who couldn't enjoy her comforts, a third that, disagreeable



<P>as it was to help get dinner, it was harder still to go begging for



<P>it and the fourth, that even carnelian rings were not so valuable as



<P>good behavior.&nbsp; So they agreed to stop complaining, to enjoy the



<P>blessings already possessed, and try to deserve them, lest they



<P>should be taken away entirely, instead of increased, and I believe



<P>they were never disappointed or sorry that they took the old woman's



<P>advice."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now, Marmee, that is very cunning of you to turn our own



<P>stories against us, and give us a sermon instead of a romance!"



<P>cried Meg.



<P>"I like that kind of sermon.&nbsp; It's the sort Father used to tell



<P>us," said Beth thoughtfully, putting the needles straight on Jo's



<P>cushion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't complain near as much as the others do, and I shall be



<P>more careful than ever now, for I've had warning from Susies's downfall,"



<P>said Amy morally.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We needed that lesson, and we won't forget it.&nbsp; If we do so,



<P>you just say to us, as old Chloe did in UNCLE TOM, `Tink ob yer



<P>marcies, chillen! `Tink ob yer marcies!'" added Jo, who could not,



<P>for the life of her, help getting a morsel of fun out of the little



<P>sermon, though she took it to heart as much as any of them.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As spring came on, a new set of amusements became the



<P>fashion, and the lengthening days gave long afternoons for



<P>work and play of all sorts.&nbsp; The garden had to be put in order,



<P>and each sister had a quarter of the little plot to do what she



<P>liked with.&nbsp; Hannah used to say, "I'd know which each of them



<P>gardings belonged to, ef I see 'em in Chiny," and so she might,



<P>for the girls' tastes differed as much as their characters.&nbsp; Meg's



<P>had roses and heliotrope, myrtle, and a little orange tree in it.



<P>Jo's bed was never alike two seasons, for she was always trying



<P>experiments.&nbsp; This year it was to be a plantation of sun flowers,



<P>the seeds of which cheerful land aspiring plant were to feed



<P>Aunt Cockle-top and her family of chicks.&nbsp; Beth had old-fashioned



<P>fragrant flowers in her garden, sweet peas and mignonette,



<P>larkspur, pinks, pansies, and southernwood, with chickweed for



<P>the birds and catnip for the pussies.&nbsp; Amy had a bower in hers,



<P>rather small and earwiggy, but very pretty to look at, with



<P>honeysuckle and morning-glories hanging their colored horns and



<P>bells in graceful wreaths all over it, tall white lilies, delicate



<P>ferns, and as many brilliant, picturesque plants as would consent



<P>to blossom there.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Gardening, walks, rows on the river, and flower hunts employed



<P>the fine days, and for rainy ones, they had house diversions,



<P>some old, some new, all more or less original.&nbsp; One of these



<P>was the `P.C', for as secret societies were the fashion,



<P>it was thought proper to have one, and as all of the girls



<P>admired Dickens, they called themselves the Pickwick Club.&nbsp; With



<P>a few interruptions, they had kept this up for a year, and met



<P>every Saturday evening in the big garret, on which occasions the



<P>ceremonies were as follows:&nbsp; Three chairs were arranged in a row



<P>before a table on which was a lamp, also four white badges, with



<P>a big `P.C.' in different colors on each, and the weekly



<P>newspaper called, The Pickwick Portfolio, to which all contributed



<P>something, while Jo, who reveled in pens and ink, was the editor.



<P>At seven o'clock, the four members ascended to the clubroom,



<P>tied their badges round their heads, and took their seats with



<P>great solemnity.&nbsp; Meg, as the eldest, was Samuel Pickwick, Jo,



<P>being of a literary turn, Augustus Snodgrass, Beth, because she



<P>was round and rosy, Tracy Tupman, and Amy, who was always trying



<P>to do what she couldn't, was Nathaniel Winkle.&nbsp; Pickwick, the



<P>president, read the paper, which was filled with original tales,



<P>poetry, local news, funny advertisements, and hints, in which



<P>they good-naturedly reminded each other of their faults and



<P>short comings.&nbsp; On one occasion, Mr. Pickwick put on a pair



<P>of spectacles without any glass, rapped upon the table, hemmed,



<P>and having stared hard at Mr. Snodgrass, who was tilting back



<P>in his chair, till he arranged himself properly, began to read:

<P>POET'S CORNER

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>ANNIVERSARY ODE

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Again we meet to celebrate



<P>With badge and solemn rite,



<P>Our fifty-second anniversary,



<P>In Pickwick Hall, tonight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>We all are here in perfect health,



<P>None gone from our small band:



<P>Again we see each well-known face,



<P>And press each friendly hand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Our Pickwick, always at his post,



<P>With reverence we greet,



<P>As, spectacles on nose, he reads



<P>Our well-filled weekly sheet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Although he suffers from a cold,



<P>We joy to hear him speak,



<P>For words of wisdom from him fall,



<P>In spite of croak or squeak.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Old six-foot Snodgrass looms on high,



<P>With elephantine grace,



<P>And beams upon the company,



<P>With brown and jovial face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Poetic fire lights up his eye,



<P>He struggles 'gainst his lot.



<P>Behold ambition on his brow,



<P>And on his nose, a blot.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Next our peaceful Tupman comes,



<P>So rosy, plump, and sweet,



<P>Who chokes with laughter at the puns,



<P>And tumbles off his seat.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Prim little Winkle too is here,



<P>With every hair in place,



<P>A model of propriety,



<P>Though he hates to wash his face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The year is gone, we still unite



<P>To joke and laugh and read,



<P>And tread the path of literature



<P>That doth to glory lead.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Long may our paper prosper well,



<P>Our club unbroken be,



<P>And coming years their blessings pour



<P>On the useful, gay `P.&nbsp; C.'.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>THE MASKED MARRIAGE



<P>(A Tale Of Venice)

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Gondola after gondola swept up to the marble



<P>steps, and left its lovely load to swell the



<P>brilliant throng that filled the stately halls of Count



<P>Adelon.&nbsp; Knights and ladies, elves and pages, monks



<P>and flower girls, all mingled gaily in the dance.



<P>Sweet voices and rich melody filled the air, and so



<P>with mirth and music the masquerade went on.



<P>"Has your Highness seen the Lady viola tonight?"



<P>asked a gallant troubadour of the fairy queen who



<P>floated down the hall upon his arm.



<P>"Yes, is she not lovely, though so sad!&nbsp; Her



<P>dress is well chosen, too, for in a week she weds



<P>Count Antonio, whom she passionately hates."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"By my faith, I envy him.&nbsp; Yonder he comes,



<P>arrayed like a bridegroom, except the black mask.



<P>When that is off we shall see how he regards the



<P>fair maid whose heart he cannot win, though her



<P>stern father bestows her hand," returned the troubadour.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Tis whispered that she loves the young English



<P>artist who haunts her steps, and is spurned by the



<P>old Count," said the lady, as they joined the dance.



<P>The revel was at its height when a priest



<P>appeared, and withdrawing the young pair to an alcove,



<P>hung with purple velvet, he motioned them to kneel.



<P>Instant silence fell on the gay throng, and not a



<P>sound, but he dash of fountains or the rustle of



<P>orange groves sleeping in the moonlight, broke the



<P>hush, as Count de Adelon spoke thus:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My lords and ladies, pardon the ruse by which



<P>I have gathered you here to witness the marriage of



<P>my daughter.&nbsp; Father, we wait your services."



<P>All eyes turned toward the bridal party, and a



<P>murmur of amazement went through the throng, for



<P>neither bride nor groom removed their masks.&nbsp; Curiosity



<P>and wonder possessed all hearts, but respect restrained



<P>all tongues till the holy rite was over.&nbsp; Then the



<P>eager spectators gathered round the count, demanding



<P>an explanation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Gladly would I give it if I could, but I only



<P>know that it was the whim of my timid Viola, and I



<P>yielded to it.&nbsp; Now, my children, let the play end.



<P>Unmask and receive my blessing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But neither bent the knee, for the young bridegroom



<P>replied in a tone that startled all listeners



<P>as the mask fell, disclosing the noble face of Ferdinand



<P>Devereux, the artist lover, and leaning on the



<P>breast where now flashed the star of an English earl



<P>was the lovely Viola, radiant with joy and beauty.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My lord, you scornfully bade me claim your



<P>daughter when I could boast as high a name and vast a



<P>fortune as the Count antonio.&nbsp; I can do more, for even



<P>your ambitious soul cannot refuse the Earl of Devereux



<P>and De Vere, when he gives his ancient name and boundless



<P>wealth in return for the beloved hand of this fair lady,



<P>now my wife.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The count stood like one changed to stone, and



<P>turning to the bewildered crowd, Ferdinand added, with



<P>a gay smile of triumph, "To you, my gallant friends, I



<P>can only wish that your wooing may prosper as mine has



<P>done, and that you may all win as fair a bride as I have



<P>by this masked marriage."

<P>THE HISTORY OF A SQUASH

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>_____

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Once upon a time a farmer planted a little seed.



<P>in his garden, and after a while it sprouted and became



<P>a vine and bore many squashes.&nbsp; One day in October,



<P>when they were ripe, he picked one and took it



<P>to market.&nbsp; A gorcerman bought and put it in his shop.



<P>That same morning, a little girl in a brown hat



<P>and blue dress, with a round face and snub nose, went



<P>and bought it for her mother.&nbsp; She lugged it home, cut



<P>it up, and boiled it in the big pot, mashed some of it



<P>salt and butter, for dinner.&nbsp; And to the rest she added



<P>a pint of milk, two eggs, four spoons of sugar, nutmeg,



<P>and some crackers, put it in a deep dish, and baked it



<P>till it was brown and nice, and next day it was eaten



<P>by a family named March.

<P>A SAD ACCIDENT

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On Friday last, we were startled by a violent shock



<P>in our basement, followed by cries of distress.



<P>On rushing in a body to the cellar, we discovered our beloved



<P>President prostrate upon the floor, having tripped and



<P>fallen while getting wood for domestic purposes.&nbsp; A perfect



<P>scene of ruin met our eyes, for in his fall Mr. Pickwick



<P>had plunged his head and shoulders into a tub of water,



<P>upset a keg of soft soap upon his manly form,&nbsp; and torn



<P>his garments badly.&nbsp; On being removed from this perilous



<P>situation, it was discovered that he had suffered



<P>no injury but several bruises, and we are happy to add,



<P>is now doing well.



<P>ED.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>THE PUBLIC BEREAVEMENT

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It is our painful duty to record the sudden and



<P>mysterious disappearance of our cherished friend, Mrs.



<P>Snowball Pat Paw.&nbsp; This lovely and beloved cat was the



<P>pet of a large circle of warm and admiring friends; for



<P>her beauty attracted all eyes, her graces and virtues



<P>endeared her to all hearts, and her loss is deeply felt



<P>by the whole community.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When last seen, she was sitting at the gate, watching



<P>the butcher's cart, and it is feared that some villain,



<P>tempted by her charms, basely stole her.&nbsp; Weeks have passed,



<P>but no trace of her has been discovered, and we relinquish



<P>all hope, tie a black ribbon to her basket, set aside her



<P>dish, and weep for her as one lost to us forever.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A sympathizing friend sends the following gem:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A LAMENT



<P>(FOR S.&nbsp; B.&nbsp; PAT PAW)

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>We mourn the loss of our little pet,



<P>And sigh o'er her hapless fate,



<P>For never more by the fire she'll sit,



<P>Nor play by the old green gate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The little grave where her infant sleeps



<P>Is 'neath the chestnut tree.



<P>But o'er her grave we may not weep,



<P>We know not where it may be.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her empty bed, her idle ball,



<P>Will never see her more;



<P>No gentle tap, no loving purr



<P>Is heard at the parlor door.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Another cat comes after her mice,



<P>A cat with a dirty face,



<P>But she does not hunt as our darling did,



<P>Nor play with her airy grace.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her stealthy paws tread the very hall



<P>Where Snowball used to play,



<P>But she only spits at the dogs our pet



<P>So gallantly drove away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She is useful and mild, and does her best,



<P>But she is not fair to see,



<P>And we cannot give her your place dear,



<P>Nor worship her as we worship thee.



<P>A.S.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As the President finished reading the paper (which I beg



<P>leave to assure my readers is a bona fide copy of one written



<P>by bona fide girls once upon a time), a round of applause



<P>followed, and then Mr. Snodgrass rose to make a proposition.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr. President and gentlemen," he began, assuming a



<P>parliamentary attitude and tone, "I wish to propose the admission



<P>of a new member--one who highly deserves the honor, would be



<P>deeply grateful for it, and would add immensely to the spirit



<P>of the club, the literary value of the paper, and be no end



<P>jolly and nice.&nbsp; I propose Mr. Theodore Laurence as an honorary



<P>member of the P.&nbsp; C.&nbsp; Come now, do have him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo's sudden change of tone made the girls laugh, but all



<P>looked rather anxious, and no one said a word as Snodgrass



<P>took his seat.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We'll put it to a vote," said the President.&nbsp; "All in



<P>favor of this motion please to manifest it by saying, `Aye'."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Contrary-minded say, `No'."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg and Amy were contrary-minded, and Mr. Winkle rose to



<P>say with great elegance, "We don't wish any boys, they only



<P>joke and bounce about.&nbsp; This is a ladies' club, and we wish to



<P>be private and proper."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm afraid he'll laugh at our paper, and make fun of us



<P>afterward," observed Pickwick, pulling the little curl on her



<P>forehead, as she always did when doubtful.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Up rose Snodgrass, very much in earnest.&nbsp; "Sir, I give you



<P>my word as a gentleman, Laurie won't do anything of the sort.&nbsp;

He



<P>likes to write, and he'll give a tone to our contributions and



<P>keep us from being sentimental, don't you see?&nbsp; We can do so little



<P>for him, and he does so much for us, I think the least we can do



<P>is to offer him a place here, and make him welcome if he comes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This artful allusion to benefits conferred brought Tupman to



<P>his feet, looking as if he had quite made up his mind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, we ought to do it, even if we are afraid.&nbsp; I say he may



<P>come, and his grandpa, too, if he likes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This spirited burst from Beth electrified the club, and Jo



<P>left her seat to shake hands approvingly.&nbsp; "Now then, vote again.



<P>Everybody remember it's our Laurie, and say, `Aye!'"



<P>cried Snodgrass excitedly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Aye!&nbsp; Aye!&nbsp; Aye!" replied three voices at once.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Good!&nbsp; Bless you!&nbsp; Now, as there's nothing like `taking time



<P>by the fetlock', as Winkle characteristically observes, allow me



<P>to present the new member."&nbsp; And, to the dismay of the rest of

the



<P>club, Jo threw open the door of the closet, and displayed Laurie



<P>sitting on a rag bag, flushed and twinkling with suppressed laughter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You rogue!&nbsp; You traitor!&nbsp; Jo, how could you?" cried the three



<P>girls, as Snodgrass led her friend triumphantly forth, and producing



<P>both a chair and a badge, installed him in a jiffy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The coolness of you two rascals is amazing," began Mr. Pickwick,



<P>trying to get up an awful frown and only succeeding in producing



<P>an amiable smile.&nbsp; But the new member was equal to the occasion,



<P>and rising, with a grateful salutation to the Chair, said



<P>in the most engaging manner, "Mr. President and ladies--I beg pardon,



<P>gentlemen--allow me to introduce myself as Sam Weller, the very



<P>humble servant of the club."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Good!&nbsp; Good!" cried Jo, pounding with the handle of the old



<P>warming pan on which she leaned.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My faithful friend and noble patron," continued Laurie with



<P>a wave of the hand, "who has so flatteringly presented me, is not



<P>to be blamed for the base stratagem of tonight.&nbsp; I planned it,

and



<P>she only gave in after lots of teasing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Come now, don't lay it all on yourself.&nbsp; You know I proposed



<P>the cupboard," broke in Snodgrass, who was enjoying the joke



<P>amazingly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Never mind what she says.&nbsp; I'm the wretch that did it, sir,"



<P>said the new member, with a Welleresque nod to Mr. Pickwick.&nbsp; "But



<P>on my honor, I never will do so again, and henceforth devote myself



<P>to the interest of this immortal club."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hear!&nbsp; Hear!" cried Jo, clashing the lid of the warming pan



<P>like a cymbal.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Go on, go on!" added Winkle and Tupman, while the President



<P>bowed benignly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I merely wish to say, that as a slight token of my gratitude



<P>for the honor done me, and as a means of promoting friendly relations



<P>between adjoining nations, I have set up a post office in the hedge



<P>in the lower corner of the garden, a fine, spacious building with



<P>padlocks on the doors and every convenience for the mails, also the



<P>females, if I may be allowed the expression.&nbsp; It's the old martin



<P>house, but I've stopped up the door and made the roof open, so it



<P>will hold all sorts of things, and save our valuable time.&nbsp; Letters,



<P>manuscripts, books, and bundles can be passed in there, and as each



<P>nation has a key, it will be uncommonly nice, I fancy.&nbsp; Allow me

to



<P>present the club key, and with many thanks for your favor, take my



<P>seat."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Great applause as Mr. Weller deposited a little key on the



<P>table and subsided, the warming pan clashed and waved wildly, and



<P>it was some time before order could be restored.&nbsp; A long discussion



<P>followed, and everyone came out surprising, for everyone did her



<P>best.&nbsp; So it was an unusually lively meeting, and did not adjourn



<P>till a late hour, when it broke up with three shrill cheers for the



<P>new member.&nbsp; No one ever regretted the admittance of Sam Weller,

for



<P>a more devoted, well-behaved, and jovial member no club could have.



<P>He certainly did add `spirit' to the meetings, and `a tone' to the



<P>paper, for his orations convulsed his hearers and his contributions



<P>were excellent, being patriotic, classical, comical, or dramatic,



<P>but never sentimental.&nbsp; Jo regarded them as worthy of Bacon, Milton,



<P>or Shakespeare, and remodeled her own works with good effect, she



<P>thought.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The P. O. was a capital little institution, and flourished



<P>wonderfully, for nearly as many queer things passed through it as



<P>through the real post office.&nbsp; Tragedies and cravats, poetry and



<P>pickles, garden seeds and long letters, music and gingerbread,



<P>rubbers, invitations, scoldings, and puppies.&nbsp; The old gentleman



<P>liked the fun, and amused himself by sending odd bundles,



<P>mysterious messages, and funny telegrams, and his gardener, who was



<P>smitten with Hannah's charms, actually sent a love letter to Jo's



<P>care.&nbsp; How they laughed when the secret came out, never dreaming



<P>how many love letters that little post office would hold in the



<P>years to come.

<P>"The first of June!&nbsp; The Kings are off to the seashore tomorrow,



<P>and I'm free.&nbsp; Three months' vacation--how I shall enjoy it!"



<P>exclaimed Meg, coming home one warm day to find Jo laid



<P>upon the sofa in an unusual state of exhaustion, while Beth took



<P>off her dusty boots, and Amy made lemonade for the refreshment



<P>of the whole party.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Aunt March went today, for which, oh, be joyful!" said Jo.



<P>"I was mortally afraid she'd ask me to go with her.&nbsp; If she



<P>had, I should have felt as if I ought to do it, but Plumfield is



<P>about as gay as a churchyard, you know, and I'd rather be excused.



<P>We had a flurry getting the old lady off, and I had a fright every



<P>time she spoke to me, for I was in such a hurry to be through that



<P>I was uncommonly helpful and sweet, and feared she'd find it



<P>impossible to part from me.&nbsp; I quaked till she was fairly in the



<P>carriage, and had a final fright, for as it drove of, she popped



<P>out her head, saying, `Josyphine, won't you--?' I didn't hear any



<P>more, for I basely turned and fled.&nbsp; I did actually run, and



<P>whisked round the corner whee I felt safe."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Poor old Jo!&nbsp; She came in looking as if bears were after her,"



<P>said Beth, as she cuddled her sister's feet with a motherly air.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Aunt March is a regular samphire, is she not?" observed Amy,



<P>tasting her mixture critically.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She means vampire, not seaweed, but it doesn't matter.&nbsp; It's



<P>too warm to be particular about one's parts of speech," murmured



<P>Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What shall you do all your vacation?" asked Amy, changing



<P>the subject with tact.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall lie abed late, and do nothing," replied Meg, from



<P>the depths of the rocking chair.&nbsp; "I've been routed up early all



<P>winter and had to spend my days working for other people, so now



<P>I'm going to rest and revel to my heart's content."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No," said Jo, "that dozy way wouldn't suit me.&nbsp; I've laid



<P>in a heap of books, and I'm going to improve my shining hours



<P>reading on my perch in the old apple tree, when I'm not having



<P>l..."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't say `larks!'" implored Amy, as a return snub for the



<P>samphire' correction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll say `nightingales' then, with Laurie.&nbsp; That's proper



<P>and appropriate, since he's a warbler."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't let us do any lessons, Beth, for a while, but play



<P>all the time and rest, as the girls mean to," proposed Amy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I will, if Mother doesn't mind.&nbsp; I want to learn some



<P>new songs, and my children need fitting up for the summer.&nbsp; They



<P>are dreadfully out of order and really suffering for clothes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"May we, Mother?" asked Meg, turning to Mrs. March, who



<P>sat sewing in what they called `Marmee's corner'.



<P>"You may try your experiment for a week and see how you like



<P>it.&nbsp; I think by Saturday night you will find that all play and

no



<P>work is as bad as all work and no play."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, dear, no!&nbsp; It will be delicious, I'm sure," said Meg



<P>complacently.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I now propose a toast, as my `friend and pardner,



<P>Sairy Gamp', says.&nbsp; Fun forever, and no grubbing!"



<P>cried Jo, rising, glass in hand, as the lemonade went round.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They all drank it merrily, and began the experiment by



<P>lounging for the rest of the day.&nbsp; Next morning, Meg did not



<P>appear till ten o'clock.&nbsp; Her solitary breakfast did not taste



<P>nice, and the room seemed lonely and untidy, for Jo had not



<P>filled the vases, Beth had not dusted, and Amy's books lay



<P>scattered about.&nbsp; Nothing was neat and pleasant but `Marmee's



<P>corner', which looked as usual.&nbsp; And there Meg sat, to `rest and



<P>read', which meant to yawn and imagine what pretty summer dresses



<P>she would get with her salary.&nbsp; Jo spent the morning on the river



<P>with Laurie and the afternoon reading and crying over The Wide,



<P>Wide World, up in the apple tree.&nbsp; Beth began by rummaging everything



<P>out of the big closet where her family resided, but getting



<P>tired before half done, she left her establishment topsy-turvy



<P>and went to her music, rejoicing that she had no dishes to wash.



<P>Amy arranged her bower, put on her best white frock, smoothed her



<P>curls, and sat down to draw under the honeysuckle, hoping someone



<P>would see and inquire who the young artist was.&nbsp; As no one appeared



<P>but an inquisitive daddy-longlegs, who examined her work with interest,



<P>she went to walk, got caught in a shower, and came home dripping.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At teatime they compared notes, and all agreed that it had



<P>been a delightful, though unusually long day.&nbsp; Meg, who went shopping



<P>in the afternoon and got a `sweet blue muslin, had discovered,



<P>after she had cut the breadths off, that it wouldn't wash, which



<P>mishap made her slightly cross.&nbsp; Jo had burned the skin off her



<P>nose boating, and got a raging headache by reading too long.&nbsp; Beth



<P>was worried by the confusion of her closet and the difficulty of



<P>learning three or four songs at once, and Amy deeply regretted the



<P>damage done her frock, for Katy Brown's party was to be the next



<P>day and now like Flora McFlimsey, she had `nothing to wear'.&nbsp; But



<P>these were mere trifles, and they assured their mother that the



<P>experiment was working finely.&nbsp; She smiled, said nothing, and with



<P>Hannah's help did their neglected work, keeping home pleasant and



<P>the domestic machinery running smoothly.&nbsp; It was astonishing what



<P>a peculiar and uncomfortable state of things was produced by the



<P>`resting and reveling' process.&nbsp; The days kept getting longer and



<P>longer, the weather was unusually variable and so were tempers, and



<P>unsettled feeling possessed everyone, and Satan found plenty of



<P>mischief for the idle hands to do.&nbsp; As the height of luxury, Meg



<P>put out some of her sewing, and then found time hang so heavily that



<P>she fell to snipping and spoiling her clothes in her attempts to



<P>furbish them up a`la Moffat.&nbsp; Jo read till her eyes gave out and



<P>she was sick of books, got so fidgety that even good-natured Laurie



<P>had a quarrel with her, and so reduced in spirits that she desperately



<P>wished she had gone with Aunt March.&nbsp; Beth got on pretty well,



<P>for she was constantly forgetting that it was to be all play and



<P>no work, and fell back into her old ways now and then.&nbsp; But something



<P>in the air affected her, and more than once her tranquility was much



<P>disturbed, so much so that on one occasion she actually shook poor



<P>dear Joanna and told her she was a fright'.&nbsp; Amy fared worst of

all,



<P>for her resources were small, and when her sisters left her to amuse



<P>herself, she soon found that accomplished and important little self



<P>a great burden.&nbsp; She didn't like dolls, fairy tales were childish,



<P>and one couldn't draw all the time.&nbsp; Tea parties didn't amount

to



<P>much neither did picnics unless very well conducted.&nbsp; "If one could



<P>have a fine house, full of nice girls, or go traveling, the summer



<P>would be delightful, but to stay at home with three selfish sisters



<P>and a grown-up boy was enough to try the patience of a Boaz,"



<P>complained Miss Malaprop, after several days devoted to pleasure,



<P>fretting, and ennui.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>No one would own that they were tired of the experiment, but



<P>by Friday night each acknowledged to herself that she was glad the



<P>week was nearly done.&nbsp; Hoping to impress the lesson more deeply,



<P>Mrs. March, who had a good deal of humor, resolved to finish off



<P>the trial in an appropriate manner, so she gave Hannah a holiday and



<P>let the girls enjoy the full effect of the play system.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When they got up on Saturday morning, there was no fire in



<P>the kitchen, no breakfast in the dining room, and no mother



<P>anywhere to be seen.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mercy on us!&nbsp; What has happened?" cried Jo, staring about



<P>her in dismay.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg ran upstairs and soon came back again, looking relieved



<P>but rather bewildered, and a little ashamed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mother isn't sick, only very tired, and she says she is



<P>going to stay quietly in her room all day and let us do the best



<P>we can.&nbsp; It's a very queer thing for her to do, she doesn't act



<P>a bit like herself.&nbsp; But she says it has been a hard week for



<P>her, so we mustn't grumble but take care of ourselves."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's easy enough, and I like the idea, I'm aching for



<P>something to do, that is, some new amusement, you know," added



<P>Jo quickly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In fact it was an immense relief to them all to have a little



<P>work, and they took hold with a will, but soon realized the truth



<P>of Hannah's saying, "Housekeeping ain't no joke."&nbsp; There was plenty



<P>of food in the larder, and while Beth and Amy set the table, Meg and



<P>Jo got breakfast, wondering as they did why servants ever talked



<P>about hard work.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall take some up to Mother, though she said we were not



<P>to think of her, for she'd take care of herself," said Meg, who



<P>presided and felt quite matronly behind the teapot.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So a tray was fitted out before anyone began, and taken up



<P>with the cook's compliments.&nbsp; The boiled tea was very bitter, the



<P>omelet scorched, and the biscuits speckled with saleratus, but



<P>Mrs. March received her repast with thanks and laughed heartily



<P>over it after Jo was gone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Poor little souls, they will have a hard time, I'm afraid,



<P>but they won't suffer, and it will do them good," she said,



<P>producing the more palatable viands with which she had provided



<P>herself, and disposing of the bad breakfast, so that their



<P>feelings might not be hurt, a motherly little deception for which



<P>they were grateful.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Many were the complaints below, and great the chagrin of



<P>the head cook at her failures.&nbsp; "Never mind, I'll get the dinner



<P>and be servant, you be mistress, keep your hands nice, see



<P>company, and give orders," said Jo, who knew still less than Meg,



<P>about culinary affairs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This obliging offer was gladly accepted, and Margaret retired



<P>to the parlor, which she hastily put in order by whisking the



<P>litter under the sofa and shutting the blinds to save the trouble



<P>of dusting.&nbsp; Jo, with perfect faith in her own powers and a



<P>friendly desire to make up the quarrel, immediately put a note in



<P>the office, inviting Laurie to dinner.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You'd better see what you have got before you think of having



<P>company," said Meg, when informed of the hospitable but rash act.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, there's corned beef and plenty of poatoes, and I shall



<P>get some asparagus and a lobster, `for a relish', as Hannah says.



<P>We'll have lettuce and make a salad.&nbsp; I don't know how, but the



<P>book tells.&nbsp; I'll have blancmange and strawberries for dessert,



<P>and coffee too, if you want to be elegant."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't try too many messes, Jo, for you can't make anything



<P>but gingerbread and molasses candy fit to eat.&nbsp; I wash my hands



<P>of the dinner party, and since you have asked Laurie on your own



<P>responsibility, you may just take care of him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't want you to do anything but be civil to him and help



<P>to the pudding.&nbsp; You'll give me your advice if I get in a muddle,



<P>won't you?" asked Jo, rather hurt.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, but I don't know much, except about bread and a few



<P>trifles.&nbsp; You had better ask Mother's leave before you order



<P>anything," returned Meg prudently.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Of course I shall.&nbsp; I'm not a fool."&nbsp; And Jo went off in

a



<P>huff at the doubts expressed of her powers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Get what you like, and don't disturb me.&nbsp; I'm going out to



<P>dinner and can't worry about things at home," said Mrs. March, when



<P>Jo spoke to her.&nbsp; "I never enjoyed housekeeping, and I'm going

to



<P>take a vacation today, and read, write, go visiting, and amuse myself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The unusual spectacle of her busy mother rocking comfortably



<P>and reading early in the morning made Jo feel as if some unnatural



<P>phenomenon had occurred, for an eclipse, an earthquake, or a



<P>volcanic eruption would hardly have seemed stranger.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Everything is out of sorts, somehow," she said to herself,



<P>going downstairs.&nbsp; "There's Beth crying, that's a sure sign that



<P>something is wrong in this family.&nbsp; If Amy is bothering, I'll



<P>shake her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Feeling very much out of sorts herself, Jo hurried into the



<P>parlor to find Beth sobbing over Pip, the canary, who lay dead in



<P>the cage with his little claws pathetically extended, as if



<P>imploring the food for want of which he had died.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's all my fault, I forgot him, there isn't a seed or a



<P>drop left.&nbsp; Oh, Pip!&nbsp; Oh, Pip!&nbsp; How could I be so cruel

to you?"



<P>cried Beth, taking the poor thing in her hands and trying to



<P>restore him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo peeped into his half-open eye, felt his little heart, and



<P>finding him stiff and cold, shook her head, and offered her domino



<P>box for a coffin.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Put him in the oven, and maybe his will get warm and revive,"



<P>said Amy hopefully.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He's been starved, and he shan't be baked now he's dead.&nbsp; I'll



<P>make him a shroud, and he shall be buried in the garden, and I'll



<P>never have another bird, never, my Pip!&nbsp; For I am too bad to own



<P>one," murmured Beth, sitting on the floor with her pet folded in



<P>her hands.



<P>"The funeral shall be this afternoon, and we will all go.&nbsp; Now,



<P>don't cry, Bethy.&nbsp; It's a pity, but nothing goes right this week,



<P>and Pip has had the worst of the experiment.&nbsp; Make the shroud,

and



<P>lay him in my box, and after the dinner party, we'll have a nice



<P>little funeral," said Jo, beginning to feel as if she had undertaken



<P>a good deal.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Leaving the others to console Beth, she departed to the kitchen,



<P>which was in a most discouraging state of confusion.&nbsp; Putting on

a



<P>big apron, she fell to work and got the dishes piled up ready for



<P>washing, when she discovered that the fire was out.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here's a sweet prospect!" muttered Jo, slamming the stove



<P>door open, and poking vigorously among the cinders.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Having rekindled the fire, she thought she would go to market



<P>while the water heated.&nbsp; The walk revived her spirits, and flattering



<P>herself that she had made good bargins, she trudged home again, after



<P>buying a very young lobster, some very old asparagus, and two boxes



<P>of acid strawberries.&nbsp; By the time she got cleared up, the dinner



<P>arrived and the stove was red-hot.&nbsp; Hannah had left a pan of bread



<P>to rise, Meg had worked it up early, set it on the hearth for a



<P>second rising, and forgotten it.&nbsp; Meg was entertaining Sallie



<P>Gardiner in the parlor, when the door flew open and a floury, crocky,



<P>flushed, and disheveled figure appeared, demanding tartly...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I say, isn't bread `riz' enough when it runs over the pans?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sallie began to laugh, but Meg nodded and lifted her eyebrows



<P>as high as they would go, which caused the apparition to vanish and



<P>put the sour bread into the oven without further delay.&nbsp; Mrs. March



<P>went out, after peeping here and there to see how matters went, also



<P>saying a word of comfort to Beth, who sat making a winding sheet,



<P>while the dear departed lay in state in the domino box.&nbsp; A strange



<P>sense of helplessness fell upon the girls as the gray bonnet



<P>vanished round the corner, and despair seized them when a few minutes



<P>later Miss Crocker appeared, and said she'd come to dinner.&nbsp; Now



<P>this lady was a thin, yellow spinster, with a sharp nose and



<P>inquisitive eyes, who saw everything and gossiped about all she saw.



<P>They disliked her, but had been taught to be kind to her, simply



<P>because she was old and poor and had few friends.&nbsp; So Meg gave

her



<P>the easy chair and tried to entertain her, while she asked questions,



<P>critsized everything, and told stories of the people whom she knew.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Language cannot describe the anxieties, experiences, and exertions



<P>which Jo underwent that morning, and the dinner she served up became

a



<P>standing joke.&nbsp; Fearing to ask any more advice, she did her best

alone,



<P>and discovered that something more than energy and good will is



<P>necessary to make a cook.&nbsp; She boiled the asparagus for an hour

and was



<P>grieved to find the heads cooked off and the stalks harder than ever.



<P>The bread burned black, for the salad dressing so aggravated her that



<P>she could not make it fit to ear.&nbsp; The lobster was a scarlet mystery

to



<P>her, but she hammered and poked till it was unshelled and its meager



<P>proportions concealed in a grove of lettuce leaves.&nbsp; The potatoes

had



<P>to be hurried, not to keep the asparagus waiting, and were not done



<P>at the last.&nbsp; The blancmange was lumpy, and the strawberries not

as



<P>ripe as they looked, having been skilfully `deaconed'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, they can eat beef and bread and butter, if they are



<P>hungry, only it's mortifying to have to spend your whole morning for



<P>nothing," thought Jo, as she rang the bell half an hour later than



<P>usual, and stood, hot, tired, and dispirited, surveying the feast



<P>spread before Laurie, accustomed to all sorts of elegance, and Miss



<P>Crocker, whose tattling tongue would report them far and wide.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Poor Jo would gladly have gone under the table, as one thing



<P>after another was tasted and left, while Amy giggled, Meg looked



<P>distressed, Miss Crocker pursed her lips, and Laurie talked and



<P>laughed with all his might to give a cheerful tone to the festive



<P>scene.&nbsp; Jo's one strong point was the fruit, for she had sugared

it



<P>well, and had a pitcher of rich cream to eat with it.&nbsp; Her hot

cheeks



<P>cooled a trifle, and she drew a long breath as the pretty glass



<P>plates went round, and everyone looked graciously at the little rosy



<P>islands floating in a sea of cream.&nbsp; Miss Crocker tasted first,

made



<P>a wry face, and drank some water hastily.&nbsp; Jo, who refused, thinking



<P>there might not be enough, for they dwindled sadly after the picking



<P>over, glanced at Laurie, but he was eating away manfully, though there



<P>was a slight pucker about his mouth and he kept his eye fixed on his



<P>plate.&nbsp; Amy, who was fond of delicate fare, took a heaping spoonful,



<P>choked, hid her face in her napkin, and left the table precipitately.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, what is it?" exclaimed Jo, trembling.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Salt instead of sugar, and the cream is sour," replied Meg



<P>with a tragic gesture.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo uttered a groan and fell back in her chair, remembering that



<P>she had given a last hasty powdering to the berries out of one of



<P>the two boxes on the kitchen table, and had neglected to put the



<P>milk in the refrigerator.&nbsp; She turned scarlet and was on the verge



<P>of crying, when she met Laurie's eyes, which would look merry in



<P>spite of his heroic efforts.&nbsp; The comical side of the affair suddenly



<P>struck her, and she laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks.&nbsp;

So



<P>did everyone else, even `Croaker' as the girls called the old lady,



<P>and the unfortunate dinner ended gaily, with bread and butter, olives



<P>and fun.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I haven't strength of mind enough to clear up now, so we will



<P>sober ourselves with a funeral," said Jo, as they rose, and Miss



<P>Crocker made ready to go, being eager to tell the new story at



<P>another friend's dinner table.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They did sober themselves for Beth's sake.&nbsp; Laurie dug a grave



<P>under the ferns in the grove, little Pip was laid in, with many tears



<P>by his tender-hearted mistress, and covered with moss, while a wreath



<P>of violets and chickweed was hung on the stone which bore his epitaph,



<P>composed by Jo while she struggled with the dinner.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here lies Pip March,



<P>Who died the 7th of June;



<P>Loved and lamented sore,



<P>And not forgotten soon.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At the conclusion of the ceremonies, Beth retired to her room,



<P>overcome with emotion and lobster, but there was no place of repose,



<P>for the beds were not made, and she found her grief much assuaged



<P>by beating up the pillows and putting things in order.&nbsp; Meg helped



<P>Jo clear away the remains of the feast, which took half the afternoon



<P>and left them so tired that they agreed to be contented with tea and



<P>toast for supper.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie took Amy to drive, which was a deed of charity, for the



<P>sour cream seemed to have had a bad effect upon her temper.&nbsp; Mrs.



<P>March came home to find the three older girls hard at work in the



<P>middle of the afternoon, and a glance at the closet gave her an idea



<P>of the success of one part of the experiment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Before the housewives could rest, several people called, and



<P>there was a scramble to get ready to see them.&nbsp; Then tea must be

got,



<P>errands done, and one or two necessary bits of sewing neglected until



<P>the last minute.&nbsp; As twilight fell, dewy and still, one by one

they



<P>gathered on the porch where the June roses were budding beautifully,



<P>and each groaned or sighed as she sat down, as if tired or troubled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What a dreadful day this has been!" began Jo, usually the first



<P>to speak.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It has seemed shorter than usual, but so uncomfortable," said Meg.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not a bit like home," added Amy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It can't seem so without Marmee and little Pip," sighed Beth,



<P>glancing with full eyes at the empty cage above her head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here's Mother, dear, and you shall have another bird tomorrow,



<P>if you want it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As she spoke, Mrs. March came and took her place among them,



<P>looking as if her holiday had not been much pleasanter than theirs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Are you satisfied with your experiment, girls, or do you want



<P>another week of it?" she asked, as Beth nestled up to her and the



<P>rest turned toward her with brightening faces, as flowers turn



<P>toward the sun.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't!" cried Jo decidedly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nor I," echoed the others.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You think then, that it is better to have a few duties and



<P>live a little for others, do you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Lounging and larking doesn't pay," observed Jo, shaking her head.



<P>"I'm tired of it and mean to go to work at something right off."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Suppose you learn plain cooking.&nbsp; That's a useful accomplishment,



<P>which no woman should be without," said Mrs. March, laughing



<P>inaudibly at the recollection of Jo's dinner party, for she had



<P>met Miss Crocker and heard her account of it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mother, did you go away and let everything be, just to see how



<P>we'd get on?" cried Meg, who had had suspicions all day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, I wanted you to see how the comfort of all depends on



<P>each doing her share faithfully.&nbsp; While Hannah and I did your work,



<P>you got on pretty well, though I don't think you were very happy



<P>or amiable.&nbsp; So I thought, as a little lesson, I would show you



<P>what happens when everyone thinks only of herself.&nbsp; Don't you feel



<P>that it is pleasanter to help one another, to have daily duties



<P>which make leisure sweet when it comes, and to bear and forbear,



<P>that home may be comfortable and lovely to us all?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We do, Mother we do!" cried the girls.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again,



<P>for though they seem heavy sometimes, they are good for us, and



<P>lighten as we learn to carry them.&nbsp; Work is wholesome, and there



<P>is plenty for everyone.&nbsp; It keeps us from ennui and mischief, is



<P>good for health and spirits, and gives us a sense of power and



<P>independence better than money or fashion."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We'll work like bees, and love it too, see if we don't,"



<P>said Jo.&nbsp; "I'll learn plain cooking for my holiday task, and the



<P>dinner party I have shall be a success."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll make the set of shirts for father, instead of letting



<P>you do it, Marmee.&nbsp; I can and I will, though I'm not fond of sewing.



<P>That will be better than fussing over my own things, which are plenty



<P>nice enough as they are." said Meg.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll do my lessons every day, and not spend so much time with



<P>my music and dolls.&nbsp; I am a stupid thing, and ought to be studying,



<P>not playing," was Beth's resolution, while Amy followed their example



<P>by heroically declaring, "I shall learn to make buttonholes, and



<P>attend to my parts of speech."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very good!&nbsp; Then I am quite satisfied with the experiment, and



<P>fancy that we shall not have to repeat it, only don't go to the other



<P>extreme and delve like slaves.&nbsp; Have regular hours for work and

play,



<P>make each day both useful and pleasant, and prove that you understand



<P>the worth of time by employing it well.&nbsp; Then youth will be delightful,



<P>old age will bring few regrets, and life become a beautiful success,

in



<P>spite of poverty."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We'll remember, Mother!"&nbsp; And they did.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What in the world are you going to do now, Jo." asked



<P>Meg one snowy afternoon, as her sister came tramping through



<P>the hall, in rubber boots, old sack, and hood, with a broom



<P>in one hand and a shovel in the other.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Going out for exercise," answered Jo with a mischievous



<P>twinkle in her eyes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I should think two long walks this morning would have



<P>been enough!&nbsp; It's cold and dull out, and I advise you to



<P>stay warm and dry by the fire, as I do," said Meg with a



<P>shiver.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Never take advice!&nbsp; Can't keep still all day, and not



<P>being a pussycat, I don't like to doze by the fire.&nbsp; I like



<P>adventures, and I'm going to find some."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg went back to toast her feet and read IVANHOE, and Jo



<P>began to dig paths with great energy.&nbsp; The snow was light, and



<P>with her broom she soon swept a path all round the garden, for



<P>Beth to walk in when the sun came out and the invalid dolls



<P>needed air.&nbsp; Now, the garden separated the Marches' house from



<P>that of Mr. Laurence.&nbsp; Both stood in a suburb of the city, which



<P>was still countrylike, with groves and lawns, large gardens, and



<P>quiet streets.&nbsp; A low hedge parted the two estates.&nbsp; On one

side



<P>was an old, brown house, looking rather bare and shabby, robbed



<P>of the vines that in summer covered its walls and the flowers,



<P>which then surrounded it.&nbsp; On the other side was a stately stone



<P>mansion, plainly betokening every sort of comfort and luxury, from



<P>the big coach house and well-kept grounds to the conservatory and



<P>the glimpses of lovely things one caught between the rich curtains.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Yet it seemed a lonely, lifeless sort of house, for no children



<P>frolicked on the lawn, no motherly face ever smiled at the windows,



<P>and few people went in and out, except the old gentleman and his



<P>grandson.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To Jo's lively fancy, this fine house seemed a kind of enchanted



<P>palace, full of splendors and delights which no one enjoyed.&nbsp; She



<P>had long wanted to behold these hidden glories, and to know the



<P>Laurence boy, who looked as if he would like to be known, if he only



<P>knew how to begin.&nbsp; Since the party, she had been more eager than

ever,



<P>and had planned many ways of making friends with him, but he had not



<P>been seen lately, and Jo began to think he had gone away, when she



<P>one day spied a brown face at an upper window, looking wistfully down



<P>into their garden, where Beth and Amy were snow-balling one another.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That boy is suffering for society and fun," she said to herself.



<P>"His grandpa does not know what's good for him, and keeps him shut up



<P>all alone.&nbsp; He needs a party of jolly boys to play with, or somebody



<P>young and lively.&nbsp; I've a great mind to go over and tell the old



<P>gentleman so!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The idea amused Jo.&nbsp; who liked to do daring things and was



<P>always scandalizing Meg by her queer performances.&nbsp; The plan of



<P>`going over' was not forgotten.&nbsp; And when the snowy afternoon came,



<P>Jo resolved to try what could be done.&nbsp; She saw Mr. Lawrence drive

off,



<P>and then sallied out to dig her way down to the hedge, where she



<P>paused and took a survey.&nbsp; All quiet, curtains down at the lower

windows,



<P>servants out of sight, and nothing human visible but a curly



<P>black head leaning on a thin hand at the upper window.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There he is," thought Jo, "Poor boy!&nbsp; All alone and sick this



<P>dismal day.&nbsp; It's a shame!&nbsp; I'll toss up a snowball and make

him look



<P>out, and then say a kind word to him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Up went a handful of soft snow, and the head turned at once,



<P>showing a face which lost its listless look in a minute, as the big



<P>eyes brightened and the mouth began to smile.&nbsp; Jo nodded and laughed,



<P>and flourished her broom as she called out...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How do you do?&nbsp; Are you sick?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie opened the window, and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Better, thank you.&nbsp; I've had a bad cold, and been shut up a



<P>week."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm sorry.&nbsp; What do you amuse yourself with?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nothing.&nbsp; It's dull as tombs up here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't you read?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not much.&nbsp; They won't let me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Can't somebody read to you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Grandpa does sometimes, but my books don't interest him, and



<P>I hate to ask Brooke all the time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Have someone come and see you then."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There isn't anyone I'd like to see.&nbsp; Boys make such a row, and



<P>my head is weak."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Isn't there some nice girl who'd read and amuse you?&nbsp; Girls



<P>are quiet and like to play nurse."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't know any."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You know us," began Jo, then laughed and stopped.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So I do!&nbsp; Will you come, please?" cried Laurie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm not quiet and nice, but I'll come, if Mother will let me.



<P>I'll go ask her.&nbsp; Shut the window, like a good boy, and wait till

I



<P>come."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With that, Jo shouldered her broom and marched into the house,



<P>wondering what they would all say to her.&nbsp; Laurie was in a flutter



<P>of excitement at the idea of having company, and flew about to get



<P>ready, for as Mrs. March said, he was `a little gentleman'.&nbsp; and

did



<P>honor to the coming guest by brushing his curly pate, putting on a



<P>fresh color, and trying tidy up the room, which in spite of half a



<P>dozen servants, was anything but neat.&nbsp; Presently there came a

loud



<P>ring, than a decided voice, asking for `Mr. laurie', and a surprised-



<P>looking servant came running up to announce a young lady.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"All right, show her up, it's Miss Jo, "said Laurie, going to the



<P>door of his little parlor to meet Jo, who appeared, looking rosy and



<P>quite at her ease, with a covered dish in one hand and Beth's three



<P>kittens in the other.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here I am, bag and baggage," she said briskly.&nbsp; "Mother sent her



<P>love, and was glad if I could do anything for you.&nbsp; Meg wanted

me to



<P>bring some of her blancmange, she makes it very nicely, and Beth thought



<P>her cats would be comforting.&nbsp; I knew you'd laugh at them, but

I couldn't



<P>refuse, she was so anxious to do something."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It so happened that Beth's funny loan was just the thing, for



<P>in laughing over the kits, Laurie forgot his bashfulness, and grew



<P>sociable at once.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That looks too pretty to eat," he said, smiling with pleasure,



<P>as Jo uncovered the dish, and showed the blancmange, surrounded by a



<P>garland of green leaves, and the scarlet flowers of Amy's pet geranium.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It isn't anything, only they all felt kindly and wanted to show



<P>it.&nbsp; Tell the girl to put it away for your tea.&nbsp; It's so simple

you can



<P>eat it, and being soft, it will slip down without hurting your sore



<P>throat.&nbsp; What a cozy room this is!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It might be it it was kept nice, but the maids are lazy, and



<P>I don't know how to make them mind.&nbsp; It worries me though."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll right it up in two minutes, for it only needs to have the



<P>hearth brushed, so--and the things made straight on the mantelpiece,



<P>so--and the books put here, and the bottles there, and your sofa



<P>turned from the light, and the pillows plumped up a bit.&nbsp; Now then,



<P>you're fixed."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And so he was, for, as she laughed and talked, Jo had whisked



<P>things into place and given quite a different air to the room.&nbsp;

Laurie



<P>watched her in respectful silence, and when she beckoned him to his



<P>sofa, he sat down with a sigh of satisfaction, saying gratefully...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How kind you are!&nbsp; Yes, that's what it wanted.&nbsp; Now please

take



<P>the big chair and let me do something to amuse my company."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I came to amuse you.&nbsp; Shall I read aloud?" and Jo looked



<P>affectionately toward some inviting books near by.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you!&nbsp; I've read all those, and if you don't mind, I'd



<P>rather talk," answered Laurie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not a bit.&nbsp; I'll talk all day if you'll only set me going.



<P>Beth says I never know when to stop."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Is Beth the rosy one, who stays at home good deal and sometimes



<P>goes out with a little basket?" asked Laurie with interest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, that's Beth.&nbsp; She's my girl, and a regular good one she is,

too."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The pretty one is Meg, and the curly-haired one is Amy, I believe?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie colored up, but answered frankly, "Why, you see I often



<P>hear you calling to one another, and when I'm alone up here, I can't



<P>help looking over at your house, you always seem to be having such



<P>good times.&nbsp; I beg your pardon for being so rude, but sometimes

you



<P>forget to put down the curtain at the window where the flowers are.



<P>And when the lamps are lighted, it's like looking at a picture to



<P>see the fire, and you all around the table with your mother.&nbsp; Her



<P>face is right opposite, and it looks so sweet behind the flowers,



<P>I can't help watching it.&nbsp; I haven't got any mother, you know."



<P>And Laurie poked the fire to hide a little twitching of the lips



<P>that he could not control.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The solitary, hungry look in his eyes went straight to Jo's



<P>warm heart.&nbsp; she had been so simply taught that there was no



<P>nonsense in her head, and at fifteen she was as innocent and frank



<P>as any child.&nbsp; Laurie was sick and lonely, and feeling how rich

she



<P>was in home and happiness, she gladly tried to share it with him.



<P>Her face was very friendly and her sharp voice unusually gentle as



<P>she said...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We'll never draw that curtain any more, and I give you leave



<P>to look as much as you like.&nbsp; I just wish, though, instead of peeping,



<P>you'd come over and see us.&nbsp; Mother is so splendid, she'd do you

heaps



<P>of good, and Beth would sing to you if I begged her to, and Amy would



<P>dance.&nbsp; Meg and I would make you laugh over our funny stage



<P>properties, and we'd have jolly times.&nbsp; Wouldn't your grandpa let

you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think he would, if your mother asked him.&nbsp; He's very kind,



<P>though he does not look so, and he lets me do what I like, pretty much,



<P>only he's afraid I might be a bother to strangers," began Laurie,



<P>brightening more and more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We are not strangers, we are neighbors, and you needn't think



<P>you'd be a bother.&nbsp; We want to know you, and I've been trying to

do



<P>it this ever so long.&nbsp; We haven't been here a great while, you

know,



<P>but we have got acquainted with all our neighbors but you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You see, Grandpa lives among his books, and doesn't mind much



<P>what happens outside.&nbsp; Mr. Brooke, my tutor, doesn't stay here,

you



<P>know, and I have no one to go about with me, so I just stop at home



<P>and get on as I can."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's bad.&nbsp; You ought to make an effort and go visiting



<P>everywhere you are asked, then you'll have plenty of friends, and



<P>pleasant places to go to.&nbsp; Never mind being bashful.&nbsp; It won't

last



<P>long if you keep going."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie turned red again, but wasn't offended at being accused



<P>of bashfulness, for there was so much good will in Jo it was



<P>impossible not to take her blunt speeches as kindly as they were



<P>meant.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you like your school?" asked the boy, changing the subject,



<P>after a little pause, during which he stared at the fire and Jo



<P>looked about her, well pleased.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't go to school, I'm a businessman--girl, I mean.&nbsp; I go to



<P>wait on my great-aunt, and a dear, cross old soul she is, too,"



<P>answered Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie opened his mouth to ask another question, but remembering



<P>just in time that it wasn't manners to make too many inquiries into



<P>people's affairs, he shut it again, and looked uncomfortable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo liked his good breeding, and didn't mind having a laugh at



<P>Aunt March, so she gave him a lively description of the fidgety



<P>old lady, her fat poodle, the parrot that talked Spanish, and the



<P>library where she reveled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie enjoyed that immensely, and when she told about the



<P>prim old gentleman who came once to woo Aunt March, and in the



<P>middle of a fine speech, how Poll had tweaked his wig off to his



<P>great dismay, the boy lay back and laughed till the tears ran



<P>down his cheeks, and a maid popped her head in to see what was



<P>the matter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh!&nbsp; That does me no end of good.&nbsp; Tell on, please," he



<P>said, taking his face out of the sofa cushion, red and shining



<P>with merriment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Much elated with her success, Jo did `tell on', all about



<P>their plays and plans, their hopes and fears for Father, and



<P>the most interesting events of the little world in which the



<P>sisters lived.&nbsp; Then they got to talking about books, and to



<P>Jo's delight, she found that Laurie loved them as well as she



<P>did, and had read even more than herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If you like them so much, come down and see ours.&nbsp; Grandfather



<P>is out, so you needn't be afraid," said Laurie, getting up.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm not afraid of anything," returned Jo, with a toss of



<P>the head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't believe you are!" exclaimed the boy, looking at her



<P>with much admiration, though he privately thought she would have



<P>good reason to be a trifle afraid of the old gentleman, if she



<P>met hem in some of his moods.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The atmosphere of the whole house being summerlike, Laurie



<P>led the way from room to room, letting Jo stop to examine whatever



<P>struck her fancy.&nbsp; And so, at last they came to the library,



<P>where she clapped her hands and pranced, as she always did when



<P>especially delighted.&nbsp; It was lined with books, and there were



<P>pictures and statues, and distracting little cabinets full of



<P>coins and curiosities, and Sleepy Hollow chairs, and queer tables,



<P>and bronzes, and best of all, a great open fireplace with quaint



<P>tiles all round it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What richness!" sighed Jo, sinking into the depth of a velour



<P>chair and gazing about her with an air of intense satisfaction.



<P>"Theodore Laurence, you ought to be the happiest boy in the world,"



<P>she added impressively.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A fellow can't live on books," said Laurie, shaking his head



<P>as he perched on a table opposite.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Before he could more, a bell rang, and Jo flew up, exclaiming



<P>with alarm, "Mercy me!&nbsp; It's your grandpa!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, what if it is?&nbsp; You are not afraid of anything, you



<P>know," returned the boy, looking wicked.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think I am a little bit afraid of him, but I don't know



<P>why I should be.&nbsp; Marmee said I might come, and I don't think



<P>you're any the worse for it," said Jo, composing herself, though



<P>she kept her eyes on the door.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm a great deal better for it, and ever so much obliged.



<P>I'm only afraid you are very tired of talking to me.&nbsp; It was so



<P>pleasant, I couldn't bear to stop," said Laurie gratefully.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The doctor to see you, sir," and the maid beckoned as she



<P>spoke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Would you mind if I left you for a minute?&nbsp; I suppose I



<P>must see him," said Laurie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't mind me.&nbsp; I'm happy as a cricket here," answered Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie went away, and his guest amused herself in her own way.



<P>She was standing before a fine portrait of the old gentleman when



<P>the door opened again, and without turning, she said decidedly, "I'm



<P>sure now that I shouldn't be afraid of him, for he's got kind eyes,



<P>though his mouth is grim, and he looks as if he had a tremendous will



<P>of his own.&nbsp; He isn't as handsome as my grandfather, but I like

him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you, ma'am," said a gruff voice behind her, and there,



<P>to her great dismay, stood old Mr. Laurence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Poor Jo blushed till she couldn't blush any redder, and her



<P>heart began to beat uncomfortably fast as she thought what she had



<P>said.&nbsp; For a minute a wild desire to run away possessed her, but



<P>that was cowardly, and the girls would laugh at her, so she resolved



<P>to stay and get out of the scrape as she could.&nbsp; A second look

showed



<P>her that the living eyes, under the bushy eyebrows, were kinder even



<P>than the painted ones, and there was a sly twinkle in them, which



<P>lessened her fear a good deal.&nbsp; The gruff voice was gruffer than

ever,



<P>as the old gentleman said abruptly, after the dreadful pause, "So



<P>you're not afraid of me, hey?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not much, sir."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And you don't think me as handsome as your grandfather?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not quite, sir."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And I've got a tremendous will, have I?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I only said I thought so."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But you like me in spite of it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, I do, sir."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That answer pleased the old gentleman.&nbsp; He gave a short laugh,



<P>shook hands with her, and, putting his finger under her chin, turned



<P>up her face, examined it gravely, and let it go, saying with a nod,



<P>"You've got your grandfather's spirit, if you haven't his face.&nbsp;

He



<P>was a fine man, my dear, but what is better, he was a brave and an



<P>honest one, and I was proud to be his friend."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you, sir," And Jo was quite comfortable after that, for



<P>it suited her exactly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What have you been doing to this boy of mine, hey?" was the



<P>next question, sharply put.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Only trying to be neighborly, sir."&nbsp; And Jo to how her visit



<P>came about.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You think he needs cheering up a bit, do you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, sir, he seems a little lonely, and young folks would do



<P>him good perhaps.&nbsp; We are only girls, but we should be glad to



<P>help if we could, for we don't forget the splendid Christmas present



<P>you sent us," said Jo eagerly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Tut, tut, tut!&nbsp; That was the boy's affair.&nbsp; How is the poor



<P>woman?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Doing nicely, sir."&nbsp; And off went Jo, talking very fast, as



<P>she told all about the Hummels, in whom her mother had interested



<P>richer friends than they were.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Just her father's way of doing good.&nbsp; I shall come and see



<P>your mother some fine day.&nbsp; Tell her so.&nbsp; There's the tea

bell,



<P>we have it early on the boy's account.&nbsp; Come down and go on being



<P>neighborly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If you'd like to have me, sir."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Shouldn't ask you, if I didn't."&nbsp; And Mr. Laurence offered



<P>her his arm with old-fashioned courtesy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What would Meg say to this?" thought Jo, as she was marched



<P>away, while her eyes danced with fun as she imagined herself telling



<P>the story at home.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hey!&nbsp; Why, what the dickens has come to the fellow?" said the



<P>old gentleman, as Laurie came running downstairs and brought up with



<P>a start of surprise at the astounding sight of Jo arm in arm with



<P>his redoubtable grandfather.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I didn't know you'd come, sir," he began, as Jo gave him a



<P>triumphant little glance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's evident, by the way you racket downstairs.&nbsp; Come to



<P>your tea, sir, and behave like a gentleman."&nbsp; And having pulled



<P>the boy's hair by way of a caress, Mr. Laurence walked on, while



<P>Laurie went through a series of comic evolutions behind their



<P>backs, which nearly produced an explosion of laughter from Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The old gentleman did not say much as he drank his four



<P>cups of tea, but he watched the young people, who soon chatted



<P>away like old friends, and the change in his grandson did not



<P>escape him.&nbsp; There was color, light, and life in the boy's face



<P>now, vivacity in his manner, and genuine merriment in his laugh.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She's right, the lad is lonely.&nbsp; I'll see what these little



<P>girls can do for him," thought Mr. Laurence, as he looked and



<P>listened.&nbsp; He liked Jo, for her odd, blunt ways suited him, and



<P>she seemed to understand the boy almost as well as if she had



<P>been one herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If the Laurences had been what Jo called `prim and poky',



<P>she would not have got on at all, for such people always made



<P>her shy and awkward.&nbsp; But finding them free and easy, she was



<P>so herself, and made a good impression.&nbsp; When they rose she



<P>proposed to go, but Laurie said he had something more to show



<P>her, and took her away to the conservatory, which had been



<P>lighted for her benefit.&nbsp; It seemed quite fairylike to Jo, as



<P>she went up and down the walks, enjoying the blooming walls on



<P>either side, the soft light, the damp sweet air, and the wonderful



<P>vines and trees that hung about her, while her new friend cut the



<P>finest flowers till his hands were full.&nbsp; Then he tied them up,



<P>saying, with the happy look Jo liked to see, "Please give these



<P>to your mother, and tell her I like the medicine she sent me very



<P>much."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They found Mr. Laurence standing before the fire in the great



<P>drawing room, by Jo's attention was entirely absorbed by a grand



<P>piano, which stood open.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you play?" she asked, turning to Laurie with a respectful



<P>expression.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sometimes," he answered modestly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Please do now.&nbsp; I want to hear it, so I can tell Beth."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Won't you first?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't know how.&nbsp; Too stupid to learn, but I love music dearly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So Laurie played and Jo listened, with her nose luxuriously



<P>buried in heliotrope and tea roses.&nbsp; Her respect and regard for



<P>the `Laurence' boy increased very much, for he played remarkably well



<P>and didn't put on any airs.&nbsp; She wished Beth could hear him, but



<P>she did not say so, only praised him till he was quite abashed, and



<P>his grandfather came to his rescue.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That will do, that will do, young lady.&nbsp; too many sugarplums



<P>are not good for him.&nbsp; His music isn't bad, but I hope he will

do



<P>as well in more important things.&nbsp; Going?&nbsp; well, I'm much

obliged



<P>to you, and I hope you'll come again.&nbsp; My respects to your mother.



<P>Good night, Doctor Jo."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He shook hands kindly, but looked as if something did not



<P>please him.&nbsp; When they got into the hall, Jo asked Laurie if she



<P>had said something amiss.&nbsp; He shook his head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, it was me.&nbsp; He doesn't like to hear me play."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why not?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll tell you some day.&nbsp; John is going home with you, as I



<P>can't."



<P>"No need of that.&nbsp; I am not a young lady, and it's only a



<P>step.&nbsp; Take care of yourself, won't you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, but you will come again, I hope?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If you promise to come and see us after you are well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I will."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Good night, Laurie!"



<P>"Good night, Jo, good night!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When all the afternoon's adventures had been told, the family



<P>felt inclined to go visiting in a body, for each found something



<P>very attractive in the big house on the other side of the hedge.



<P>Mrs. March wanted to talk of her father with the old man who had



<P>not forgotten him, Meg longed to walk in the conservatory, Beth



<P>sighed for the grand piano.&nbsp; and Amy was eager to see the fine



<P>pictures and statues.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mother, why didn't Mr. Laurence like to have Laurie play?"



<P>asked Jo, who was of an inquiring disposition.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am not sure, but I think it was because his son, Laurie's



<P>father, married an Italian lady, a musician, which displeased the



<P>old man, who is very proud.&nbsp; The lady was good and lovely and



<P>accomplished, but he did not like her, and never saw his son after



<P>he married.&nbsp; They both died when Laurie was a little child, and



<P>then his grandfather took him home.&nbsp; I fancy the boy, who was born



<P>in Italy, is not very strong, and the old man is afraid of losing



<P>him, which makes him so careful.&nbsp; Laurie comes naturally by his



<P>love of music, for he is like his mother, and I dare say his



<P>grandfather fears that he may want to be a musician.&nbsp; At any rate,



<P>his skill reminds him of the woman he did not like, and so he



<P>`glowered' as Jo said."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dear me, how romantic!" exclaimed Meg.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How silly!" said Jo.&nbsp; "Let him be a musician if he wants to,



<P>and not plague his life out sending him to college, when he hates



<P>to go."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's why he has such handsome black eyes and pretty manners,



<P>I suppose.&nbsp; Italians are always nice," said Meg, who was a little



<P>sentimental.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What do you know about his eyes and his manners?&nbsp; You never



<P>spoke to him, hardly," cried Jo, who was not sentimental.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I saw him at the party, and what you tell shows that he knows



<P>how to behave.&nbsp; That was a nice little speech about the medicine



<P>Mother sent him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He meant the blanc mange, I suppose."



<P>"How stupid you are, child!&nbsp; He meant you, of course."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Did he?" And Jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred



<P>to her before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I never saw such a girl!&nbsp; You don't know a compliment when



<P>you get it," said Meg, with the air of a young lady who knew all



<P>about the matter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think they are great nonsense, and I'll thank you not to



<P>be silly and spoil my fun.&nbsp; Laurie's a nice boy and I like him,



<P>and I won't have any sentimental stuff about compliments and such



<P>rubbish.&nbsp; We'll all be good to him because he hasn't got any mother,



<P>and he may come over and see us, mayn't he, Marmee?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, Jo, your little friend is very welcome, and I hope Meg



<P>will remember that children should be children as long as they can."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't call myself a child, and I'm not in my teens yet,"



<P>observed Amy.&nbsp; "What do you say, Beth?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was thinking about our `PILGRIM'S PROGRESS'," answered Beth,



<P>who had not heard a word.&nbsp; "How we got out of the Slough and through



<P>the Wicket Gate by resolving to be good, and up the steep hill by



<P>trying, and that maybe the house over there, full of splendid things,



<P>is going to be our Palace Beautiful."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We have got to get by the lions first," said Jo, as if she



<P>rather liked the prospect.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie went to Nice intending to stay a week, and remained



<P>a month.&nbsp; He was tired of wandering about alone, and Amy's



<P>familiar presence seemed to give a homelike charm to the



<P>foreign scenes in which she bore a part.&nbsp; He rather missed the



<P>`petting' he used to receive, and enjoyed a taste of it again,



<P>for no attentions, however flattering, from strangers, were half



<P>so pleasant as the sisterly adoration of the girls at home.&nbsp; Amy



<P>never would pet him like the others, but she was very glad to



<P>see him now, and quite clung to him, feeling that he was the



<P>representative of the dear family for whom she longed more



<P>than she would confess.&nbsp; They naturally took comfort in each



<P>other's society and were much together, riding, walking, dancing,



<P>or dawdling, for at Nice no one can be very industrious during



<P>the gay season.&nbsp; But, while apparently amusing themselves in



<P>the most careless fashion, they were half-consciously making



<P>discoveries and forming opinions about each other.&nbsp; Amy rose



<P>daily in the estimation of her friend, but he sank in hers,



<P>and each felt the truth before a word was spoken.&nbsp; Amy tried



<P>to please, and succeeded, for she was grateful for the many



<P>pleasures he gave her, and repaid him with the little services



<P>to which womanly women know how to lend an indescribable



<P>charm.&nbsp; Laurie made no effort of any kind, but just let



<P>himself drift along as comfortably as possible, trying to



<P>forget, and feeling that all women owed him a kind word because



<P>one had been cold to him.&nbsp; It cost him no effort to be



<P>generous, and he would have given Amy all the trinkets in



<P>Nice if she would have taken them, but at the same time he



<P>felt that he could not change the opinion she was forming of



<P>him, and he rather dreaded the keen blue eyes that seemed to



<P>watch him with such half-sorrowful, half-scornful surprise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"All the rest have gone to Monaco for the day.&nbsp; I preferred



<P>to stay at home and write letters.&nbsp; They are done now,



<P>and I am going to Valrosa to sketch, will you come?' said Amy,



<P>as she joined Laurie one lovely day when he lounged in as usual



<P>about noon.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, yes, but isn't it rather warm for such a long walk?"



<P>he answered slowly, for the shaded salon looked inviting after



<P>the glare without.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm going to have the little carriage, and Baptiste can



<P>drive, so you'll have nothing to do but hold your umbrella,



<P>and keep your gloves nice," returned Amy, with a sarcastic



<P>glance at the immaculate kids, which were a weak point with



<P>Laurie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then I'll go with pleasure."&nbsp; And he put out his hand for



<P>her sketchbook.&nbsp; But she tucked it under her arm with a sharp...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't trouble yourself.&nbsp; It's no exertion to me, but you



<P>don't look equal to it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie lifted his eyebrows and followed at a leisurely pace



<P>as she ran downstairs, but when they got into the carriage he took



<P>the reins himself, and left little Baptiste nothing to do but fold



<P>his arms and fall asleep on his perch.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The two never quarreled.&nbsp; Amy was too well-bred, and just now



<P>Laurie was too lazy, so in a minute he peeped under her hatbrim



<P>with an inquiring air.&nbsp; She answered him with a smile, and they



<P>went on together in the most amicable manner.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was a lovely drive, along winding roads rich in the picturesque



<P>scenes that delight beauty-loving eyes.&nbsp; Here an ancient



<P>monastery, whence the solemn chanting of the monks came down to



<P>them.&nbsp; There a bare-legged shepherd, in wooden shoes, pointed hat,



<P>and rough jacket over one shoulder, sat piping on a stone while



<P>his goats skipped among the rocks or lay at his feet.&nbsp; Meek,



<P>mouse-colored donkeys, laden with panniers of freshly cut grass



<P>passed by, with a pretty girl in a capaline sitting between the



<P>green piles, or an old woman spinning with a distaff as she went.



<P>Brown, soft-eyed children ran out from the quaint stone hovels



<P>to offer nosegays, or bunches of oranges still on the bough.



<P>Gnarled olive trees covered the hills with their dusky foliage,



<P>fruit hung golden in the orchard, and great scarlet anemones



<P>fringed the roadside, while beyond green slopes and craggy heights,



<P>the Maritime Alps rose sharp and white against the blue Italian sky.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Valrosa well deserved its name, for in that climate of perpetual



<P>summer roses blossomed everywhere.&nbsp; They overhung the



<P>archway, thrust themselves between the bars of the great gate



<P>with a sweet welcome to passers-by, and lined the avenue, winding



<P>through lemon trees and feathery palms up to the villa on the hill.



<P>Every shadowy nook, where seats invited one to stop and rest, was



<P>a mass of bloom, every cool grotto had its marble nymph smiling



<P>from a veil of flowers and every fountain reflected crimson, white,



<P>or pale pink roses, leaning down to smile at their own beauty.



<P>Roses covered the walls of the house, draped the cornices, climbed



<P>the pillars, and ran riot over the balustrade of the wide terrace,



<P>whence one looked down on the sunny Mediterranean, and the white-walled



<P>city on its shore.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This is a regular honeymoon paradise, isn't it?&nbsp; Did you



<P>ever see such roses?" asked Amy, pausing on the terrace to enjoy



<P>the view, and a luxurious whiff of perfume that came wandering by.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, nor felt such thorns," returned Laurie, with his thumb



<P>in his mouth, after a vain attempt to capture a solitary scarlet



<P>flower that grew just beyond his reach.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Try lower down, and pick those that have no thorns," said



<P>Amy, gathering three of the tiny cream-colored ones that starred



<P>the wall behind her.&nbsp; She put them in his buttonhole as a peace



<P>offering, and he stood a minute looking down at them with a



<P>curious expression, for in the Italian part of his nature there



<P>was a touch of superstition, and he was just then in that state



<P>of half-sweet, half-bitter melancholy, when imaginative young



<P>men find significance in trifles and food for romance everywhere.



<P>He had thought of Jo in reaching after the thorny red rose, for



<P>vivid flowers became her, and she had often worn ones like that



<P>from the greenhouse at home.&nbsp; The pale roses Amy gave him were



<P>the sort that the Italians lay in dead hands, never in bridal



<P>wreaths, and for a moment he wondered if the omen was for Jo or



<P>for himself, but the next instant his American common sense got



<P>the better of sentimentality, and he laughed a heartier laugh



<P>than Amy had heard since he came.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's good advice, you'd better take it and save your fingers,"



<P>she said, thinking her speech amused him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you, I will," he answered in jest, and a few months



<P>later he did it in earnest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Laurie, when are you going to your grandfather?" she asked



<P>presently, as she settled herself on a rustic seat.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very soon."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You have said that a dozen times within the last three



<P>weeks."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I dare say, short answers save trouble."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He expects you, and you really ought to go."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hospitable creature!&nbsp; I know it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then why don't you do it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Natural depravity, I suppose."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Natural indolence, you mean.&nbsp; It's really dreadful!"



<P>And Amy looked severe.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not so bad as it seems, for I should only plague him if I



<P>went, so I might as well stay and plague you a little longer,



<P>you can bear it better, in fact I think it agrees with you excellently."



<P>And Laurie composed himself for a lounge on the broad ledge of the balustrade.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy shook her head and opened her sketchbook with an



<P>air of resignation, but she had made up her mind to lecture



<P>`that boy' and in a minute she began again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What are you doing just now?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Watching lizards."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, no.&nbsp; I mean what do you intend and wish to do?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Smoke a cigarette, if you'll allow me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How provoking you are!&nbsp; I don't approve of cigars and I will only

allow



<P>it on condition that you let me put you into my sketch.&nbsp; I need

a figure."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"With all the pleasure in life.&nbsp; How will you have me, full



<P>length or three-quarters, on my head or my heels?&nbsp; I should



<P>respectfully suggest a recumbent posture, then put yourself



<P>in also and call it `Dolce far niente'."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Stay as you are, and go to sleep if you like.&nbsp; I intend to



<P>work hard," said Amy in her most energetic tone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What delightful enthusiasm!"&nbsp; And he leaned against a tall



<P>urn with an ir of entire satisfaction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What would Jo say if she saw you now?" asked Amy impatiently,



<P>hoping to stir him up by the mention of her still more



<P>energetic sister's name.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"As usual, `Go away, Teddy.&nbsp; I'm busy!'" He laughed as he



<P>spoke, but the laugh was not natural, and a shade passed over



<P>his face, for the utterance of the familiar name touched the



<P>wound that was not healed yet.&nbsp; Both tone and shadow struck Amy,



<P>for she had seen and heard them before, and now she looked up



<P>in time to catch a new expression on Laurie's face--a hard bitter



<P>look, full of pain, dissatisfaction, and regret.&nbsp; It was gone before



<P>she could study it and the listless expression back again.



<P>She watched him for a moment with artistic pleasure, thinking



<P>how like an Italian he looked, as he lay basking in the sun



<P>with uncovered head and eyes full of southern dreaminess, for



<P>he seemed to have forgotten her and fallen into a reverie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You look like the effigy of a young knight asleep on his



<P>tomb," she said, carefully tracing the well-cut profile defined



<P>against the dark stone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Wish I was!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's a foolish wish, unless you have spoiled your life.



<P>You are so changed, I sometimes think--" There Amy stopped,



<P>with a half-timid, half-wistful look, more significant than her



<P>unfinished speech.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie saw and understood the affectionate anxiety which



<P>she hesitated to express, and looking straight into her eyes,



<P>said, just as he used to say it to her mother, "It's all right, ma'am."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That satisfied her and set at rest the doubts that had begun



<P>to worry her lately.&nbsp; It also touched her, and she showed



<P>that it did, by the cordial tone in which she said...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm glad of that!&nbsp; I didn't think you'd been a very bad



<P>boy, but I fancied you might have wasted money at that wicked



<P>Baden-Baden, lost your heart to some charming Frenchwoman



<P>with a husband, or got into some of the scrapes that young men



<P>seem to consider a necessary part of a foreign tour.&nbsp; Don't



<P>stay out there in the sun, come and lie on the grass here and



<P>`let us be friendly', as Jo used to say when we got in the sofa



<P>corner and told secrets."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie obediently threw himself down on the turf, and



<P>began to amuse himself by sticking daisies into the ribbons of



<P>Amy's hat, that lay there.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm all ready for the secrets."&nbsp; And he glanced up with



<P>a decided expression of interest in his eyes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I've none to tell.&nbsp; You may begin."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Haven't one to bless myself with.&nbsp; I thought perhaps you'd



<P>had some news from home.."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You have heard all that has come lately.&nbsp; Don't you hear



<P>often?&nbsp; I fancied Jo would send you volumes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She's very busy.&nbsp; I'm roving about so, it's impossible to



<P>be regular, you know.&nbsp; When do you begin your great work of art,



<P>Raphaella?' he asked.&nbsp; changing the subject abruptly after



<P>another pause, in which he had been wondering if Amy knew his



<P>secret and wanted to talk about it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Never," she answered, with a despondent but decided air.



<P>"Rome took all the vanity out of me, for after seeing the



<P>wonders there, I felt too insignificant to live and gave up



<P>all my foolish hopes in despair."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why should you, with so much energy and talent?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's just why, because talent isn't genius, and no



<P>amount of energy can make it so.&nbsp; I want to be great, or nothing.



<P>I won't be a common-place dauber, so I don't intend to try any more."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And what are you going to do with yourself now, if I may ask?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Polish up my other talents, and be an ornament to society,



<P>if I get the chance."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was a characteristic speech, and sounded daring, but



<P>audacity becomes young people, and Amy's ambition had a good



<P>foundation.&nbsp; Laurie smiled, but he liked the spirit with



<P>which she took up a new purpose when a long-cherished one



<P>died, and spent no time lamenting.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Good!&nbsp; And here is where Fred Vaughn comes in, I fancy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy preserved a discreet silence, but there was a conscious



<P>look in her downcast face that made Laurie sit up and say gravely,



<P>"Now I'm going to play brother, and ask questions.&nbsp; May I?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't promise to answer."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your face will, if your tongue won't.&nbsp; You aren't woman of



<P>the world enough yet to hide your feelings, my dear.&nbsp; I heard



<P>rumors about Fred and you last year, and it's my private opinion



<P>that if he had not been called home so suddenly and detained



<P>so long, something would have come of it, hey?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's not for me to say," was Amy's grim reply, but her lips



<P>would smile, and there was a traitorous sparkle of the eye



<P>which betrayed that she knew her power and enjoyed the knowledge.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are not engaged, I hope?" And Laurie looked very



<P>elder-brotherly and grave all of a sudden.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But you will be, if he comes back and goes properly down



<P>on his knees, won't you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very likely."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then you are fond of old Fred?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I could be, if I tried."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But you don't intend to try till the proper moment? Bless



<P>my soul, what unearthly prudence!&nbsp; He's a good fellow, Amy, but



<P>not the man I fancied you'd like."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He is rich, a gentleman, and has delightful manners,"



<P>began Amy, trying to be quite cool and dignified, but feeling



<P>a little ashamed of herself, in spite of the sincerity of her



<P>intentions.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I understand.&nbsp; Queens of society can't get on without money,



<P>so you mean to make a good match, and start in that way?&nbsp; Quite



<P>right and proper, as the world goes, but it sounds odd from the



<P>lips of one of your mother's girls."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"True, nevertheless."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A short speech, but the quiet decision with which it was



<P>uttered contrasted curiously with the young speaker.&nbsp; Laurie



<P>felt this instinctively and laid himself down again, with a



<P>sense of disappointment which he could not explain.&nbsp; His look



<P>and silence, as well as a certain inward self-disapproval,



<P>ruffled Amy, and made her resolve to deliver her lecture



<P>without delay.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wish you'd do me the favor to rouse yourself a little,"



<P>she said sharply.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do it for me, there's a dear girl."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I could, if I tried."&nbsp; And she looked as if she would like



<P>doing it in the most summary style.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Try, then.&nbsp; I give you leave," returned Laurie, who enjoyed



<P>having someone to tease, after his long abstinence from



<P>his favorite pastime.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You'd be angry in five minutes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm never angry with you.&nbsp; It takes two flints to make a fire.



<P>You are as cool and soft as snow."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You don't know what I can do.&nbsp; Snow produces a glow and a tingle,



<P>if applied rightly.&nbsp; Your indifference is half affectation,



<P>and a good stirring up would prove it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Stir away, it won't hurt me and it may amuse you, as the



<P>big man said when his little wife beat him.&nbsp; Regard me in the



<P>light of a husband or a carpet, and beat till you are tired,



<P>if that sort of exercise agrees with you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Being decidedly nettled herself, and longing to see him



<P>shake off the apathy that so altered him, Amy sharpened both



<P>tongue and pencil, and began.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Flo and I have got a new name for you.&nbsp; It's Lazy Laurence.



<P>How do you like it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She thought it would annoy him, but he only folded his



<P>arms under his head, with an imperturbable, "That's not bad.



<P>Thank you, ladies."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you want to know what I honestly think of you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Pining to be told."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I despise you."



<P>If she had even said `I hate you' in a petulant or coquettish



<P>tone, he would have laughed and rather liked it, but



<P>the grave, almost sad, accent in her voice made him open his



<P>eyes, and ask quickly...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, if you please?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Because, with every chance for being good, useful, and



<P>happy, you are faulty, lazy, and miserable."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Strong language, mademoiselle."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If you like it, I'll go on."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Pray do, it's quite interesting."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I thought you'd find it so.&nbsp; Selfish people always like to



<P>talk about themselves."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Am I selfish?" The question slipped out involuntarily and



<P>in a tone of surprise, for the one virtue on which he prided



<P>himself was generosity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, very selfish," continued Amy, in a calm, cool voice,



<P>twice as effective just then as an angry one.&nbsp; "I'll show you



<P>how, for I've studied you while we were frolicking, and I'm



<P>not at all satisfied with you.&nbsp; Here you have been abroad



<P>nearly six months, and done nothing but waste time and money



<P>and disappoint your friends."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Isn't a fellow to have any pleasure after a four-year



<P>grind?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You don't look as if you'd had much.&nbsp; At any rate, you are



<P>none the better for it, as far as I can see.&nbsp; I said when we



<P>first met that you had improved.&nbsp; Now I take it all back, for I



<P>don't think you half so nice as when I left you at home.&nbsp; You



<P>have grown abominably lazy, you like gossip, and waste time on



<P>frivolous things, you are contented to be petted and admired



<P>by silly people, instead of being loved and respected by wise



<P>ones.&nbsp; With money, talent, position, health, and beauty, ah



<P>you like that old Vanity!&nbsp; But it's the truth, so I can't help



<P>saying it, with all these splendid things to use and enjoy, you



<P>can find nothing to do but dawdle, and instead of being the man



<P>you ought to be, you are only..."&nbsp; There she stopped, with



<P>a look that had both pain and pity in it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Saint Laurence on a gridiron," added Laurie, blandly



<P>finishing the sentence.&nbsp; But the lecture began to take effect,



<P>for there was a wide-awake sparkle in his eyes now and a



<P>half-angry, half-injured expression replaced the former indifference.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I supposed you'd take it so.&nbsp; You men tell us we are



<P>angels, and say we can make you what we will, but the instant



<P>we honestly try to do you good, you laugh at us and won't



<P>listen, which proves how much your flattery is worth." Amy



<P>spoke bitterly, and turned her back on the exasperating



<P>martyr at her feet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In a minute a hand came down over the page, so that she



<P>could not draw, and Laurie's voice said, with a droll imitation



<P>of a penitent child, "I will be good, oh, I will be good!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Amy did not laugh, for she was in earnest, and tapping



<P>on the outspread hand with her pencil, said soberly, "Aren't



<P>you ashamed of a hand like that?&nbsp; It's as soft and white as a



<P>woman's, and looks as if it never did anything but wear Jouvin's



<P>best gloves and pick flowers for ladies.&nbsp; You are not a dandy,



<P>thank Heaven, so I'm glad to see there are no diamonds or big



<P>seal rings on it, only the little old one Jo gave you so long



<P>ago.&nbsp; Dear soul, I wish she was here to help me!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So do I!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The hand vanished as suddenly as it came, and there was



<P>energy enough in the echo of her wish to suit even Amy.&nbsp; She



<P>glanced down at him with a new thought in her mind, but he



<P>was lying with his hat half over his face, as if for shade, and



<P>his mustache hid his mouth.&nbsp; She only saw his chest rise and



<P>fall, with a long breath that might have been a sigh, and the



<P>hand that wore the ring nestled down into the grass, as if to



<P>hide something too precious or too tender to be spoken of.



<P>All in a minute various hints and trifles assumed shape and



<P>significance in Amy's mind, and told her what her sister never



<P>had confided to her.&nbsp; She remembered that Laurie never spoke



<P>voluntarily of Jo, she recalled the shadow on his face just



<P>now, the change in his character, and the wearing of the little



<P>old ring which was no ornament to a handsome hand.&nbsp; Girls are



<P>quick to read such signs and feel their eloquence.&nbsp; Amy had



<P>fancied that perhaps a love trouble was at the bottom of the



<P>alteration, and now she was sure of it.&nbsp; Her keen eyes filled,



<P>and when she spoke again, it was in a voice that could be



<P>beautifully soft and kind when she chose to make it so.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I know I have no right to talk so to you, Laurie, and if



<P>you weren't the sweetest-tempered fellow in the world, you'd be



<P>very angry with me.&nbsp; But we are all so fond and proud of you,



<P>I couldn't bear to think they should be disappointed in you at



<P>home as I have been, though, perhaps they would understand



<P>the change better than I do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think they would," came from under the hat, in a grim



<P>tone, quite as touching as a broken one.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They ought to have told me, and not let me go blundering



<P>and scolding, when I should have been more kind and patient



<P>than ever.&nbsp; I never did like that Miss Randal and now I hate



<P>her!" said artful Amy, wishing to be sure of her facts this time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hang Miss Randal!"&nbsp; And Laurie knocked the hat off his



<P>face with a look that left no doubt of his sentiments toward



<P>that young lady.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I beg pardon, I thought..."&nbsp; And there she paused



<P>diplomatically.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, you didn't, you knew perfectly well I never cared for



<P>anyone but Jo," Laurie said that in his old, impetuous tone,



<P>and turned his face away as he spoke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I did think so, but as they never said anything about it,



<P>and you came away, I supposed I was mistaken.&nbsp; And Jo wouldn't



<P>be kind to you?&nbsp; Why, I was sure she loved you dearly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She was kind, but not in the right way, and it's lucky for



<P>her she didn't love me, if I'm the good-for-nothing fellow you



<P>think me.&nbsp; It's her fault though, and you may tell her so."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The hard, bitter look came back again as he said that, and



<P>it troubled Amy, for she did not know what balm to apply.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was wrong, I didn't know.&nbsp; I'm very sorry I was so cross,



<P>but I can't help wishing you'd bear it better, Teddy, dear."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't, that's her name for me!"&nbsp; And Laurie put up his



<P>hand with a quick gesture to stop the words spoken in Jo's



<P>half-kind, half-reproachful tone.&nbsp; "Wait till you've tried it



<P>yourself," he added in a low voice, as he pulled up the grass



<P>by the handful.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'd take it manfully, and be respected if i couldn't be



<P>loved," said Amy, with the decision of one who knew nothing



<P>about it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, Laurie flattered himself that he had borne it remarkably



<P>well, making no moan, asking no sympathy, and taking his



<P>trouble away to live it down alone.&nbsp; Amy's lecture put the



<P>Matter in a new light, and for the first time it did look



<P>weak and selfish to lose heart at the first failure, and shut



<P>himself up in moody indifference.&nbsp; He felt as if suddenly



<P>shaken out of a pensive dream and found it impossible to go



<P>to sleep again.&nbsp; Presently he sat up and asked slowly, "Do



<P>you think Jo would despise me as you do?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, if she saw you now.&nbsp; She hates lazy people.&nbsp; Why don't



<P>you do something splendid, and make her love you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I did my best, but it was no use."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Graduating well, you mean?&nbsp; That was no more than you



<P>ought to have done, for your grandfather's sake.&nbsp; It would



<P>have been shameful to fail after spending so much time and



<P>money, when everyone knew that you could do well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I did fail, say what you will, for Jo wouldn't love me,"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>began Laurie, leaning his head on his hand in a despondent



<P>attitude.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, you didn't, and you'll say so in the end, for it did



<P>you good, and proved that you could do something if you tried.



<P>If you'd only set about another task of some sort, you'd soon



<P>be your hearty, happy self again, and forget your trouble."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's impossible."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Try it and see.&nbsp; You needn't shrug your shoulders, and



<P>think, `Much she knows about such things'.&nbsp; I don't pretend



<P>to be wise, but I am observing, and I see a great deal more



<P>than you'd imagine.&nbsp; I'm interested in other people's experiences



<P>and inconsistencies, and though I can't explain, I remember



<P>and use them for my own benefit.&nbsp; Love Jo all your days,



<P>if you choose, but don't let it spoil you, for it's wicked



<P>to throw away so many good gifts because you can't have the



<P>one you want.&nbsp; There, I won't lecture any more, for I know



<P>you'll wake up and be a man in spite of that hardhearted girl."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Neither spoke for several minutes.&nbsp; Laurie sat turning



<P>the little ring on his finger, and Amy put the last touches to



<P>the hasty sketch she had been working at while she talked.



<P>Presently she put it on his knee, merely saying, "How do you



<P>like that?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He looked and then he smiled, as he could not well help



<P>doing, for it was capitally done, the long, lazy figure on the



<P>grass, with listless face, half-shut eyes, and one hand holding



<P>a cigar, from which came the little wreath of smoke that encircled



<P>the dreamer's head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How well you draw!" he said, with a genuine surprise



<P>and pleasure at her skill, adding, with a half-laugh,



<P>"Yes, that's me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"As you are.&nbsp; This is as you were."&nbsp; And Amy laid another



<P>sketch beside the one he held.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was not nearly so well done, but there was a life and



<P>spirit in it which atoned for many faults, and it recalled the



<P>past so vividly that a sudden change swept over the young



<P>man's face as he looked.&nbsp; Only a rough sketch of Laurie taming



<P>a horse.&nbsp; Hat and coat were off, and every line of the active



<P>figure, resolute face, and commanding attitude was full of



<P>energy and meaning.&nbsp; The handsome brute, just subdued, stood



<P>arching his neck under the tightly drawn rein, with one foot



<P>impatiently pawing the ground, and ears pricked up as if



<P>listening for the voice that had mastered him.&nbsp; In the ruffled



<P>mane.&nbsp; The rider's breezy hair and erect attitude, there was a



<P>suggestion of suddenly arrested motion, of strength, courage,



<P>and youthful buoyancy that contrasted sharply with the supine



<P>grace of the `DOLCE FAR NIENTE' sketch.&nbsp; Laurie said nothing



<P>but as his eye went from one to the other, Amy say him flush



<P>up and fold his lips together as if he read and accepted the



<P>little lesson she had given him.&nbsp; That satisfied her, and



<P>without waiting for him to speak, she said, in her sprightly



<P>way...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't you remember the day you played Rarey with Puck,



<P>and we all looked on?&nbsp; Meg and Beth were frightened, but Jo



<P>clapped and pranced, and I sat on the fence and drew you.&nbsp; I



<P>found that sketch in my portfolio the other day, touched it



<P>up, and kept it to show you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Much obliged.&nbsp; You've improved immensely since then,



<P>and I congratulate you.&nbsp; May I venture to suggest in ` a



<P>honeymoon paradise' that five o'clock is the dinner hour at



<P>your hotel?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie rose as he spoke, returned the pictures with a smile



<P>and a bow and looked at his watch, as if to remind her that



<P>even moral lectures should have an end.&nbsp; He tried to resume his



<P>former easy, indifferent air, but it was an affectation now, for



<P>the rousing had been more effacious than he would confess.&nbsp; Amy



<P>felt the shade of coldness in his manner, and said to herself .&nbsp;

..

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now, I've offended him.&nbsp; Well, if it does him good, I'm



<P>glad, if it makes him hate me, I'm sorry, but it's true, and



<P>I can't take back a word of it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They laughed and chatted all the way home, and little



<P>Baptist, up behind, thought that monsieur and madamoiselle



<P>were in charming spirits.&nbsp; But both felt ill at ease.&nbsp; The



<P>friendly frankness was disturbed, the sunshine had a shadow



<P>over it, and despite their apparent gaiety, there was a secret



<P>discontent in the heart of each.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Shall we see you this evening, mon frere?" asked Amy, as



<P>they parted at her aunt's door.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Unfortunately I have an engagement.&nbsp; Au revoir, madamoiselle."



<P>And Laurie bent as if to kiss her hand, in the foreign fashion,



<P>which became him better than many men.&nbsp; Something in his face



<P>made Amy say quickly and warmly...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, be yourself with me, Laurie, and part in the good old way.



<P>I'd rather have a hearty English handshake than all the



<P>sentimental salutations in France."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Goodbye, dear." And with these words, uttered in the tone she liked,



<P>Laurie left her, after a handshake almost painful in its heartiness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Next morning, instead of the usual call, Amy received a



<P>note which made her smile at the beginning and sigh at the end.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>My Dear Mentor,



<P>Please make my adieux to your aunt, and exult within



<P>yourself, for `Lazy Laurence' has gone to his grandpa, like



<P>the best of boys.&nbsp; A pleasant winter to you, and may the gods



<P>grant you a blissful honeymoon at Valrosa!&nbsp; I think Fred



<P>would be benefited by a rouser.&nbsp; Tell him so, with my congratulations.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Yours gratefully, Telemachus

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Good boy!&nbsp; I'm glad he's gone," said Amy, with an approving smile.



<P>The next minute her face fell as she glanced about the empty room,



<P>adding, with an involuntary sigh, "Yes, I am glad, but how I shall miss

him."

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie lay luxuriously swinging to and fro in his hammock



<P>one warm September afternoon, wondering what his neighbors were



<P>about, but too lazy to go and find out.&nbsp; He was in one of his



<P>moods, for the day had been both unprofitable and unsatisfactory,



<P>and he was wishing he could live it over again.&nbsp; The hot weather



<P>made him indolent, and he had shirked his studies, tried Mr.



<P>Brooke's patience to the utmost, displeased his grandfather by



<P>practicing half the afternoon, frightened the maidservants half



<P>out of their wits by mischievously hinting that one of his dogs



<P>was going mad, and, after high words with the stableman about



<P>some fancied neglect of his horse, he had flung himself into



<P>his hammock to fume over the stupidity of the world in general,



<P>till the peace of the lovely day quieted him in spite of himself.



<P>Staring up into the green gloom of the horse-chestnut trees above



<P>him, he dreamed dreams of all sorts, and was just imagining



<P>himself tossing on the ocean in a voyage round the world,



<P>when the sound of voices brought him ashore in a flash.



<P>Peeping through the meshes of the hammock, he saw the Marches



<P>coming out, as if bound on some expedition.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What in the world are those girls about now?" thought



<P>Laurie, opening his sleepy eyes to take a good look, for there



<P>was something rather peculiar in the appearance of his



<P>neighbors.&nbsp; Each wore a large, flapping hat, a brown linen pouch



<P>slung over one shoulder, and carried a long staff.&nbsp; Meg had a



<P>cushion, Jo a book, Beth a basket, and Amy a portfolio.&nbsp; All



<P>walked quietly through the garden, out at the little back gate,



<P>and began to climb the hill that lay between the house and river.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, that's cool," said Laurie to himself, "to have a picnic



<P>and never ask me!&nbsp; They can't be going in the boat, for they



<P>haven't got the key.&nbsp; Perhaps they forgot it.&nbsp; I'll take it

to them,



<P>and see what's going on."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Though possessed of half a dozen hats, it took him some time



<P>to find one, then there was a hunt for the key, which was at last



<P>discovered in his pocket, so that the girls were quite out of sight



<P>when leaped the fence and ran after them.&nbsp; Taking the shortest

way



<P>to the boathouse, he waited for them to appear, but no one came,



<P>and he went up the hill to take an observation.&nbsp; A grove of pines



<P>covered one part of it, and from the heart of this green spot came



<P>a clearer sound than the soft sigh of the pines or the drowsy chirp



<P>of the crickets.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here's a landscape!" thought Laurie, peeping through the



<P>bushes, and looking wide-awake and good-natured already.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was a rather pretty little picture, for the sisters sat



<P>together in the shady nook, with sun and shadow flickering over



<P>them, the aromatic wind lifting their hair and cooling their hot



<P>cheeks, and all the little wood people going on with their affairs



<P>as if these were no strangers but old friends.&nbsp; Meg sat upon her



<P>cushion, sewing daintily with her white hands, and looking as fresh



<P>and sweet as a rose in her pink dress among the green.&nbsp; Beth was



<P>sorting the cones that lay thick under the hemlock near by, for



<P>she made pretty things with them.&nbsp; Amy was sketching a group of



<P>ferns, and Jo was knitting as she read aloud.&nbsp; A shadow passed



<P>over the boy's face as he watched them, feeling that he ought to



<P>go away because uninvited, yet lingering because home seemed very



<P>lonely and this quiet party in the woods most attractive to his



<P>restless spirit.&nbsp; He stood so still that a squirrel, busy with

it's



<P>harvesting, ran dawn a pine close beside him, saw him suddenly



<P>and skipped back, scolding so shrilly that Beth looked up, espied



<P>the wistful face behind the birches, and beckoned with a reassuring



<P>smile.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"May I come in, please?&nbsp; Or shall I be a bother?" he asked,



<P>advancing slowly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg lifted her eyebrows, but Jo scowled at her defiantly and



<P>said at once, "Of course you may.&nbsp; We should have asked you before,



<P>only we thought you wouldn't care for such a girl's game as this."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I always like your games, but if Meg doesn't want me, I'll



<P>go away."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I've no objection, if you do something.&nbsp; It's against the



<P>rules to be idle here," replied Meg gravely but graciously.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Much obliged.&nbsp; I'll do anything if you'll let me stop a bit,



<P>for it's as dull as the Desert of Sahara down there.&nbsp; Shall I sew,



<P>read, cone, draw, or do all at once? Bring on your bears.



<P>I'm ready."&nbsp; And Laurie sat down with a submissive expression



<P>delightful to behold.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Finish this story while I set my heel," said Jo, handing him



<P>the book.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes'm." was the meek answer, as he began, doing his best to



<P>prove his gratitude for the favor of admission into the `Busy Bee



<P>Society'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The story was not a long one, and when it was finished, he



<P>ventured to ask a few questions as a reward of merit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Please, ma'am, could I inquire if this highly instructive



<P>and charming institution is a new one?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Would you tell him?" asked Meg of her sisters.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He'll laugh," said Amy warningly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Who cares?" said Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I guess he'll like it," added Beth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Of course I shall!&nbsp; I give you my word I won't laugh.&nbsp; Tell



<P>away, Jo, and don't be afraid."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The idea of being afraid of you!&nbsp; Well, you see we used to



<P>play Pilgrim's Progress, and we have been going on with it in



<P>earnest, all winter and summer."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, I know," said Laurie, nodding wisely.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Who told you?" demanded Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Spirits."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I did.&nbsp; I wanted to amuse him one night when you were



<P>all away, and he was rather dismal.&nbsp; He did like it, so don't



<P>scold, Jo," said Beth meekly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You can't keep a secret.&nbsp; Never mind, it saves trouble now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Go on, please," said Laurie, as Jo became absorbed in her



<P>work, looking a trifle displeased.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, didn't she tell you about this new plan of ours?&nbsp; Well,



<P>we have tried not to waste our holiday, but each has had a task



<P>and worked at it with a will.&nbsp; The vacation is nearly over, the



<P>stints are all done, and we are ever so glad that we didn't dawdle."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, I should think so," and Laurie thought regretfully of



<P>his own idle days.



<P>"Mother likes to have us out-of-doors as much as possible, so



<P>we bring our work here and have nice times.&nbsp; For the fun of it

we



<P>bring our things in these bags, wear the old hats, use poles to



<P>climb the hill, and play pilgrims, as we used to do years ago.&nbsp;

We



<P>call this hill the Delectable Mountain, for we can look far away



<P>and see the country where we hope to live some time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo pointed, and Laurie sat up to examine, for through an



<P>opening in the wood one could look cross the wide, blue river,



<P>the meadows on the other side, far over the outskirts of the



<P>great city, to the green hills that rose to meet the sky.&nbsp; The



<P>sun was low, and the heavens glowed with the splendor of an



<P>autumn sunset.&nbsp; Gold and purple clouds lay on the hilltops,



<P>and rising high into the ruddy light were silvery white peaks



<P>that shone like the airy spires of some Celestial City.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How beautiful that is!" said Laurie softly, for he was quick



<P>to see and feel beauty of any kind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's often so, and we like to watch it, for it is never the



<P>same, but always splendid," replied Amy, wishing she could paint it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Jo talks about the country where we hope to live sometime--the



<P>real country, she means, with pigs and chickens and haymaking.



<P>It would be nice, but I wish the beautiful country up there was real,



<P>and we could ever go to it," said Beth musingly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is a lovelier country even than that, where we shall go,



<P>by-and-by, when we are good enough," answered Meg with her sweetest

voice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It seems so long to wait, so hard to do.&nbsp; I want to fly away



<P>at once, as those swallows fly, and go in at that splendid gate."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You'll get there, Beth, sooner or later, no fear of that,"



<P>said Jo.&nbsp; "I'm the one that will have to fight and work, and climb



<P>and wait, and maybe never get in after all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"you'll have me for company, if that's any comfort.&nbsp; I shall



<P>have to do a deal of traveling before I come in sight of your



<P>Celestial City.&nbsp; If I arrive late, you'll say a good word for me,



<P>won't you, Beth?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Something in the boy's face troubled his little friend, but



<P>she said cheerfully, with her quiet eyes on the changing clouds,



<P>"If people really want to go, and really try all their lives, I



<P>think they will get in, for I don't believe there are any locks



<P>on that door or any guards at the gate.&nbsp; I always imagine it is



<P>as it is in the picture, where the shining ones stretch out their



<P>hands to welcome poor Christian as he comes up from the river.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Wouldn't it be fun if all the castles in the air which we



<P>make could come true, and we could live in them?" said Jo, after



<P>a little pause.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I've made such quantities it would be hard to choose which



<P>I'd have," said Laurie, lying flat and throwing cones at the



<P>squirrel who had betrayed him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You'd have to take your favorite one.&nbsp; What is it?" asked



<P>Meg.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If I tell mine, will you tell yours?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, if the girls will too."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We will.&nbsp; Now, Laurie."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"After I'd seen as much of the world as I want to, I'd like



<P>to settle in Germany and have just as much music as I choose.&nbsp;

I'm



<P>to be a famous musician myself, and all creation is to rush to hear



<P>me.&nbsp; And I'm never to be bothered about money or business, but

just



<P>enjoy myself and live for what I like.&nbsp; That's my favorite castle.



<P>What's yours, Meg?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Margaret seemed to find it a little hard to tell hers, and



<P>waved a brake before her face, as if to disperse imaginary gnats,



<P>while she said slowly, "I should like a lovely house, full of all



<P>sorts of luxurious things--nice food, pretty clothes, handsome



<P>furniture, pleasant people, and heaps of money.&nbsp; I am to be



<P>mistress of it, and manage it as I like, with plenty of servants,



<P>so I never need work a bit.&nbsp; How I should enjoy it!&nbsp; For I

wouldn't



<P>be idle, but do good, and make everyone love me dearly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Wouldn't you have a master for your castle in the air?" asked



<P>Laurie slyly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I said `pleasant people', you know," And Meg carefully tied



<P>up her shoe as she spoke, so that no one saw her face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why don't you say you'd have a splendid, wise, good husband



<P>and some angelic little children?&nbsp; You know your castle wouldn't



<P>be perfect without," said blunt Jo, who had no tender fancies yet,



<P>and rather scorned romance, except in books.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You'd have nothing but horses, inkstands, and novels in



<P>yours," answered Meg petulantly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Wouldn't I though?&nbsp; I'd have a stable full of Arabian steeds,



<P>rooms piled high with books, and I'd write out of a magic inkstand,



<P>so that my works should be as famous as Laurie's music.&nbsp; I want

to



<P>do something splendid before I go into my castle, something heroic



<P>or wonderful that won't be forgotten after I'm dead.&nbsp; I don't know



<P>what, but I'm on the watch for it, and mean to astonish you all



<P>some day.&nbsp; I think I shall write books, and get rich and famous,



<P>that would suit me, so that is my favorite dream."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mine is to stay at home safe with Father and Mother, and



<P>help take care of the family," said Beth contentedly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't you wish for anything else?" asked Laurie.



<P>"Since I had my little piano, I am perfectly satisfied.&nbsp; I



<P>only wish we may all keep well and be together, nothing else."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have ever so many wishes, but the pet one is to be an



<P>artist, and go to Rome, and do fine pictures, and be the best



<P>artist in the whole world," was Amy's modest desire.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We're an ambitious set, aren't we?&nbsp; Every one of us, but



<P>Beth, wants to be rich and famous, and gorgeous in every respect.



<P>I do wonder if any of us will ever get our wishes," said Laurie,



<P>chewing grass like a meditative calf.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I've got the key to my castle in the air, but whether I can



<P>unlock the door remains to be seen," observed Jo mysteriously.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I've got the key to mine, but I'm not allowed to try it.



<P>Hang college!" muttered Laurie with an impatient sigh.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here's mine!" and Amy waved her pencil.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I haven't got any," said Meg forlornly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, you have," said Laurie at once.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Where?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"In your face."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nonsense, that's of no use."



<P>"Wait and see if it doesn't bring you something worth having,"



<P>replied the boy, laughing at the thought of a charming little



<P>secret which he fancied he knew.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg colored behind the brake, but asked no questions and



<P>looked across the river with the same expectant expression which



<P>Mr. Brooke had worn when he told the story of the knight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If we are all alive ten years hence, let's meet, and see how



<P>many of us have got our wishes, or how much nearer we are then than



<P>now," said Jo, always ready with a plan.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Bless me!&nbsp; How old I shall be, twenty-seven!" exclaimed Meg,



<P>who felt grown up already, having just reached seventeen.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You and I will be twenty-six, Teddy, Beth twenty-four, and



<P>Amy twenty-two.&nbsp; What a venerable party!" said Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hope I shall have done something to be proud of by that



<P>time, but I'm such a lazy dog, I'm afraid I shall dawdle, Jo."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You need a motive, Mother says, and when you get it, she is



<P>sure you'll work splendidly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Is she?&nbsp; By Jupiter, I will, if I only get the chance!" cried



<P>Laurie, sitting up with sudden energy.&nbsp; "I ought to be satisfied

to



<P>please Grandfather, and I do try, but it's working against the grain,



<P>you see, and comes hard.&nbsp; He wants me to be an India merchant,

as he



<P>was, and I'd rather be shot.&nbsp; I hate tea and sild and spices, and



<P>every sort of rubbish his old ships bring, and I don't care how soon



<P>they go to the bottom when I own them.&nbsp; Going to college ought

to



<P>satisfy him, for if I give him four years he ought to let me off



<P>from the business.&nbsp; But he's set, and I've got to do just as he

did,



<P>unless I break away and please myself, as my father did.&nbsp; If there



<P>was anyone left to stay with the old gentleman, I'd do it tomorrow."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie spoke excitedly, and looked ready to carry his threat



<P>into execution on the slightest provocation, for he was growing up



<P>very fast and, in spite of his indolent ways, had a young man's



<P>hatred of subjection, a young man's restless longing to try the



<P>world for himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I advise you to sail away in one of your ships, and never



<P>come home again till you have tried your own way," said Jo, whose



<P>imagination was fired by the thought of such a daring exploit, and



<P>whose sympathy was excited by what she called `Teddy's Wrongs'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's not right, Jo.&nbsp; You mustn't talk in that way, and Laurie



<P>mustn't take your bad advice.&nbsp; You should do just what your



<P>grandfather wishes, my dear boy," said Meg in her most maternal tone.



<P>"Do your best at college, and when he sees that you try to please him,



<P>I'm sure he won't be hard on you or unjust to you.&nbsp; As you say,

there



<P>is no one else to stay with and love him, and you'd never forgive



<P>yourself if you left him without his permission.&nbsp; Don't be dismal

or



<P>fret, but do your duty and you'll get your reward, as good Mr. Brooke



<P>has, by being respected and loved."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What do you know about him?" asked Laurie, grateful for the



<P>good advice, but objecting to the lecture, and glad to turn the



<P>conversation from himself after his unusual outbreak.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Only what your grandpa told us about him, how he took good



<P>care of his own mother till she died, and wouldn't go abroad as



<P>tutor to some nice person because he wouldn't leave her.&nbsp; And how



<P>he provides now for an old woman who nursed his mother, and never



<P>tells anyone, but is just as generous and patient and good as he



<P>can be."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So he is, dear old fellow!" said Laurie heartily, as Meg



<P>paused, looking flushed and earnest with her story.&nbsp; "It's like



<P>Grandpa to find out all about him without letting him know, and



<P>to tell all his goodness to others, so that they might like him.



<P>Brooke couldn't understand why your mother was so kind to him,



<P>asking him over with me and treating him in her beautiful friendly



<P>way.&nbsp; He thought she was just perfect, and talked about it for



<P>days and days, and went on about you all in flaming style.&nbsp; If

ever



<P>I do get my wish, you see what I'll do for Booke."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Begin to do something now by not plaguing his life out,"



<P>said Meg sharply.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How do you know I do, Miss?"



<P>"I can always tell by his face when he goes away.&nbsp; If you



<P>have been good, he looks satisfied and walks briskly.&nbsp; If you



<P>have plagued him, he's sober and walks slowly, as if he wanted



<P>to go back and do his work better."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I like that?&nbsp; So you keep an account of my good and



<P>bad marks in Brooke's face, do you?&nbsp; I see him bow and smile as



<P>he passes your window, but I didn't know you'd got up a telegraph."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We haven't.&nbsp; Don't be angry, and oh, don't tell him I said



<P>anything!&nbsp; It was only to show that I cared how you get on, and



<P>what is said here is said in confidence, you know," cried Meg,



<P>much alarmed at the thought of what might follow from her



<P>careless speech.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't tell tales," replied Laurie, with his `high and mighty'



<P>air, as Jo called a certain expression which he occasionally wore.



<P>"Only if Brooke is going to be a thermometer, I must mind and have



<P>fair weather for him to report."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Please don't be offended.&nbsp; I didn't meant to preach or tell



<P>tales or be silly.&nbsp; I only thought Jo was encouraging you in a



<P>feeling which you'd be sorry for by-and-by.&nbsp; You are so kind to



<P>us, we feel as if you were our brother and say just what we think.



<P>Forgive me, I meant it kindly."&nbsp; And Meg offered her hand with

a



<P>gesture both affectionate and timid.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Ashamed of his momentary pique, Laurie squeezed the kind



<P>little hand, and said frankly, "I'm the one to be forgiven.&nbsp; I'm



<P>cross and have been out of sorts all day.&nbsp; I like to have you



<P>tell me my faults and be sisterly, so don't mind if I am grumpy



<P>sometimes.&nbsp; I thank you all the same."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Bent on showing that he was not offended, he made himself as



<P>agreeable as possible, wound cotton for Meg, recited poetry to



<P>please Jo, shook down cones for Beth, and helped Amy with her



<P>ferns, proving himself a fit person to belong to the `Busy Bee



<P>Society'.&nbsp; In the midst of an animated discussion on the domestic



<P>habits of turtles (one of those amiable creatures having strolled



<P>up from the river), the faint sound of a bell warned them that



<P>Hannah had put the tea `to draw', and they would just have time



<P>to get home to supper.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"May I come again?" asked Laurie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, if your are good, and love your book, as the boys in



<P>the primer are told to do," said Meg, smiling.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"i'll try."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then you may come, and I'll teach you to knit as the Scotchmen do.



<P>There's a demand for socks just now," added Jo, waving hers



<P>like a big blue worsted banner as they parted at the gate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That night, when Beth played to Mr. Laurence in the twilight,



<P>Laurie, standing in the shadow of the curtain, listened to the



<P>little David, whose simple music always quieted his moody spirit,



<P>and watched the old man, who sat with his gray head on his hand,



<P>thinking tender thoughts of the dead child he had loved so much.



<P>Remembering the conversation of the afternoon, the boy said to



<P>himself, with the resolve to make the sacrifice cheerfully, "I'll



<P>let my castle go, and stay with the dear old gentleman while he



<P>needs me, for I am all he has."

<P>"That boy is a perfect cyclops, isn't he?" said Amy one day,



<P>as Laurie clattered by on horseback, with a flourish of his whip



<P>as he passed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How dare you say so, when he's got both his eyes?&nbsp; And



<P>very handsome ones they are, too," cried Jo, who resented any



<P>slighting remarks about her friend.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I didn't day anything about his eyes, and I don't see why



<P>you need fire up when I admire his riding."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, my goodness!&nbsp; That little goose means a centaur, and she



<P>called him a Cyclops," exclaimed Jo, with a burst of laughter.



<P>"You needn't be so rude, it's only a `lapse of lingy', as Mr.



<P>Davis says," retorted Amy, finishing Jo with her Latin.&nbsp; "I just



<P>wish I had a little of the money Laurie spends on that horse," she



<P>added, as if to herself, yet hoping her sisters would hear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why?" asked Meg kindly, for Jo had gone off in another laugh



<P>at Amy's second blunder.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I need it so much.&nbsp; I'm dreadfully in debt, and it won't be



<P>my turn to have the rag money for a month."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"In debt, Amy?&nbsp; What do you mean?" And Meg looked sober.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, I owe at least a dozen pickled limes, and I can't pay



<P>them, you know, till I have money, for Marmee forbade my having



<P>anything charged at the shop."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Tell me all about it.&nbsp; Are limes the fashion now?&nbsp; It used



<P>to be pricking bits of rubber to make balls."&nbsp; And Meg tried to



<P>keep her countenance, Amy looked so grave and important.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, you see, the girls are always buying them, and unless



<P>you want to be thought mean, you must do it too.&nbsp; It's nothing



<P>but limes now, for everyone is sucking them in their desks in



<P>schooltime, and trading them off for pencils, bead rings, paper



<P>dolls, or something else, at recess.&nbsp; If one girl likes another,



<P>she gives her a lime.&nbsp; If she's mad with her, she eats one before



<P>her face, and doesn't offer even a suck.&nbsp; They treat by turns,



<P>and I've had ever so many but haven't returned them, and I ought



<P>for they are debts of honor, you know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How much will pay them off and restore your credit?" asked



<P>Meg, taking out her purse."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A quarter would more than do it, and leave a few cents over



<P>for a treat for you.&nbsp; Don't you like limes?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not much.&nbsp; You may have my share.&nbsp; Here's the money.&nbsp;

Make it



<P>last as long as you can, for it isn't very plenty, you know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, thank you!&nbsp; It must be so nice to have pocket money!&nbsp;

I'll



<P>have a grand feast, for I haven't tasted a lime this week.&nbsp; I felt



<P>delicate about taking any, as I couldn't return them, and I'm



<P>actually suffering for one."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Next day Amy was rather late at school, but could not resist the



<P>temptation of displaying, with pardonable pride, a moist brown-paper



<P>parcel, before she consigned it to the inmost recesses of her desk.



<P>During the next few minutes the rumor that Amy March had got twenty-



<P>four delicious limes (she ate one on the way) and was going to



<P>treat circulated through her `set', and the attentions of her friends



<P>became quite overwhelming.&nbsp; Katy Brown invited her to her next

party



<P>on the spot.&nbsp; Mary Kinglsey insisted on lending her her watch till



<P>recess, and Jenny Snow, a satirical young lady, who had basely twitted



<P>Amy upon her limeless state, promptly buried the hatchet and offered



<P>to furnish answers to certain appalling sums.&nbsp; But Amy had not



<P>forgotten Miss Snow's cutting remarks about `some persons whose noses



<P>were not too flat to smell other people's limes, and stuck-up people



<P>who were not too proud to ask for them', and she instantly crushed



<P>`that Snow girl's' hopes by the withering telegram, "You needn't be



<P>so polite all of a sudden, for you won't get any."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A distinguished personage happened to visit the school that



<P>morning, and Amy's beautifully drawn maps received praise, which



<P>honor to her foe rankled in the soul of Miss Snow, and caused Miss



<P>March to assume the airs of a studious young peacock.&nbsp; But, alas,



<P>alas!&nbsp; Pride goes before a fall, and the revengeful Snow turned

the



<P>tables with disastrous success.&nbsp; No sooner had the guest paid the



<P>usual stale compliments and bowed himself out, than Jenny, under



<P>pretense of asking an important question, informed Mr. Davis, the



<P>teacher, that Amy March had pickled limes in her desk.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now Mr. Davis had declared limes a contraband article, and



<P>solemnly vowed to publicly ferrule the first person who was found



<P>breaking the law.&nbsp; This much-enduring man had succeeded in banishing



<P>chewing gum after a long and stormy war, had made a bonfire of the



<P>confiscated novels and newspapers, had suppressed a private post



<P>office, had forbidden distortions of the face, nicknames, and



<P>caricatures, and done all that one man could do to keep half a hundred



<P>rebellious girls in order.&nbsp; Boys are trying enough to human patience,



<P>goodness knows, but girls are infinitely more so, especially to



<P>nervous gentlemen with tyrannical tempers and no more talent for



<P>teaching than Dr. Blimber.&nbsp; Mr. Davis knew any quantity of Greek,



<P>Latin, algebra, and ologies of all sorts so he was called a fine



<P>teacher, and manners, morals, feelings, and examples were not



<P>considered of any particular importance.&nbsp; It was a most unfortunate



<P>moment for denouncing Amy, and Jenny knew it.&nbsp; Mr. Davis had



<P>evidently taken his coffee too strong that morning, there was an



<P>east wind, which always affected his neuralgia, and his pupils had



<P>not done him the credit which he felt he deserved.&nbsp; Therefore,

to



<P>use the expressive, if not elegant, language of a schoolgirl, "He



<P>was as nervous as a witch and as cross as a bear".&nbsp; The word `limes'



<P>was like fire to powder, his yellow face flushed, and he rapped on



<P>his desk with an energy which made Jenny skip to her seat with



<P>unusual rapidity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Young ladies, attention, if you please!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At the stern order the buzz ceased, and fifty pairs of blue,



<P>black, gray, and brown eyes were obediently fixed upon his awful



<P>countenance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Miss March, come to the desk."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy rose to comply with outward composure, but a secret fear



<P>oppressed her, for the limes weighed upon her conscience.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Bring with you the limes you have in your desk," was the



<P>unexpected command which arrested her before she got out of her seat.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't take all." whispered her neighbor, a young lady of great



<P>presence of mind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy hastily shook out half a dozen and laid the rest down before



<P>Mr. Davis, feeling that any man possessing a human heart would relent



<P>when that delicious perfume met his nose.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Mr. Davis



<P>particularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle, and disgust



<P>added to his wrath.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Is that all?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not quite," stammered Amy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Bring the rest immediately."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With a despairing glance at her set, she obeyed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are sure there are no more?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I never lie, sir."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So I see.&nbsp; Now take these disgusting things two by two, and



<P>throw them out of the window."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a simultaneous sigh, which created quite a little gust,



<P>as the last hope fled, and the treat was ravished from their longing



<P>lips.&nbsp; Scarlet with shame and anger, Amy went to and fro six dreadful



<P>times, and as each doomed couple, looking oh, so plump and juicy, fell



<P>from her reluctant hands, a shout from the street completed the anguish



<P>of the girls, for it told them that their feast was being exulted over



<P>by the little Irish children, who were their sworn foes.&nbsp; This--this



<P>was too much.&nbsp; All flashed indignant or appealing glances at the



<P>inexorable Davis, and one passionate lime lover burst into tears.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As Amy returned from her last trip, Mr. Davis gave a portentous



<P>"Hem!" and said, in his most impressive manner...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Young ladies, you remember what I said to you a week ago.&nbsp; I



<P>am sorry this has happened, but I never allow my rules to be infringed,



<P>and I never break my word.&nbsp; Miss March, hold out your hand."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy started, and put both hands behind her, turning on him an



<P>imploring look which pleaded for her better than the words she could



<P>not utter.&nbsp; She was rather a favorite with `old Davis', as, of

course,



<P>he was called, and it's my private belief that he would have broken



<P>his word if the indignation of one irrepressible young lady had not



<P>found vent in a hiss.&nbsp; That hiss, faint as it was, irritated the



<P>irascible gentleman, and sealed the culprit's fate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your hand, Miss March!" was the only answer her mute appeal



<P>received, and too proud to cry or beseech, Amy set her teeth, threw



<P>bach her head defiantly, and bore without flinching several tingling



<P>blows on her little palm.&nbsp; They were neither many nor heavy, but

that



<P>made no difference to her.&nbsp; For the first time in her life she

had



<P>been struck, and the disgrace, in her eyes, was as deep as if he had



<P>knocked her down.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You will now stand on the platform till recess," said Mr. Davis,



<P>resolved to do the thing thoroughly, since he had begun.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That was dreadful.&nbsp; It would have been bad enough to go to her



<P>seat, and see the pitying faces of her friends, or the satisfied



<P>ones of her few enemies, but to face the whole school, with that



<P>shame fresh upon her, seemed impossible, and for a second she felt



<P>as if she could only drop down where she stood, and break her heart



<P>with crying.&nbsp; A bitter sense of wrong and the thought of Jenny

Snow



<P>helped her to bear it, and, taking the ignominious place, she fixed



<P>her eyes on the stove funnel above what now seemed a sea of faces,



<P>and stood there, so motionless and white that the girls found it



<P>hard to study with that pathetic figure before them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>During the fifteen minutes that followed, the proud and sensitive



<P>little girl suffered a shame and pain which she never forgot.&nbsp;

To



<P>others it might seem a ludicrous or trivial affair, but to her it was



<P>a hard experience, for during the twelve years of her life she had been



<P>governed by love alone, and a blow of that sort had never touched her



<P>before.&nbsp; The smart of her hand and the ache of her heart were forgotten



<P>in the sting of the thought, "I shall have to tell at home, and they



<P>will be so disappointed in me!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The fifteen minutes seemed an hour, but they came to an end at



<P>last, and the word `Recess!' had never seemed so welcome to her before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You can go, Miss March," said Mr. Davis, looking, as he felt,



<P>uncomfortable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He did not soon forget the reproachful glance Amy gave him, as



<P>she went, without a word to anyone, straight into the anteroom,



<P>snatched her things, and left the place "forever," as she passionately



<P>declared to herself.&nbsp; She was in a sad state when she got home,

and



<P>when the older girls arrived, some time later, an indignation meeting



<P>was held at once.&nbsp; Mrs. March did not say much but looked disturbed,



<P>and comforted her afflicted little daughter in her tenderest manner.



<P>Meg bathed the insulted hand with glycerine and tears, Beth felt



<P>that even her beloved kittens would fail as a balm for griefs like



<P>this, Jo wrathfully proposed that Mr. Davis be arrested without delay,



<P>and Hannah shook her fist at the `villain' and pounded potatoes for



<P>dinner as if she had him under her pestle.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>No notice was taken of Amy's flight, except by her mates, but



<P>the sharp-eyed demoiselles discovered that Mr. Davis was quite



<P>benignant in the afternoon, also unusually nervous.&nbsp; Just before



<P>school closed, Jo appeared, wearing a grim expression as she



<P>stalked up to the desk, and delivered a letter from her mother,



<P>then collected Amy's property, and departed, carefully scraping



<P>the mud from her boots on the door mat, as if she shook that dust



<P>of the place off her feet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, you can have a vacation from school, but I want you to



<P>study a little every day with Beth," said Mrs. March that evening.



<P>"I don't approve of corporal punishment, especially for girls.&nbsp;

I



<P>dislike Mr. Davis's manner of teaching and don't think the girls



<P>you associate with are doing you any good, so I shall ask your



<P>father's advice before I send you anywhere else."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's good!&nbsp; I wish all the girls would leave, and spoil



<P>his old school.&nbsp; It's perfectly maddening to think of those lovely



<P>limes," sighed Amy, with the air of a martyr.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am not sorry you lost them, for you broke the rules, and



<P>deserved some punishment for disobedience," was the severe reply,



<P>which rather disappointed the young lady, who expected nothing but



<P>sympathy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you mean you are glad I was disgraced before the whole



<P>school?" cried Amy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I should not have chosen that way of mending a fault,"



<P>replied her mother, "but I'm not sure that it won't do you more



<P>good than a molder method.&nbsp; You are getting to be rather conceited,



<P>my dear, and it is quite time you set about correcting it.&nbsp; You



<P>have a good many little gifts and virtues, but there is no need of



<P>parading them, for conceit spoils the finest genius.&nbsp; There is

not



<P>much danger that real talent or goodness will be overlooked long,



<P>even if it is, the consciousness of possessing and using it well



<P>should satisfy one, and the great charm of all power is modesty."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So it is!" cried Laurie, who was playing chess in a corner



<P>with Jo.&nbsp; "I knew a girl once, who had a really remarkable talent



<P>for music, and she didn't know it, never guessed what sweet little



<P>things she composed when she was alone, and wouldn't have believed



<P>it if anyone had told her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wish I'd known that nice girl.&nbsp; Maybe she would have helped



<P>me, I'm so stupid," said Beth, who stood beside him, listening



<P>eagerly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You do know her, and she helps you better than anyone else



<P>could," answered Laurie, looking at her with such mischievous



<P>meaning in his merry black eyes that Beth suddenly turned very



<P>red, and hid her face in the sofa cushion, quite overcome by such



<P>an unexpected discovery.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo let Laurie win the game to pay for that praise of her Beth,



<P>who could not be prevailed upon to play for them after her compliment.



<P>So Laurie did his best, and sang delightfully, being in a particularly



<P>lively humor, for to the Marches he seldom showed the moody side



<P>of his character.&nbsp; When he was gone, amy, who had been pensive



<P>all evening, said suddenly, as if busy over some new idea,



<P>"Is Laurie an accomplished boy?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, he has had an excellent education, and has much talent.



<P>He will make a fine man, if not spoiled by petting," replied her mother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And he isn't conceited, is he?" asked Amy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not in the least.&nbsp; That is why he is so charming and we all



<P>like him so much."



<P>"I see.&nbsp; It's nice to have accomplishments and be elegant, but



<P>not to show off or get perked up," said Amy thoughtfully.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"These things are always seen and felt in a person's manner



<P>and conversations, if modestly used, but it is not necessary to



<P>display them," said Mrs. March.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Any more than it's proper to wear all your bonnets and gowns



<P>and ribbons at once, that folks may know you've got them," added Jo,



<P>and the lecture ended in a laugh.

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The big house did prove a Palace Beautiful, though it took



<P>some time for all to get in, and Beth found it very hard to pass



<P>the lions.&nbsp; Old Mr. Laurence was the biggest one, but after he



<P>had called, said something funny or kind to each one of the girls,



<P>and talked over old times with their mother, nobody felt much



<P>afraid of him, except timid Beth.&nbsp; The other lion was the fact

that



<P>they were poor and Laurie rich, for this made them shy of accepting



<P>favors which they could not return.&nbsp; But, after a while, they found



<P>that he considered them the benefactors, and could not do enough to



<P>show how grateful he was for Mrs. March's motherly welcome, their



<P>cheerful society, and the comfort he took in that humble home of



<P>theirs.&nbsp; So they soon forgot their pride and interchanged kindnesses



<P>without stopping to think which was the greater.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>All sorts of pleasant things happened about that time, for the



<P>new friendship flourished like grass in spring.&nbsp; Every one liked



<P>Laurie, and he privately informed his tutor that "the Marches were



<P>regularly splendid girls."&nbsp; With the delightful enthusiasm of youth,



<P>they took the solitary boy into their midst and made much of him,



<P>and he found something very charming in the innocent companionship



<P>of these simple-hearted girls.&nbsp; Never having known mother or sisters,



<P>he was quick to feel the influences they brought about him, and



<P>their busy, lively ways made him ashamed of the indolent life he led.



<P>He was tired of books, and found people so interesting now that Mr.



<P>Brooke was obliged to make very unsatisfactory reports, for Laurie



<P>was always playing truant and running over to the Marches'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Never mind, let him take a holiday, and make it up afterward,"



<P>said the old gentleman.&nbsp; "The good lady next door says he is studying



<P>too hard and needs young society, amusement, and exercise.&nbsp; I suspect



<P>she is right, and that I've been coddling the fellow as if I'd been



<P>his grandmother.&nbsp; Let him do what he likes, as long as he is happy.



<P>He can't get into mischief in that little nunnery over there, and



<P>Mrs. March is doing more for him than we can."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>What good times they had, to be sure.&nbsp; Such plays and tableaux,



<P>such sleigh rides and skating frolics, such pleasant evenings in



<P>the old parlor, and now and then such gay little parties at the



<P>great house.&nbsp; Meg could walk in the conservatory whenever she liked



<P>and revel in bouquets, Jo browsed over the new library voraciously,



<P>and convulsed the old gentleman with her criticisms, Amy copied



<P>pictures and enjoyed beauty to her heart's content, and Laurie



<P>played `lord of the manor' in the most delightful style.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Beth, though yearning for the grand piano, could not



<P>pluck up courage to go to the `Mansion of Bliss', as Meg called



<P>it.&nbsp; She went once with Jo, but the old gentleman, not being



<P>aware of her infirmity, stared at her so hard from under his



<P>heavy eyebrows, and said "Hey!" so loud, that he frightened her



<P>so much her `feet chattered on the floor', she never told her



<P>mother, and she ran away, declaring she would never go there



<P>any more, not even for the dear piano.&nbsp; No persuasions or



<P>enticements could overcome her fear, till, the fact coming to



<P>Mr. Laurence's ear in some mysterious way, he set about mending



<P>matters.&nbsp; During one of the brief calls he made, he artfully



<P>led the conversation to music, and talked away about great



<P>singers whom he had seen, fine organs he had heard, and told



<P>such charming anecdotes that Beth found it impossible to stay



<P>in her distant corner, but crept nearer and nearer, as if



<P>fascinated.&nbsp; At the back of his chair she stopped and stood



<P>listening, with her great eyes wide open and her cheeks red



<P>with excitement of this unusual performance.&nbsp; Taking no more



<P>notice of her than if she had been a fly, Mr. Laurence talked on



<P>about Laurie's lessons and teachers.&nbsp; And presently, as if the



<P>idea had just occurred to him, he said to Mrs. March...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The boy neglects his music now, and I'm glad of it, for



<P>he was getting too fond of it.&nbsp; But the piano suffers for want



<P>of use.&nbsp; Wouldn't some of your girls like to run over, and



<P>practice on it now and then, just to keep it in tune, you know,



<P>ma`am?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Beth took a step forward, and pressed her hands tightly



<P>together to keep from clapping them, for this was an irresistible



<P>temptation, and the thought of practicing on that splendid



<P>instrument quite took her breath away.&nbsp; Before Mrs. March could



<P>reply, Mr. Laurence went on with an odd little nod and smile...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They needn't see or speak to anyone, but run in at any time.



<P>For I'm shut up in my study at the other end of the house, Laurie



<P>is out a great deal, and the servants are never near the drawing



<P>room after nine o'clock."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here he rose, as if going, and Beth made up her mind to speak,



<P>for that last arrangement left nothing to be desired.&nbsp; "Please,

tell



<P>the young ladies what I say, and if they don't care to come, why,



<P>never mind."&nbsp; Here a little hand slipped into his, and Beth looked



<P>up at him with a face full of gratitude, as she said, in her earnest



<P>yet timid way...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh sir, they do care, very very much!"



<P>"Are you the musical girl?" he asked, without any startling



<P>"Hey!" as he looked down at her very kindly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm Beth.&nbsp; I love it dearly, and I'll come, if you are quite



<P>sure nobody will hear me, and be disturbed," she added, fearing to



<P>be rude, and trembling at her own boldness as she spoke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not a soul, my dear.&nbsp; The house is empty half the day, so



<P>come and drum away as much as you like, and I shall be obliged to



<P>you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How kind you are, sir!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Beth blushed like a rose under the friendly look he wore, but she



<P>was not frightened now, and gave the hand a grateful squeeze because



<P>she had no words to thank him for the precious gift he had given her.



<P>The old gentleman softly stroked the hair off her forehead, and,



<P>stooping down, he kissed herr, saying, in a tone few people ever heard...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I had a little girl once, with eyes like these.&nbsp; God bless you,



<P>my dear!&nbsp; Good day.&nbsp; madam."&nbsp; And away he went, in a

great hurry.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Beth had a rapture with her mother, and then rushed up to



<P>impart the glorious news to her family of invalids, as the girls



<P>were not home.&nbsp; How blithely she sang that evening, and how they



<P>all laughed at her because she woke Amy in the night by playing



<P>the piano on her face in her sleep.&nbsp; Next day, having seen both



<P>the old and young gentleman out of the house, Beth, after two or



<P>three retreats, fairly got in at the side door, and made her way



<P>as noiselessly as any mouse to the drawing room where her idol



<P>stood.&nbsp; Quite by accident, of course, some pretty, easy music lay



<P>on the piano, and with trembling fingers and frequent stops to



<P>listen and look about, Beth at last touched the great instrument,



<P>and straightway forgot her fear, herself, and everything else but



<P>the unspeakable delight which the music gave her, for it was like



<P>the voice of a beloved friend.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She stayed till Hannah came to take her home to dinner, but she



<P>had no appetite, and could only sit and smile upon everyone in a general



<P>state of beatitude.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After that, the little brown hood slipped through the hedge



<P>nearly every day, and the great drawing room was haunted by a tuneful



<P>spirit that came and went unseen.&nbsp; She never knew that Mr. Laurence



<P>opened his study door to hear the old-fashioned airs he liked.&nbsp;

She



<P>never saw Laurie mount guard in the hall to warn the servants away.



<P>She never suspected that the exercise books and new songs which she



<P>found in the rack were put there for her especial benefit, and when



<P>he talked to her about music at home, she only thought how kind he



<P>was to tell things that helped her so much.&nbsp; So she enjoyed herself



<P>heartily, and found, what isn't always the case, that her granted



<P>wish was all she had hoped.&nbsp; Perhaps it was because she was so

grateful



<P>for this blessing that a greater was given her.&nbsp; At any rate she



<P>deserved both.



<P>"Mother, I'm going to work Mr. Laurence a pair of slippers.&nbsp; He



<P>is so kind to me, I must thank him, and I don't know any other way.



<P>Can I do it?" asked Beth, a few weeks after that eventful call of his.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, dear.&nbsp; It will please him very much, and be a nice way of



<P>thanking him.&nbsp; The girls will help you about them, and I will pay

for



<P>the making up," replied Mrs. March, who took peculiar pleasure in



<P>granting Beth's requests because she so seldom asked anything for



<P>herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After many serious discussions with Meg and Jo, the pattern was



<P>chosen, the materials bought, and the slippers begun.&nbsp; A cluster

of



<P>grave yet cheerful pansies on a deeper purple ground was pronounced



<P>very appropriate and pretty, and beth worked away early and late, with



<P>occasional lifts over hard parts.&nbsp; She was a nimble little needlewoman,



<P>and they were finished before anyone got tired of them.&nbsp; Then she

wrote



<P>a short, simple note, and with Laurie's help, got them smuggled onto



<P>the study table one morning before the old gentleman was up.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When this excitement was over, Beth waited to see what would



<P>happen.&nbsp; All day passed a a part of the next before any



<P>acknowledgement arrived, and she was beginning to fear she had offended



<P>her crochety friend.&nbsp; On the afternoon of the second day, she went

out



<P>to do an errand, and give poor Joanna, the invalid doll, her daily



<P>exercise.&nbsp; As she came up the street, on her return, she saw three,



<P>yes, four heads popping in and out of the parlor windows, and the



<P>moment they saw her, several hands were waved, and several joyful



<P>voices screamed...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here's a letter from the old gentleman!&nbsp; Come quick, and read

it!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, Beth, he's sent you..." began Amy, gesticulating with



<P>unseemly energy, but she got no further, for Jo quenched her by



<P>slamming down the window.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense.&nbsp; At the door her



<P>sisters seized and bore her to the parlor in a triumphal procession,



<P>all pointing and all saying at once, "Look there!&nbsp; Look there!"&nbsp;

Beth



<P>did look, and turned pale with delight and surprise, for there stood



<P>a little cabinet piano, with a letter lying on the glossy lid, directed



<P>like a sign board to "Miss Elizabeth March."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"For me?" gasped Beth, holding onto Jo and feeling as if she



<P>should tumble down, it was such an overwhelming thing altogether.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, all for you, my precious!&nbsp; Isn't it splendid of him?&nbsp;

Don't



<P>you think he's the dearest old man in the world?&nbsp; Here's the key

in



<P>the letter.&nbsp; We didn't open it, but we are dying to know what he

says,"



<P>cried Jo, hugging her sister and offering the note.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You read it!&nbsp; I can't, I feel so queer!&nbsp; Oh, it is too lovely!"



<P>and Beth hid her face in Jo's apron, quite upset by her present.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo opened the paper and began to laugh, for the first worked she



<P>saw were...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Miss March:



<P>"Dear Madam--"



<P>"How nice it sounds!&nbsp; I wish someone would write to me so!" said



<P>Amy, who thought the old-fashioned address very elegant.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"`I have had many pairs of slippers in my life, but I never had



<P>any that suited me so well as yours, '" continues Jo.&nbsp; "`Heartsease

is



<P>my favorite flower, and these will always remind me of the gentle



<P>giver.&nbsp; I like to pay my debts, so I know you will allow `the old



<P>gentleman' to send you something which once belonged to the little



<P>grand daughter he lost.&nbsp; With hearty thanks and best wishes, I

remain



<P>"`Your grateful friend and humble servant,



<P>"`JAMES LAURENCE'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There, Beth, that's an honor to be proud of, I'm sure! Laurie



<P>told me how fond Mr.Laurence used to be of the child who died, and



<P>how he kept all her little things carefully.&nbsp; Just think, he's

given



<P>you her piano.&nbsp; That comes of having big blue eyes and loving music,"



<P>said Jo, trying to soothe Beth, who trembled and looked more excited



<P>than she had ever been before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"See the cunning brackets to hold candles, and the nice green



<P>sild, puckered up, with a gold rose in the middle, and the pretty



<P>rack and stool, all complete," added Meg, opening the instrument



<P>and displaying its beauties.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"`Your humble servant, James Laurence'.&nbsp; Only think of his



<P>writing that to you.&nbsp; I'll tell the girls.&nbsp; They'll think

it's



<P>splendid," said Amy, much impressed by the note.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Try it, honey.&nbsp; Let's hear the sound of the baby pianny,"



<P>said Hannah, who always took a share in the family joys and sorrows.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So Beth tried it, and everyone pronounced it the most remarkable



<P>piano ever heard.&nbsp; It had evidently been newly tuned and put in

apple-



<P>pie order, but, perfect as it was, I think the real charm lay in the



<P>happiest of all happy faces which leaned over it, as Beth lovingly



<P>touched the beautiful black and white keys and pressed the bright pedals.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You'll have to go and thank him," said Jo, by way of a joke,



<P>for the idea of the child's really going never entered her head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, I mean to.&nbsp; I guess I'll go no, before I get frightened



<P>thinking about it." And, to the utter amazement of the assembled



<P>family, Beth walked deliberately down the garden, through the



<P>hedge, and in at the Laurences' door.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I wish I may die if it ain't the queerest thing I ever



<P>see!&nbsp; The pianny has turned her head!&nbsp; She'd never have gone

in



<P>her right mind," cried Hannah, staring after her, while the girls



<P>were rendered quite speechless by the miracle.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They would have been still more amazed if they had seen what



<P>Beth did afterward.&nbsp; If you will believe me, she went and knocked



<P>at the study door before she gave herself time to think, and when



<P>a gruff voice called out, "come in!" she did go in, right up to



<P>Mr. Laurence, who looked quite taken aback, and held out her hand,



<P>saying, with only a small quaver in her voice, "I came to thank you,



<P>sir, for..." But she didn't finish, for he looked so friendly that



<P>she forgot her speech and, only remembering that he had lost the



<P>little girl he loved, she put both arms round his neck and kissed



<P>him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If the roof of the house had suddenly flown off, the old



<P>gentleman wouldn't have been more astonished.&nbsp; But he liked it.



<P>Oh, dear, yes, he liked it amazingly!&nbsp; And was so touched and



<P>pleased by that confiding little kiss that all his crustiness



<P>vanished, and he just set her on his knee, and laid his



<P>wrinkled cheek against her rosy one, feeling as if he had got his



<P>own little grand daughter back again.&nbsp; Beth ceased to fear him



<P>from that moment, and sat there talking to him as cozily as if



<P>she had known him all her life, for love casts out fear, and



<P>gratitude can conquer pride.&nbsp; When she went home, he walked with



<P>her to her own gate, shook hands cordially, and touched his hat



<P>as he marched back again, looking very stately and erect, like



<P>a handsome, soldierly old gentleman, as he was.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the girls saw that performance, Jo began to dance a jig,



<P>by way of expressing her satisfaction, Amy nearly fell out of the



<P>window in her surprise, and Meg exclaimed, with up-lifted hands,



<P>"Well, I do believe the world is coming to an end.

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Beth was postmistress, for, being most at home, she could



<P>attend to it regularly, and dearly liked the daily task of



<P>unlocking the little door and distributing the mail.&nbsp; One July



<P>day she came in with her hands full, and went about the house



<P>leaving letters and parcels like the penny post.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here's your posy, Mother!&nbsp; Laurie never forgets that," she



<P>said, putting the fresh nosegay in the vase that stood in `Marmee's



<P>corner', and was kept supplied by the affectionate boy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Miss Meg March, one letter and a glove," continued Beth,



<P>delivering the articles to her sister, who sat near her mother,



<P>stitching wristbands.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, I left a pair over there, and here is only one," said



<P>Meg, looking at the gray cotton glove.&nbsp; "Didn't you drop the



<P>other in the garden?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I'm sure I didn't, for there was only one in the office."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hate to have odd gloves!&nbsp; Never mind, the other may be



<P>found.&nbsp; My letter is only a translation of the German song I



<P>wanted.&nbsp; I think Mr. Brooke did it, for this isn't Laurie's



<P>writing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. March glanced at Meg, who was looking very pretty in



<P>her gingham morning gown, with the little curls blowing about her



<P>forehead, and very womanly, as she sat sewing at her little worktable,



<P>full of tidy white rolls, so unconscious of the thought in her



<P>mother's mind as she sewed and sang, while her fingers flew



<P>and her thoughts were busied with girlish fancies as innocent



<P>and fresh as the pansies in her belt, that Mrs. March smiled and



<P>was satisfied.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Two letters for Doctor Jo, a book, and a funny old hat,



<P>which covered the whole post office and stuck outside," said



<P>Beth, laughing as she went into the study where Jo sat writing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What a sly fellow Laurie is!&nbsp; I said I wished bigger hats



<P>were the fashion, because I burn my face every hot day.&nbsp; He said,



<P>`Why mind the fashion?&nbsp; Wear a big hat, and be comfortable!' I



<P>said I would if I had one, and he has sent me this to try me.&nbsp;

I'll



<P>wear it for fun, and show him I don't care for the fashion."&nbsp; And



<P>hanging the antique broadbrim on a bust of Plato, Jo read her



<P>letters.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill,



<P>for it said to her...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>My Dear:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I write a little word to tell you with how much satisfaction



<P>I watch your efforts to control your temper.&nbsp; You say nothing



<P>about your trials, failures, or successes, and think, perhaps,



<P>that no one sees them but the Friend whose help you daily ask,



<P>if I may trust the well-worn cover of your guidebook.&nbsp; I, too,



<P>have seen them all, and heartily believe in the sincerity of



<P>your resolution, since it begins to bear fruit.&nbsp; Go on, dear,



<P>patiently and bravely, and always believe that no one sympathizes



<P>more tenderly with you than your loving...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mother

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That does me good!&nbsp; That's worth millions of money and



<P>pecks of praise.&nbsp; Oh, Marmee, I do try!&nbsp; I will keep on trying,



<P>and not get tired, since I have you to help me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laying her head on her arms, Jo wet her little romance with



<P>a few happy tears.&nbsp; for she had thought that no one saw and



<P>appreciated her efforts to be good, and this assurance was doubly



<P>precious, doubly encouraging, because unexpected and from the



<P>person whose commendation she most valued.&nbsp; Feeling stronger than



<P>ever to meet and subdue her Apollyon, she pinned the note inside her



<P>frock, as a shield and a reminder, lest she be taken unaware, and



<P>proceeded to open her other letter, quite ready for either good or



<P>bad news.&nbsp; In a big, dashing hand, Laurie wrote...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Dear Jo,



<P>What ho!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Some english girls and boys are coming to see me tomorrow



<P>and I want to have a jolly time.&nbsp; If it's fine, I'm going to pitch



<P>my tent in Longmeadow, and row up the whole crew to lunch and



<P>croquet--have a fire, make messes, gypsy fashion, and all sorts



<P>of larks.&nbsp; They are nice people, and like such things.&nbsp; Brooke

will



<P>go to keep us boys steady, and Kate Vaughn will play propriety for



<P>the girls.&nbsp; I want you all to come, can't let Beth off at any price,



<P>and nobody shall worry her.&nbsp; Don't bother about rations, I'll see



<P>to that and everything else, only do come, there's a good fellow!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In a tearing hurry,



<P>Yours ever, Laurie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here's richness!" cried Jo, flying in to tell the news to Meg.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Of course we can go, Mother?&nbsp; It will be such a help to



<P>Laurie, for I can row, and Meg see to the lunch, and the children



<P>be useful in some way."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hope the Vaughns are not fine grown-up people.&nbsp; Do you



<P>know anything about them, Jo?" asked Meg.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Only that there are four of them.&nbsp; Kate is older than you,



<P>Fred and Frank (twins) about my age, and a little girl (Grace), who



<P>is nine or ten.&nbsp; Laurie knew them abroad, and liked the boys.&nbsp;

I



<P>fancied, from the way he primmed up his mouth in speaking of her,



<P>that he didn't admire Kate much."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm so glad my French print is clean, it's just the thing



<P>and so becoming!" observed Meg complacently.&nbsp; "Have you anything



<P>decent, Jo?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Scarlet and gray boating suit, good enough for me.&nbsp; I shall



<P>row and tramp about, so I don't want any starch to think of.&nbsp; You'll



<P>come, Betty?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If you won't let any boys talk to me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not a boy!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I like to please Laurie, and I'm not afraid of Mr. Brooke,



<P>he is so kind.&nbsp; But I don't want to play, or sing, or say anything.



<P>I'll work hard and not trouble anyone, and you'll take care of me,



<P>Jo, so I'll go."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's my good girl.&nbsp; You do try to fight off your shyness,



<P>and I love you for it.&nbsp; Fighting faults isn't easy, as I know,

and



<P>a cheery word kind of gives a lift.&nbsp; Thank you, Mother," And Jo



<P>gave the thin cheek a grateful kiss, more precious to Mrs. March



<P>than if it had given back the rosy roundness of her youth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I had a box of chocolate drops, and the picture I wanted to



<P>copy," said Amy, showing her mail.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And I got a note from Mr. Laurence, asking me to come over



<P>and play to him tonight, before the lamps are lighted, and I shall



<P>go," added Beth, whose friendship with the old gentleman prospered



<P>finely.



<P>"Now let's fly round, and do double duty today, so that we can



<P>play tomorrow with free minds," said Jo, preparing to replace her



<P>pen with a broom.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the sun peeped into the girls' room early next morning



<P>to promise them a fine day, he saw a comical sight.&nbsp; Each had



<P>made such preparation for the fete as seemed necessary and proper.



<P>Meg had an extra row of little curlpapers across her forehead, Jo



<P>had copiously anointed her afflicted face with cold cream, Beth



<P>had taken Joanna to bed with her to atone for the approaching



<P>separation, and Amy had capped the climax by putting a colthespin



<P>on her nose to uplift the offending feature.&nbsp; It was one of the



<P>kind artists use to hold the paper on their drawing boards,



<P>therefore quite appropriate and effective for the purpose it was now



<P>being put.&nbsp; This funny spectacle appeared to amuse the sun, for



<P>he burst out with such radiance that Jo woke up and roused her



<P>sisters by a hearty laugh at Amy's ornament.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sunshine and laughter were good omens for a pleasure party,



<P>and soon a lively bustle began in both houses.&nbsp; Beth, who was



<P>ready first, kept reporting what went on next door, and enlivened



<P>her sisters' toilets by frequent telegrams from the window.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There goes the man with the tent!&nbsp; I see Mrs. Barker doing



<P>up the lunch in a hamper and a great basket.&nbsp; Now Mr. Laurence

is



<P>looking up at the sky and the weathercock.&nbsp; I wish he would go



<P>too.&nbsp; There's Laurie, looking like a sailor, nice boy!&nbsp; Oh,

mercy



<P>me!&nbsp; Here's a carriage full of people, a tall lady, a little girl,



<P>and two dreadful boys.&nbsp; One is lame, poor thing, he's got a crutch.



<P>Laurie didn't tell us that.&nbsp; Be quick, girls!&nbsp; It's getting

late.



<P>Why, there is Ned Moffat, I do declare.&nbsp; Meg, isn't that the man



<P>who bowed to you one day when we were shopping?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So it is.&nbsp; How queer that he should come.&nbsp; I thought he was



<P>at the mountains.&nbsp; There is Sallie.&nbsp; I'm glad she got back

in time.



<P>Am I all right, Jo?" cried Meg in a flutter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A regular daisy.&nbsp; Hold up your dress and put your hat on



<P>straight, it looks sentimental tipped that way and will fly off



<P>at the first puff.&nbsp; Now then, come on!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, Jo, you are not going to wear that awful hat?&nbsp; It's too



<P>absurd!&nbsp; You shall not make a guy of yourself," remonstrated Meg,



<P>as Jo tied down with a red ribbon the broad-brimmed, old-fashioned



<P>leghorn Laurie had sent for a joke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I just will, though, for it's capital, so shady, light, and big.



<P>It will make fun, and I don't mind being a guy if I'm comfortable."



<P>With that Jo marched straight away and the rest followed,



<P>a bright little band of sisters, all looking their best in summer



<P>suits, with happy faces under the jaunty hatbrims.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie ran to meet and present them to his friends in the



<P>most cordial manner.&nbsp; The lawn was the reception room, and for



<P>several minutes a lively scene was enacted there.&nbsp; Meg was



<P>grateful to see that Miss Kate, though twenty, was dressed with



<P>a simplicity which American girls would do well to imitate, and



<P>who was much flattered by Mr. Ned's assurances that he came



<P>especially to see her.&nbsp; Jo understood why Laurie `primmed up



<P>his mouth' when speaking of Kate, for that young lady had a



<P>standoff-don't-touch-me air, which contrasted strongly with the



<P>free and easy demeanor of the other girls.&nbsp; Beth took an observation



<P>of the new boys and decided that the lame one was not `dreadful',



<P>but gentle and feeble, and she would be kind to him on that



<P>account.&nbsp; Amy found Grace a well-mannered, merry, little person,



<P>and after staring dumbly at one another for a few minutes, they



<P>suddenly became very good friends.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Tents, lunch, and croquet utensils having been sent on



<P>beforehand, the party was soon embarked, and the two boats



<P>pushed off together, leaving Mr. Laurence waving his hat on the



<P>shore.&nbsp; Laurie and Jo rowed one boat, Mr. Brooke and Ned the



<P>other, while Fred Vaughn, the riotous twin, did his best to



<P>upset both by paddling about in a wherry like a disturbed water



<P>bug.&nbsp; Jo's funny hat deserved a vote of thanks, for it was of



<P>general utility.&nbsp; It broke the ice in the beginning by producing



<P>a laugh, it created quite a refreshing breeze, flapping to and



<P>fro as she rowed, and would make an excellent umbrella for the



<P>whole party, if a shower came up, she said.&nbsp; Miss Kate decided



<P>that she was `odd', but rather clever, and smiled upon her from



<P>afar.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg, in the other boat, was delightfully situated, face to



<P>face with the rowers, who both admired the prospect and feathered



<P>their oars with uncommon `skill and dexterity'.&nbsp; Mr. Brooke was



<P>a grave, silent young man, with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant



<P>voice.&nbsp; Meg liked his quiet manners and considered him a walking



<P>encyclopedia of useful knowledge.&nbsp; He never talked to her much,

but



<P>he looked at her a good deal, and she felt sure that he did not



<P>regard her with aversion.&nbsp; Ned, being in college, of course put



<P>on all the airs which freshmen think it their bounden duty to



<P>assume.&nbsp; He was not very wise, but very good-natured, and altogether



<P>an excellent person to carry on a picnic.&nbsp; Sallie Gardiner was



<P>absorbed in keeping her white pique dress clean and chattering with



<P>the ubiquitous Fred, who kept Beth in constant terror by his pranks.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was not far to Longmeadow, but the tent was pitched and



<P>the wickets down by the time they arrived.&nbsp; A pleasant green field,



<P>with three wide-spreading oaks in the middle and a smooth strip of



<P>turf for croquet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Welcome to Camp Laurence!" said the young host, as they



<P>landed with exclamations of delight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Brooke is commander in chief, I am commissary general, the



<P>other fellows are staff officers, and you, ladies, are company.



<P>The tent is for your especial benefit and that oak is your drawing



<P>room, this is the messroom and the third is the camp kitchen.&nbsp;

Now,



<P>let's have a game before it gets hot, and then we'll see about



<P>dinner."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Frank, Beth, Amy, and Grace sat down to watch the game



<P>played by the other eight.&nbsp; Mr. Brooke chose Meg, Kate, and Fred.



<P>Laurie took Sallie, Jo, and Ned.&nbsp; The English played well, but



<P>the Americans played better, and contested every inch of the



<P>ground as strongly as if the spirit of `76 inspired them.&nbsp; Jo and



<P>Fred had several skirmishes and once narrowly escaped high words.



<P>Jo was through the last wicket and had missed the stroke, which



<P>failure ruffled her a good deal.&nbsp; Fred was close behind her and



<P>his turn came before hers.&nbsp; He gave a stroke, his ball hit the



<P>wicket, and stopped an inch on the wrong side.&nbsp; No one was very



<P>near, and running up to examine, he gave it a sly nudge with his



<P>toe, which put it just an inch on the right side.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm through!&nbsp; Now, Miss Jo, I'll settle you, and get in



<P>first," cried the young gentleman, swinging his mallet for another



<P>blow.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You pushed it.&nbsp; I saw you.&nbsp; It's my turn now," said Jo



<P>sharply.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Upon my word, I didn't move it.&nbsp; It rolled a bit, perhaps,



<P>but that is allowed.&nbsp; So, stand off please, and let me have a go



<P>at the stake."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We don't cheat in America, but you can, if you choose," said



<P>Jo angrily.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yankees are a deal the most tricky, everybody knows.&nbsp; There



<P>you go!" returned Fred, croqueting her ball far away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo opened her lips to say something rude, but checked herself



<P>in time, colored up to her forehead and stood a minute, hammering



<P>down a wicket with all her might, while Fred hit the stake and



<P>declared himself out with much exultation.&nbsp; She went off to get

her



<P>ball, and was a long time finding it among the bushes, but she came



<P>back, looking cool and quiet, and waited her turn patiently.&nbsp; It



<P>took several strokes to regain the place she had lost, and when she



<P>got there, the other side had nearly won, for Kate's ball was the



<P>last but one and lay near the stake.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"By George, it's all up with us!&nbsp; Goodbye, Kate.&nbsp; Miss Jo



<P>owes me one, so you are finished," cried Fred excitedly, as they



<P>all drew near to see the finish.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yankees have a trick of being generous to their enemies,"



<P>said Jo, with a look that made the lad redden, "especially when



<P>they beat them," she added, as, leaving Kate's ball untouched, she



<P>won the game by a clever stroke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie threw up his hat, then remembered that it wouldn't do



<P>to exult over the defeat of his guests, and stopped in the middle



<P>of the cheer to whisper to his friend, "Good for you, Jo!&nbsp; He did



<P>cheat, I saw him.&nbsp; We can't tell him so, but he won't do it again,



<P>take my word for it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg drew her aside, under pretense of pinning up a loose



<P>braid, and said approvingly, "It was dreadfully provoking, but you



<P>kept your temper, and I'm so glad, Jo."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't praise me, Meg, for I could box his ears this minute.



<P>I should certainly have boiled over if I hadn't stayed among the



<P>nettles till I got my rage under control enough to hold my tongue..



<P>It's simmering now, so I hope he'll keep out of my way," returned



<P>Jo, biting her lips as she glowered at Fred from under her big hat.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Time for lunch," said Mr. Brooke, looking at his watch.



<P>"Commissary general, will you make the fire and get water, while



<P>Miss March, Miss Sallie, and I spread the table?&nbsp; Who can make

good



<P>coffee?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Jo can," said Meg, glad to recommend her sister.&nbsp; So Jo,



<P>feeling that her late lessons in cookery were to do her honor, went



<P>to preside over the coffeepot, while the children collected dry



<P>sticks, and the boys made a fire and got water from a spring near



<P>by.&nbsp; Miss Kate sketched and Frank talked to Beth, who was making



<P>little mats of braided rushes to serve as plates.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The commander in chief and his aides soon spread the



<P>tablecloth with an inviting array of eatables and drinkables,



<P>prettily decorated with green leaves.&nbsp; Jo announced that the coffee



<P>was ready, and everyone settled themselves to a hearty meal, for youth



<P>is seldom dyspeptic, and exercise develops wholesome appetites.



<P>A very merry lunch it was, for everything seemed fresh and funny, and



<P>frequent peals of laughter startled a venerable horse who fed near



<P>by.&nbsp; There was a pleasing inequality in the table, which produced



<P>many mishaps to cups and plates, acorns dropped in the milk, little



<P>black ants partook of the refreshments without being invited, and



<P>fuzzy caterpillars swung down from the tree to see what was going



<P>on.&nbsp; Three white-headed children peeped over the fence, and an



<P>objectionable dog barked at them from the other side of the river



<P>with all his might and main.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There's salt here," said Laurie, as he handed Jo a saucer



<P>of berries.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you, I prefer spiders," she replied, fishing up two



<P>unwary little ones who had gone to a creamy death.&nbsp; "How dare



<P>you remind me of that horrid dinner party, when your's is so



<P>nice in every way?' added Jo, as they both laughed and ate out



<P>of one plate, the china having run short.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I had an uncommonly good time that day, and haven't got



<P>over it yet.&nbsp; This is no credit to me, you know, I don't do



<P>anything.&nbsp; It's you and Meg and Brooke who make it all go, and



<P>I'm no end obliged to you.&nbsp; what shall we do when we can't eat



<P>anymore?" asked Laurie, feeling that his trump card had been



<P>played when lunch was over.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Have games till it's cooler.&nbsp; I brought Authors, and I dare



<P>say Miss Kate knows something new and nice.&nbsp; Go and ask her.&nbsp;

She's



<P>company, and you ought to stay with her more."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Aren't you company too?&nbsp; I thought she'd suit Brooke, but



<P>he keeps talking to Meg, and Kate just stares at them through that



<P>ridiculous glass of hers'.&nbsp; I'm going, so you needn't try to preach



<P>propriety, for you can't do it, Jo."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Kate did know several new games, and as the girls would



<P>not, and the boys could not, eat any more, they all adjourned to



<P>the drawing room to play Rig-marole.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"One person begins a story, any nonsense you like, and tells



<P>as long as he pleases, only taking care to stop short at some



<P>exciting point, when the next takes it up and does the same.&nbsp; It's



<P>very funny when well done, and makes a perfect jumble of tragical



<P>comical stuff to laugh over.&nbsp; Please start it, Mr. Brooke," said



<P>Kate, with a commanding air, which surprised Meg, who treated the



<P>tutor with as much respect as any other gentleman.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lying on the grass at the feet of the two young ladies, Mr.



<P>Brooke obediently began the story, with the handsome brown eyes



<P>steadily fixed upon the sunshiny river.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Once on a time, a knight went out into the world to seek



<P>his fortune, for he had nothing but his sword and his shield.



<P>He traveled a long while, nearly eight-and-twenty years, and



<P>had a hard time of it, till he came to the palace of a good old



<P>king, who had offered a reward to anyone who could tame and train



<P>a fine but unbroken colt, of which he was very fond.&nbsp; The knight



<P>agreed to try, and got on slowly but surely, for the colt was a



<P>gallant fellow, and soon learned to love his new master, though



<P>he was freakish and wild.&nbsp; Every day, when he gave his lessons

to



<P>this pet of the king's, the knight rode him through the city, and



<P>as he rode, he looked everywhere for a certain beautiful face,



<P>which he had seen many times in his dreams, but never found.&nbsp; One



<P>day, as he went prancing down a quiet street, he saw at the window



<P>of a ruinous castle the lovely face.&nbsp; He was delighted, inquired



<P>who lived in this old castle, and was told that several captive



<P>princesses were kept there by a spell, and spun all day to lay



<P>up money to buy their liberty.&nbsp; The knight wished intensely that



<P>he could free them, but he was poor and could only go by each



<P>day, watching for the sweet face and longing to see it out in



<P>the sunshine.&nbsp; At last he resolved to get into the castle and



<P>ask how he could help them.&nbsp; He went and knocked.&nbsp; The great



<P>door flew open, and he beheld .&nbsp; .."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A ravishingly lovely lady, who exclaimed, with a cry of



<P>rapture, `At last!&nbsp; At last!'" continued Kate, who had read



<P>French novels, and admired the style.&nbsp; "`Tis she!' cried Count



<P>Gustave, and fell at her feet in an ecstasy of joy.&nbsp; `Oh, rise!'



<P>she said, extending a hand of marble fairness.&nbsp; `Never! Till you



<P>tell me how I may rescue you, ' swore the knight, still kneeling.



<P>`Alas, my cruel fate condemns me to remain here till my tyrant



<P>is destroyed.' `Where is the villain?' `In the mauve salon.&nbsp; Go,



<P>brave heart, and save me from despair.' `I obey, and return



<P>victorious or dead!' With these thrilling words he rushed away,



<P>and flinging open the door of the mauve salon, was about to enter,



<P>when he received..."



<P>"A stunning blow from the big Greek lexicon, which an old



<P>fellow in a black gown fired at him," said Ned.&nbsp; "Instantly, Sir



<P>What's-his-name recovered himself, pitched the tyrant out of the



<P>window, and turned to join the lady, victorious, but with a bump



<P>on his brow, found the door locked, tore up the curtains, made a



<P>rope ladder, got halfway down when the ladder broke, and he went



<P>headfirst into the moat, sixty feet below.&nbsp; Could swim like a



<P>duck, paddled round the castle till he came to a little door



<P>guarded by two stout fellows, knocked their heads together till



<P>they cracked like a couple of nuts, then, by a trifling exertion



<P>of his prodigious strength, he smashed in the door, went up a



<P>pair of stone steps covered with dust a foot thick, toads as big



<P>as your fist, and spiders that would frighten you into hysterics,



<P>MIss March.&nbsp; At the top of these steps he came plump upon a sight



<P>that took his breath away and chilled his blood..."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A tall figure, all in white with a veil over its face and a



<P>lamp in its wasted hand," went on Meg.&nbsp; "It beckoned, gliding



<P>noiselessly before him down a corridor as dark and cold as any



<P>tomb.&nbsp; Shadowy effigies in armor stood on either side, a dead



<P>silence reigned, the lamp burned blue, and the ghostly figure ever



<P>and anon turned its face toward him, showing the glitter of awful



<P>eyes through its white veil.&nbsp; They reached a curtained door, behind



<P>which sounded lovely music.&nbsp; He sprang forward to enter, but the



<P>specter plucked him back, and waved threateningly before him a..."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Snuffbox," said Jo, in a sepulchral tone, which convulsed the



<P>audience.&nbsp; "`Thankee, ' said the knight politely, as he took a

pinch



<P>and sneezed seven times so violently that his head fell off.&nbsp; `Ha!



<P>Ha!' laughed the ghost, and having peeped through the keyhole at the



<P>princesses spinning away for dear life, the evil spirit picked up



<P>her victim and put him in a large tin box, where there were eleven



<P>other knights packed together without their heads, like sardines,



<P>who all rose and began to..."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dance a hornpipe," cut in Fred, as Jo paused for breath, "and,



<P>as they danced, the rubbishy old castle turned to a man-of-war in



<P>full sail.&nbsp; `Up with the jib, reef the tops'l halliards, helm hard



<P>alee, and man the guns!' roared the captain, as a Portuguese pirate



<P>hove in sight, with a flag black as ink flying from her foremast.



<P>`Go in and win, my hearties!' says the captain, and a tremendous



<P>fight began.&nbsp; Of course the British beat, they always do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, they don't!" cried Jo, aside.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Having taken the pirate captain prisoner, sailed slap over



<P>the schooner, whose decks were piled high with dead and whose



<P>lee scuppers ran blood, for the order had been `Cutlasses, and



<P>die hard!' `Bosun's mate, take a bight of the flying-jib sheet,



<P>and start this villain if he doesn't confess his sins double



<P>quick, ' said the British captain.&nbsp; The Portuguese held his tongue



<P>like a brick, and walked the plank, while the jolly tars cheered



<P>like mad.&nbsp; But the sly dog dived, came up under the man-of-war,



<P>scuttled her, and down she went, with all sail set, `To the



<P>bottom of the sea, sea, sea' where..."



<P>"Oh, gracious!&nbsp; What shall I say?" cried Sallie, as Fred



<P>ended his rigmarole, in which he had jumbled together pell-mell



<P>nautical phrases and facts out of one of his favorite books.



<P>"Well, they went to the bottom, and a nice mermaid welcomed them,



<P>but was much grieved on finding the box of headless knights, and



<P>kindly pickled them in brine, hoping to discover the mystery



<P>about them, for being a woman, she was curious.&nbsp; By-and-by a diver



<P>came down, and the mermaid said, `I'll give you a box of pearls



<P>if you can take it up, ' for she wanted to restore the poor things



<P>to life, and couldn't raise the heavy load herself.&nbsp; So the diver



<P>hoisted it up, and was much disappointed on opening it to find



<P>no pearls.&nbsp; He left it in a great lonely field, where it was



<P>found by a..."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Little goose girl, who kept a hundred fat geese in the field,"



<P>said Amy, when Sallie's invention gave out.&nbsp; "The little girl was



<P>sorry for them, and asked an old woman what she should do to help



<P>them.&nbsp; `Your geese will tell you, they know everything.' said the



<P>old woman.&nbsp; So she asked what she should use for new heads, since



<P>the old ones were lost, and all the geese opened their hundred



<P>mouths and screamed..."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"`Cabbages!'" continued Laurie promptly.&nbsp; "`Just the thing, '



<P>said the girl, and ran to get twelve fine ones from her garden.



<P>She put them on, the knights revived at once, thanked her, and



<P>went on their way rejoicing, never knowing the difference, for



<P>there were so many other heads like them in the world that no one



<P>thought anything of it.&nbsp; The knight in whom I'm interest went back



<P>to find the pretty face, and learned that the princesses had spun



<P>themselves free and all gone and married, but one.&nbsp; He was in a



<P>great state of mind at that, and mounting the colt, who stood by



<P>him through thick and thin, rushed to the castle to see which was



<P>left.&nbsp; Peeping over the hedge, he saw the queen of his affections



<P>picking flowers in her garden.&nbsp; `Will you give me a rose?' said



<P>he.&nbsp; `You must come and get it.&nbsp; I can't come to you, it isn't



<P>proper, ' said she, as sweet as honey.&nbsp; He tried to climb over



<P>the hedge, but it seemed to grow higher and higher.&nbsp; Then he



<P>tried to push through, but it grew thicker and thicker, and he



<P>was in despair.&nbsp; So he patiently broke twig after twig till he



<P>had made a little hole through which he peeped, saying imploringly,



<P>`Let me in!&nbsp; Let me in!' But the pretty princess did not seem



<P>to understand, for she picked her roses quietly, and left him



<P>to fight his way in.&nbsp; Whether he did or not, Frank will tell you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I can't.&nbsp; I'm not playing, I never do," said Frank, dismayed



<P>at the sentimental predicament out of which he was to rescue the



<P>absurd couple.&nbsp; Beth had disappeared behind Jo, and Grace was



<P>asleep.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So the poor knight is to be left sticking in the hedge, is



<P>he?" asked Mr. Brooke, still watching the river, and playing



<P>with the wild rose in his buttonhole.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I guess the princess gave him a posy, and opened the gate



<P>after a while," said Laurie, smiling to himself, as he threw



<P>acorns at his tutor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What a piece of nonsense we have made!&nbsp; With practice we



<P>might do something quite clever.&nbsp; Do you know Truth?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hope so," said Meg soberly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The game, I mean?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"what is it?" said Fred.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, you pile up your hands, choose a number, and draw out



<P>in turn, and the person who draws at the number has to answer



<P>truly any question put by the rest.&nbsp; It's great fun."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Let's try it," said Jo, who liked new experiments.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Kate and Mr. Booke, Meg, and Ned declined, but Fred,



<P>Sallie, Jo, and Laurie piled and drew, and the lot fell to Laurie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Who are your heroes?" asked Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Grandfather and Napoleon."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Which lady here do you think prettiest?" said Sallie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Margaret."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Which do you like best?" from Fred.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Jo, of course."



<P>"What silly questions you ask!"&nbsp; And Jo gave a disdainful



<P>shrug as the rest laughed at Laurie's matter-of-fact tone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Try again.&nbsp; Truth isn't a bad game," said Fred.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's a very good one for you," retorted Jo in a low voice.



<P>Her turn came next.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What is your greatest fault?' asked Fred, by way of testing



<P>in her the virtue he lacked himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A quick temper."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What do you most wish for?" said Laurie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A pair of boot lacings," returned Jo, guessing and defeating his purpose.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not a true answer.&nbsp; You must say what you really do want most."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Genius.&nbsp; Don't you wish you could give it to me, Laurie?"



<P>And she slyly smiled in his disappointed face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What virtues do you most admire in a man?" asked Sallie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Courage and honesty."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now my turn," said Fred, as his hand came last.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Let's give it to him," whispered Laurie to Jo, who nodded



<P>and asked at once...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Didn't you cheat at croquet?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, yes, a little bit."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Good!&nbsp; Didn't you take your story out of THE SEA LION?"



<P>said Laurie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Rather."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't you think the English nation perfect in every respect?"



<P>asked Sallie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I should be ashamed of myself if I didn't."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He's a true John Bull.&nbsp; Now, Miss Sallie, you shall have



<P>a chance without waiting to draw.&nbsp; I'll harrrow up your feelings



<P>first by asking if you don't think you are something of a flirt,"



<P>said Laurie, as Jo nodded to Fred as a sign that peace was declared.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You impertinent boy!&nbsp; Of course I'm not," exclaimed Sallie,



<P>with an air that proved the contrary.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What do you hate most?" asked Fred.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Spiders and rice pudding."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What do you like best?" asked Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dancing and French gloves."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I think Truth is a very silly play.&nbsp; Let's have a



<P>sensible game of Authors to refresh our minds," proposed Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Ned, frank, and the little girls joined in this, and while it



<P>went on, the three elders sat apart, talking.&nbsp; Miss Kate took out



<P>her sketch again, and Margaret watched her, while Mr. Brooke lay



<P>on the grass with a book, which he did not read.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How beautifully you do it!&nbsp; I wish I could draw," said Meg,



<P>with mingled admiration and regret in her voice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why don't you learn?&nbsp; I should think you had taste and talent



<P>for it," replied Miss Kate graciously.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I haven't time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your mamma prefers other accomplishments, I fancy.&nbsp; So did



<P>mine, but I proved to her that I had talent by taking a few lessons



<P>privately, and then she was quite willing I should go on.&nbsp; Can't



<P>you do the same with your governess?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have none."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I forgot young ladies in America go to school more than with



<P>us.&nbsp; Very fine schools they are, too, Papa says.&nbsp; You go to

a



<P>private one, I suppose?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't go at all.&nbsp; I am a governess myself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh.&nbsp; indeed!" said Miss Kate, but she might as well have said,



<P>"Dear me, how dreadful!" for her tone implied it, and something in



<P>her face made Meg color, and wish she had not been so frank.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Brooke looked up and said quickly, Young ladies in America



<P>love independence as much as their ancestors did, and are admired



<P>and respected for supporting themselves."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, yes, of course it's very nice and proper in them to do



<P>so.&nbsp; We have many most respectable and worthy young women who do



<P>the same and are employed by the nobility, because, being the



<P>daughters of gentlemen, they are both well bred and accomplished,



<P>you know," said Miss Kate in a patronizing tone that hurt Meg's



<P>pride, and made her work seem not only more distasteful, but



<P>degrading.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Did the German song suit, Miss March?" inquired Mr. Brooke,



<P>breaking an awkward pause.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, yes!&nbsp; It was very sweet, and I'm much obliged to whoever



<P>translated it for me." And Meg's downcast face brightened as she spoke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't you read German?" asked Miss Kate with a look of surprise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not very well.&nbsp; My father, who taught me, is away, and I don't



<P>get on very fast alone, for I've no one to correct my pronunciation."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Try a little now.&nbsp; Here is Schiller's Mary Stuart and a tutor

who



<P>loves to teach."&nbsp; And Mr. Brooke laid his book on her lap with



<P>an inviting smile.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's so hard I'm afraid to try," said Meg, grateful, but bashful



<P>in the presence of the accomplished young lady beside her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll read a bit to encourage you." And Miss Kate read one



<P>of the most beautiful passages in a perfectly correct but



<P>perfectly expressionless manner.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Brooke made no comment as she returned the book to Meg,



<P>who said innocently, "I thought it was poetry."



<P>"Some of it is.&nbsp; Try this passage."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a queer smile about Mr. Brooke's mouth as he



<P>opened at poor Mary's lament.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg obediently following the long grass-blade which her new



<P>tutor used to point with, read slowly and timidly, unconsciously



<P>making poetry of the hard words by the soft intonation of her



<P>musical voice.&nbsp; Down the page went the green guide, and presently,



<P>forgetting her listener in the beauty of the sad scene, Meg read



<P>as if alone, giving a little touch of tragedy to the words of the



<P>unhappy queen.&nbsp; If she had seen the brown eyes then, she would



<P>have stopped short, but she never looked up, and the lesson was



<P>not spoiled for her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very well indeed!" said Mr. Brooke, as she paused, quite ignoring



<P>her many mistakes, and looking as if he did indeed love to teach.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Kate put up her glass, and, having taken a survey of



<P>the little tableau before her, shut her sketch book, saying with



<P>condescension, "You've a nice accent and in time will be a clever



<P>reader.&nbsp; I advise you to learn, for German is a valuable



<P>accomplishment to teachers.&nbsp; I must look after Grace, she is romping."



<P>And Miss Kate strolled away, adding to herself with a shrug, "I



<P>didn't come to chaperone a governess, though she is young and



<P>pretty.&nbsp; What odd people these Yankees are.&nbsp; I'm afraid Laurie



<P>will be quite spoiled among them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I forgot that English people rather turn up their noses at



<P>governesses and don't treat them as we do," said Meg, looking



<P>after the retreating figure with an annoyed expression.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Tutors also have rather a hard time of it there, as I know



<P>to my sorrow.&nbsp; There's no place like America for us workers, Miss



<P>Margaret."&nbsp; And Mr. Brooke looked so contented and cheerful that



<P>Meg was ashamed to lament her hard lot.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm glad I live in it then.&nbsp; I don't like my work, but I get



<P>a good deal of satisfaction out of it after all, so I won't complain.



<P>I only wished I liked teaching as you do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think you would if you had Laurie for a pupil.&nbsp; I shall



<P>be very sorry to lose him next year," said Mr. Brooke, busily



<P>punching holes in the turf.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Going to college, I suppose?" Meg's lips asked the question,



<P>but her eyes added, "And what becomes of you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, it's high time he went, for he is ready, and as soon as



<P>he is off, I shall turn soldier.&nbsp; I am needed."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am glad of that!" exclaimed Meg.&nbsp; "I should think every



<P>young man would want to go, though it is hard for the mothers



<P>and sisters who stay at home," she added sorrowfully.



<P>"I have neither, and very few friends to care whether I live



<P>or die," said Mr. Brooke rather bitterly as he absently put the



<P>dead rose in the hole he had made and covered it up, like a



<P>little grave.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Laurie and his grandfather would care a great deal, and we



<P>should all be very sorry to have any harm happen to you," said



<P>Meg heartily.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you, that sounds pleasant," began Mr. Brooke, looking



<P>cheerful again, but before he could finish his speech, Ned, mounted



<P>on the old horse, came lumbering up to display his equestrian skill



<P>before the young ladies, and there was no more quiet that day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't you love to ride?" asked Grace of Amy, as they stood



<P>resting after a race round the field with the others, led by Ned.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I dote upon it.&nbsp; My sister, Meg, used to ride when Papa was



<P>rich, but we don't keep any horses now, except Ellen Tree," added



<P>Amy, laughing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Tell me about Ellen Tree.&nbsp; Is it a donkey?" asked Grace



<P>curiously.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, you see, Jo is crazy about horses and so am I, but



<P>we've only got an old sidesaddle and no horse.&nbsp; Out in our



<P>garden is an apple tree that has a nice low branch, so Jo put



<P>the saddle on it, fixed some reins on the part that turns up,



<P>and we bounce away on Ellen Tree whenever we like."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How funny!" laughed Grace.&nbsp; "I have a pony at home, and



<P>ride nearly every day in the park with Fred and Kate.&nbsp; It's very



<P>nice, for my friends go too, and the Row is full of ladies and



<P>gentlemen."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dear, how charming!&nbsp; I hope I shall go abroad some day,



<P>but I'd rather go to Rome than the row," said Amy, who had



<P>not the remotest idea what the Row was and wouldn't have asked



<P>for the world.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Frank, sitting just behind the little girls, heard what they



<P>were saying, and pushed his crutch away from him with an impatient



<P>gesture as he watched the active lads going through all sorts of



<P>comical gymnastics.&nbsp; Beth, who was collecting the scattered



<P>Author cards, looked up and said, in her shy yet friendly way,



<P>"I'm afraid you are tired.&nbsp; Can I do anything for you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Talk to me, please.&nbsp; It's dull, sitting by myself," answered



<P>Frank, who had evidently been used to being made much of at home.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If he asked her to deliver a Latin oration, it would not



<P>have seemed a more impossible task to bashful Beth, but there



<P>was no place to run to, no Jo to hide behind now, and the poor



<P>boy looked so wistfully at her that she bravely resolved to try.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What do you like to talk about?" she asked, fumbling over



<P>the cards and dropping half as she tried to tie them up.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I like to hear about cricket and boating and hunting,"



<P>said Frank, who had not yet learned to suit his amusements to



<P>his strength.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>My heart!&nbsp; What shall I do?&nbsp; I don't know anything about them,



<P>thought Beth, and forgetting the boy's misfortune in her flurry,



<P>she said, hoping to make him talk, "I never saw any hunting, but



<P>I suppose you know all about it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I did once, but I can never hunt again, for I got hurt leaping



<P>a confounded five-barred gate, so there are no more horses and



<P>hounds for me," said Frank with a sigh that made Beth hate herself



<P>for her innocent blunder.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your deer are much prettier than our ugly buffaloes," she



<P>said, turning to the prairies for help and feeling glad that she



<P>had read one of the boys' books in which Jo delighted.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Buffaloes proved soothing and satisfactory, and in her eagerness



<P>to amuse another, Beth forgot herself, and was quite unconscious



<P>of her sisters' surprise and delight at the unusual spectacle



<P>of Beth talking away to one of the dreadful boys, against whom she



<P>had begged protection.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Bless her heart!&nbsp; She pities him, so she is good to him,"



<P>aid Jo, beaming at her from the croquet ground.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I always said she was a little saint," added Meg, as if



<P>there could be no further doubt of it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I haven't heard Frank laugh so much for ever so long," said



<P>Grace to Amy, as they sat discussing dolls and making tea sets



<P>out of the acorn cups.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My sister Beth is a very fastidious girl, when she likes to be,"



<P>said Amy, well pleased at Beth's success.&nbsp; She meant `facinating',



<P>but as Grace didn't know the exact meaning of either word,



<P>fastidious sounded well and made a good impression.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>An impromptu circus, fox and geese, and an amicable game of



<P>croquet finished the afternoon.&nbsp; At sunset the tent was struck,



<P>hampers packed, wickets pulled up, boats loaded, and the whole



<P>party floated down the river, singing at the tops of their voices.



<P>Ned, getting sentimental, warbled a serenade with the pensive



<P>refrain...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Alone, alone, ah! Woe, alone,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>and at the lines...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>We each are young, we each have a heart,



<P>Oh, why should we stand thus coldly apart?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>he looked at Meg with such a lackadiasical expression that she



<P>laughed outright and spoiled his song.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How can you be so cruel to me?" he whispered, under cover



<P>of a lively chorus.&nbsp; "You've kept close to that starched-up



<P>Englishwoman all day, and now you snub me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I didn't mean to, but you looked so funny I really couldn't



<P>help it," replied Meg, passing over the first part of his reproach,



<P>for it was quite true that she had shunned him, remembering the



<P>Moffat party and the talk after it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Ned was offended and turned to Sallie for consolation, saying



<P>to her rather pettishly, "There isn't a bit of flirt in that girl,



<P>is there?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not a particle, but she's a dear," returned Sallie, defending



<P>her friend even while confessing her shortcomings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She's not a stricken deer anyway," said Ned, trying to be



<P>witty, and succeeding as well as very young gentlemen usually do.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On the lawn where it had gathered, the little party separated



<P>with cordial good nights and good-bys, for the Vaughns were going



<P>to Canada.&nbsp; As the four sisters went home through the garden, Miss



<P>Kate looked after them, saying, without the patronizing tone in



<P>her voice, "In spite of their demonstrative manners, American girls



<P>are very nice when one knows them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I quite agree with you," said Mr. Brooke.

<B>CHAPTER FORTY</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the first bitterness was over, the family accepted



<P>the inevitable, and tried to bear it cheerfully, helping one



<P>another by the increased affection which comes to bind households



<P>tenderly together in times of trouble.&nbsp; They put away their grief,



<P>and each did his or her part toward making that last year a happy one.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The pleasantest room in the house was set apart for Beth,



<P>and in it was gathered everything that she most loved, flowers,



<P>pictures, her piano, the little worktable, and the beloved



<P>pussies.&nbsp; Father's best books found their way there, Mother's



<P>easy chair, Jo's desk, Amy's finest sketches, and every day



<P>Meg brought her babies on a loving pilgrimage, to make sunshine



<P>for Aunty Beth.&nbsp; John quietly set apart a little sum, that he



<P>might enjoy the pleasure of keeping the invalid supplied with



<P>the fruit she loved and longed for.&nbsp; Old Hannah never wearied



<P>of concocting dainty dishes to tempt a capricious appetite,



<P>dropping tears as she worked, and from across the sea came



<P>little gifts and cheerful letters, seeming to bring breaths



<P>of warmth and fragrance from lands that know no winter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here, cherished like a household saint in its shrine, sat



<P>Beth, tranquil and busy as ever, for nothing could change the



<P>sweet, unselfish nature, and even while preparing to leave



<P>life, she tried to make it happier for those who should remain



<P>behind.&nbsp; The feeble fingers were never idle, and one of her



<P>pleasures was to make little things for the school children



<P>daily passing to and fro, to drop a pair of mittens from her



<P>window for a pair of purple hands, a needlebook for some small



<P>mother of many dolls, penwipers for young penmen toiling through



<P>forests of pothooks, scrapbooks for picture-loving eyes, and



<P>all manner of pleasant devices, till the reluctant climbers of



<P>the ladder of learning found their way strewn with flowers, as



<P>it were, and came to regard the gentle giver as a sort of fairy



<P>godmother, who sat above there, and showered down gifts miraculously



<P>suited to their tastes and needs.&nbsp; If Beth had wanted any



<P>reward, she found it in the bright little faces always turned up



<P>to her window, with nods and smiles, and the droll little letters



<P>which came to her, full of blots and gratitude.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The first few months were very happy ones, and Beth often



<P>used to look round, and say "How beautiful this is!" as they



<P>all sat together in her sunny room, the babies kicking and crowing



<P>on the floor, mother and sisters working near, and father



<P>reading, in his pleasant voice, from the wise old books which



<P>seemed rich in good and comfortable words, as applicable now as



<P>when written centuries ago, a little chapel, where a paternal



<P>priest taught his flock the hard lessons all must learn, trying



<P>to show them that hope can comfort love, and faith make resignation



<P>possible.&nbsp; Simple sermons, that went straight to the souls of



<P>those who listened, for the father's heart was in the minister's



<P>religion, and the frequent falter in the voice gave a double



<P>eloquence to the words he spoke or read.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was well for all that this peaceful time was given them



<P>as preparation for the sad hours to come, for by-and-by, Beth



<P>said the needle was `so heavy', and put it down forever.&nbsp; Talking



<P>wearied her, faces troubled her, pain claimed her for its own,



<P>and her tranquil spirit was sorrowfully perturbed by the ills



<P>that vexed her feeble flesh.&nbsp; Ah me!&nbsp; Such heavy days, such

long,



<P>long nights, such aching hearts and imploring prayers, when those



<P>who loved her best were forced to see the thin hands stretched out



<P>to them beseechingly, to hear the bitter cry, "Help me, help me!"



<P>and to feel that there was no help.&nbsp; A sad eclipse of the serene



<P>soul, a sharp struggle of the young life with death, but both were



<P>mercifully brief, and then the natural rebellion over, the old peace



<P>returned more beautiful than ever.&nbsp; With the wreck of her frail

body,



<P>Beth's soul grew strong, and though she said little, those about her



<P>felt that she was ready, saw that the first pilgrim called was likewise



<P>the fittest, and waited with her on the shore, trying to see the



<P>Shining Ones coming to receive her when she crossed the river.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo never left her for an hour since Beth had said "I feel



<P>stronger when you are here."&nbsp; She slept on a couch in the room,



<P>waking often to renew the fire, to feed, lift, or wait upon the



<P>patient creature who seldom asked for anything, and `tried not to



<P>be a trouble'.&nbsp; All day she haunted the room, jealous of any other



<P>nurse, and prouder of being chosen then than of any honor her life



<P>ever brought her.&nbsp; Precious and helpful hours to Jo, for now her



<P>heart received the teaching that it needed.&nbsp; Lessons in patience



<P>were so sweetly taught her that she could not fail to learn them,



<P>charity for all, the lovely spirit that can forgive and truly



<P>forget unkindness, the loyalty to duty that makes the hardest



<P>easy, and the sincere faith that fears nothing, but trusts undoubtingly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Often when she woke Jo found Beth reading in her well-worn



<P>little book, heard her singing softly, to beguile the sleepless



<P>night, or saw her lean her face upon her hands, while slow tears



<P>dropped through the transparent fingers, and Jo would lie watching



<P>her with thoughts too deep for tears, feeling that Beth, in



<P>her simple, unselfish way, was trying to wean herself from the



<P>dear old life, and fit herself for the life to come, by sacred



<P>words of comfort, quiet prayers, and the music she loved so well.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Seeing this did more for Jo than the wisest sermons, the



<P>saintliest hymns, the most fervent prayers that any voice could



<P>utter.&nbsp; For with eyes made clear by many tears, and a heart



<P>softened by the tenderest sorrow, she recognized the beauty of



<P>her sister's life--uneventful, unambitious, yet full of the



<P>genuine virtues which `smell sweet, and blossom in the dust',



<P>the self-forgetfulness that makes the humblest on earth remembered



<P>soonest in heaven, the true success which is possible to all.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One night when Beth looked among the books upon her table,



<P>to find something to make her forget the mortal weariness that



<P>was almost as hard to bear as pain, as she turned the leaves of



<P>her old favorite, Pilgrims's Progress, she found a little paper,



<P>scribbled over in Jo's hand.&nbsp; The name caught her eye and the



<P>blurred look of the lines made her sure that tears had fallen



<P>on it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Poor Jo!&nbsp; She's fast asleep, so I won't wake her to ask



<P>leave.&nbsp; She shows me all her things, and I don't think she'll



<P>mind if I look at this", thought Beth, with a glance at her



<P>sister, who lay on the rug, with the tongs beside her, ready



<P>to wake up the minute the log fell apart.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>MY BETH

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sitting patient in the shadow



<P>Till the blessed light shall come,



<P>A serene and saintly presence



<P>Sanctifies our troubled home.



<P>Earthly joys and hopes and sorrows



<P>Break like ripples on the strand



<P>Of the deep and solemn river



<P>Where her willing feet now stand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>O my sister, passing from me,



<P>Out of human care and strife,



<P>Leave me, as a gift, those virtues



<P>Which have beautified your life.



<P>Dear, bequeath me that great patience



<P>Which has power to sustain



<P>A cheerful, uncomplaining spirit



<P>In its prison-house of pain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Give me, for I need it sorely,



<P>Of that courage, wise and sweet,



<P>Which has made the path of duty



<P>Green beneath your willing feet.



<P>Give me that unselfish nature,



<P>That with charity devine



<P>Can pardon wrong for love's dear sake--



<P>Meek heart, forgive me mine!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Thus our parting daily loseth



<P>Something of its bitter pain,



<P>And while learning this hard lesson,



<P>My great loss becomes my gain.



<P>For the touch of grief will render



<P>My wild nature more serene,



<P>Give to life new aspirations,



<P>A new trust in the unseen.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Henceforth, safe across the river,



<P>I shall see forever more



<P>A beloved, household spirit



<P>Waiting for me on the shore.



<P>Hope and faith, born of my sorrow,



<P>Guardian angels shall become,



<P>And the sister gone before me



<P>By their hands shall lead me home.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Blurred and blotted, faulty and feeble as the lines were, they



<P>brought a look of inexpressible comfort to Beth's face, for her one



<P>regret had been that she had done so little, and this seemed to assure



<P>her that her life had not been useless, that her death would not bring



<P>the despair she feared.&nbsp; As she sat with the paper folded between

her



<P>hands, the charred log fell asunder.&nbsp; Jo started up, revived the

blaze,



<P>and crept to the bedside, hoping Beth slept.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not asleep, but so happy, dear.&nbsp; See, I found this and read it.



<P>I knew you wouldn't care.&nbsp; Have I been all that to you, Jo?" she



<P>asked, with wistful, humble earnestness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"OH, Beth, so much, so much!"&nbsp; And Jo's head went down upon the



<P>pillow beside her sister's.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then I don't feel as if I'd wasted my life.&nbsp; I'm not so good



<P>as you make me, but I have tried to do right.&nbsp; And now, when it's



<P>too late to begin even to do better, it's such a comfort to know



<P>that someone loves me so much, and feels as if I'd helped them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"More than any one in the world, Beth.&nbsp; I used to think I



<P>couldn't let you go, but I'm learning to feel that I don't lose



<P>you, that you'll be more to me than ever, and death can't part



<P>us, though it seems to."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I know it cannot, and I don't fear it any longer, for I'm



<P>sure I shall be your Beth still, to love and help you more than



<P>ever.&nbsp; You must take my place, Jo, and be everything to Father



<P>and Mother when I'm gone.&nbsp; They will turn to you, don't fail



<P>them, and if it's hard to work alone, remember that I don't



<P>forget you, and that you'll be happier in doing that than writing



<P>splendid books or seeing all the world, for love is the only thing



<P>that we can carry with us when we go, and it makes the go easy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll try, Beth."&nbsp; And then and there Jo renounced her old



<P>ambition, pledged herself to a new and better one, acknowledging



<P>the poverty of other desires, and feeling the blessed solace of



<P>a belief in the immortality of love.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So the spring days came and went , the sky grew clearer, the



<P>earth greener, the flowers were up fairly early, and the birds



<P>came back in time to say goodbye to Beth, who, like a tired but



<P>trustful child, clung to the hands that had led her all her life,



<P>as Father and Mother guided her tenderly through the Valley of



<P>the Shadow, and gave her up to God.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Seldom except in books do the dying utter memorable words,



<P>see visions, or depart with beatified countenances, and those



<P>who have sped many parting souls know that to most the end



<P>comes as naturally and simply as sleep.&nbsp; As Beth had hoped, the



<P>`tide went out easily', and in the dark hour before dawn, on



<P>the bosom where she had drawn her first breath, she quietly



<P>drew her last, with no farewell but one loving look, one little



<P>sigh.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With tears and prayers and tender hands, Mother and sisters



<P>made her ready for the long sleep that pain would never mar again,



<P>seeing with grateful eyes the beautiful serenity that soon replaced



<P>the pathetic patience that had wrung their hearts so long, and



<P>feeling with reverent joy that to their darling death was a



<P>benignant angel, not a phantom full of dread.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When morning came, for the first time in many months the



<P>fire was out, Jo's place was empty, and the room was very still.



<P>But a bird sang blithely on a budding bough, close by, the snowdrops



<P>blossomed freshly at the window, and the spring sunshine streamed



<P>in like a benediction over the placid face upon the pillow,



<P>a face so full of painless peace that those who loved it best



<P>smiled through their tears, and thanked God that Beth was well at last.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy's lecture did Laurie good, though, of course, he did



<P>not own it till long afterward.&nbsp; Men seldom do, for when women



<P>are the advisers, the lords of creation don't take the advice



<P>till they have persuaded themselves that it is just what they



<P>intended to do.&nbsp; Then they act upon it, and, if it succeeds,



<P>they give the weaker vessel half the credit of it.&nbsp; If it



<P>fails, they generously give her the whole.&nbsp; Laurie went back



<P>to his grandfather, and was so dutifully devoted for several



<P>weeks that the old gentleman declared the climate of Nice had



<P>improved him wonderfully, and he had better try it again.



<P>There was nothing the young gentleman would have liked better,



<P>but elephants could not have dragged him back after the scolding



<P>he had received.&nbsp; Pride forbid, and whenever the longing



<P>grew very strong, he fortified his resolution by repeating



<P>the words that had made the deepest impression, "I despise you."



<P>"Go and do something splendid that will make her love you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie turned the matter over in his mind so often that he soon



<P>brought himself to confess that he had been selfish and lazy,



<P>but then when a man has a great sorrow, he should be indulged



<P>in all sorts of vagaries till he has lived it down.&nbsp; He felt



<P>that his blighted affections were quite dead now, and though



<P>he should never cease to be a faithful mourner, there was



<P>no occasion to wear his weeds ostentatiously.&nbsp; Jo wouldn't



<P>love him, but he might make her respect and admire him by doing



<P>something which should prove that a girl's no had not spoiled



<P>his life.&nbsp; He had always meant to do something, and Amy's



<P>advice was quite unnecessary.&nbsp; He had only been waiting till



<P>the aforesaid blighted affections were decently interred.



<P>That being done, he felt that he was ready to `hide his



<P>stricken heart, and still toil on'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As Goethe, when he had a joy or a grief, put it into a song,



<P>so Laurie resolved to embalm his love sorrow in music, and to



<P>compose a Requiem which should harrow up Jo's soul and melt the



<P>heart of every hearer.&nbsp; Therefore the next time the old gentleman



<P>found him getting restless and moody and ordered him off,



<P>he went to Vienna, where he had musical friends, and fell to



<P>work with the firm determination to distinguish himself.&nbsp; But



<P>whether the sorrow was too vast to be embodied in music, or



<P>music too ethereal to uplift a mortal woe, he soon discovered



<P>that the Requiem was beyond him just at present.&nbsp; It was evident



<P>that his mind was not in working order yet, and his ideas



<P>needed clarifying, for often in the middle of a plaintive strain,



<P>he would find himself humming a dancing tune that vividly recalled



<P>the Christmas ball at Nice, especially the stout Frenchman,



<P>and put an effectual stop to tragic composition for the time being.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then he tried an opera, for nothing seemed impossible in



<P>the beginning, but here again unforeseen difficulties beset



<P>him.&nbsp; He wanted Jo for his heroine, and called upon his memory



<P>to supply him with tender recollections and romantic visions



<P>of his love.&nbsp; But memory turned traitor, and as if possessed



<P>by the perverse spirit of the girl, would only recall Jo's



<P>oddities, faults, and freaks, would only show her in the most



<P>unsentimental aspects--beating mats with her head tied up in



<P>a bandana, barricading herself with the sofa pillow, or throwing



<P>cold water over his passion a la Gummidge--and an irresistable



<P>laugh spoiled the pensive picture he was endeavoring to



<P>paint.&nbsp; Jo wouldn't be put into the opera at any price, and he



<P>had to give her up with a "Bless that girl, what a torment she is!"



<P>and a clutch at his hair, as became a distracted composer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When he looked about him for another and a less intractable



<P>damsel to immortalize in melody, memory produced one with the



<P>most obliging readiness.&nbsp; This phantom wore many faces, but it



<P>always had golden hair, was enveloped in a diaphanous cloud, and



<P>floated airily before his mind's eye in a pleasing chaos of roses,



<P>peacocks, white ponies, and blue ribbons.&nbsp; He did not give the



<P>complacent wraith any name, but he took her for his heroine and



<P>grew quite fond of her, as well he might, for he gifted her with



<P>every gift and grace under the sun, and escorted her, unscathed,



<P>through trials which would have annihilated any mortal woman.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Thanks to this inspiration, he got on swimmingly for a time,



<P>but gradually the work lost its charm, and he forgot to compose,



<P>while he sat musing, pen in hand, or roamed about the gay city



<P>to get some new ideas and refresh his mind, which seemed to be



<P>in a somewhat unsettled state that winter.&nbsp; He did not do much,



<P>but he thought a great deal and was conscious of a change of



<P>some sort going on in spite of himself.&nbsp; "It's genius simmering,



<P>perhaps.&nbsp; I'll let it simmer, and see what comes of it," he said,



<P>with a secret suspicion all the while that it wasn't genius, but



<P>something far more common.&nbsp; Whatever it was, it simmered to



<P>some purpose, for he grew more and more discontented with his



<P>desultory life, began to long for some real and earnest work



<P>to go at, soul and body, and finally came to the wise conclusion



<P>that everyone who loved music was not a composer.&nbsp; Returning



<P>from one of Mozart's grand operas, splendidly performed at



<P>the Royal Theatre, he looked over his own, played a few of the



<P>best parts, sat staring at the busts of Mendelssohn, Beethoven,



<P>and bach, who stared benignly back again.&nbsp; Then suddenly he



<P>tore up his music sheets, one by one, and as the last fluttered



<P>out of his hand, he said soberly to himself...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She is right!&nbsp; Talent isn't genius, and you can't make it



<P>so.&nbsp; That music has taken the vanity out of my as Rome took it



<P>out of her, and I won't be a humbug any longer.&nbsp; Now what shall



<P>I do?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That seemed a hard question to answer, and Laurie began to



<P>wish he had to work for his daily bread.&nbsp; Now if ever, occurred



<P>an eligible opportunity for `going to the devil', as he once



<P>forcibly expressed it, for he had plenty of money and nothing



<P>to do, and Satan is proverbially fond of providing employment



<P>for full and idle hands.&nbsp; The poor fellow had temptations



<P>enough from without and from within, but he withstood them



<P>pretty well, for much as he valued liberty, he valued good



<P>faith and confidence more, so his promise to his grandfather,



<P>and his desire to be able to look honestly into the eyes of



<P>the women who loved him, and say "All's well," kept him safe



<P>and steady.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Very likely some Mrs. Grundy will observe, "I don't believe it,



<P>boys will be boys, young men must sow their wild oats,



<P>and women must not expect miracles."&nbsp; I dare say you don't,



<P>Mrs. Grundy, but it's true nevertheless.&nbsp; Women work



<P>a good many miracles, and I have a persuasion that they may



<P>perform even that of raising the standard of manhood by



<P>refusing to echo such sayings.&nbsp; Let the boys be boys, the



<P>longer the better, and let the young men sow their wild oats



<P>if they must.&nbsp; But mothers, sisters, and friends may help to



<P>make the crop a small one, and keep many tares from spoiling



<P>the harvest, by believing, and showing that they believe, in



<P>the possibility of loyalty to the virtues which make men manliest



<P>in good women's eyes.&nbsp; If it is a feminine delusion,&nbsp; leave

us



<P>to enjoy it while we may, for without it half the beauty and



<P>the romance of life is lost, and sorrowful forebodings would



<P>embitter all our hopes of the brave, tenderhearted little lads,



<P>who still love their mothers better than themselves and are



<P>not ashamed to own it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie thought that the task of forgetting his love for Jo



<P>would absorb all his powers for years, but to his great surprise



<P>he discovered it grew easier every day.&nbsp; He refused to believe



<P>it at first, got angry with himself, and couldn't understand it,



<P>but these hearts of ours are curious and contrary things, and



<P>time and nature work their will in spite of us.&nbsp; Laurie's heart



<P>wouldn't ache.&nbsp; The wound persisted in healing with a rapidity



<P>that astonished him, and instead of trying to forget, he found



<P>himself trying to remember.&nbsp; He had not foreseen this turn of



<P>affairs, and was not prepared for it.&nbsp; He was disgusted with



<P>himself, surprised at his own fickleness, and full of a



<P>queer mixture of disappointment and relief that he could



<P>recover from such a tremendous blow so soon.&nbsp; He carefully



<P>stirred up the embers of his lost love, but they refused to



<P>burst into a blaze.&nbsp; There was only a comfortable glow that



<P>warmed and did him good without putting him into a fever,



<P>and he was reluctantly obliged to confess that the boyish



<P>passion was slowly subbsiding into a more tranquil sentiment,



<P>very tender, a little sad and resentful still, but that was



<P>sure to pass away in time, leaving a brotherly affection



<P>which would last unbroken to the end.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As the word `brotherly' passed through his mind in one



<P>of his reveries, he smiled, and glanced up at the picture of



<P>Mozart that was before him...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, he was a great man, and when he couldn't have



<P>one sister he took the other, and was happy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie did not utter the words, but he thought them, and



<P>the next instant kissed the little old ring, saying to himself,



<P>"No, I won't!&nbsp; I haven't forgotten, I never can.&nbsp; I'll try

again,



<P>and if that fails, why then...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Leaving his sentence unfinished, he seized pen and paper



<P>and wrote to Jo, telling her that he could not settle to anything



<P>while there was the least hope of her changing her mind.



<P>Couldn't she, wouldn't she, and let him come home and be happy?



<P>While waiting for an answer he did nothing, but he did it



<P>energetically, for he was in a fever of impatience.&nbsp; It came



<P>at last, and settled his mind effectually on one point, for Jo



<P>decidedly couldn't and wouldn't.&nbsp; She was wrapped up in Beth,



<P>and never wished to hear the word love again.&nbsp; Then she begged



<P>him to be happy with somebody else, but always keep a little



<P>corner of his ghart for his loving sister Jo.&nbsp; In a postscript



<P>she desired him not to tell Amy that Beth was worse, she was



<P>coming home in the spring and there was no need of saddening



<P>the remainder of her stay.&nbsp; That would be time enough, please



<P>God, but Laurie must write to her often, and not let her feel



<P>lonely, homesick or anxious.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So I will, at once.&nbsp; Poor little girl, it will be a sad



<P>going home for her, I'm afraid."&nbsp; And Laurie opened his desk,



<P>as if writing to Amy had been the proper conclusion of the



<P>sentence left unfinished some weeks before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But he did not write the letter that day, for as he rummaged



<P>out his best paper, he came across something which



<P>changed his purpose.&nbsp; Tumbling about in one part of the desk



<P>among bills, passports, and business documents of various kinds



<P>were several of Jo's letters, and in another compartment were



<P>three notes from Amy, carefully tied up with one of her blue



<P>ribbons and sweetly suggestive of the little dead roses put



<P>away inside.&nbsp; with a half-repentant, half-amused expression,



<P>Laurie gathered up all Jo's letters, smoothed, folded, and put



<P>them neatly into a small drawer of the desk, stood a minute



<P>turning the ring thoughtfully on his finger, then slowly drew



<P>it off, laid it with the letters, locked the drawer, and went



<P>out to hear High Mass at Saint Stefan's, feeling as if there



<P>had been a funeral, and though not overwhelmed with affliction,



<P>this seemed a more proper way to spend the rest of the day than



<P>in writing letters to charming young ladies.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The letter went very soon, however, and was promptly answered,



<P>for Amy was homesick, and confessed it in the most



<P>delightfully confiding manner.&nbsp; The correspondence flourished



<P>famously, and letters flew to and fro with unfailing regularity



<P>all through the early spring.&nbsp; Laurie sold his busts, made



<P>allumettes of his opera, and went back to Paris, hoping somebody



<P>would arrive before long.&nbsp; He wanted desperately to go



<P>to Nice, but would not till he was asked, and Amy would not



<P>ask him, for just then she was having little experiences of



<P>her own, which made her rather wish to avoid the quizzical



<P>eyes of `out boy'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fred Vaughn had returned, and put the question to which



<P>she had once decided to answer, "Yes, thank you," but now she



<P>said, "No, thank you," kindly but steadily, for when the time



<P>came, her courage failed her, and she found that something



<P>more than money and position was needed to satisfy the new



<P>longing that filled her heart so full of tender hopes and



<P>fears.&nbsp; The words, "Fred is a good fellow, but not at all



<P>the man I fancied you would ever like," and Laurie's face



<P>when he uttered them, kept returning to her as pertinaciously



<P>as her own did when she said in look, if not in words, "I



<P>shall marry for money."&nbsp; It troubled her to remember that



<P>now, she wished she could take it back, it sounded so unwomanly.



<P>She didn't want Laurie to think her a heartless,&nbsp; worldly



<P>creature.&nbsp; She didn't care to be a queen of society now



<P>half so much as she did to be a lovable woman.&nbsp; She was



<P>so glad he didn't hate her for the dreadful things she said,



<P>but took them so beautifully and was kinder than ever.&nbsp; His



<P>letters were such a comfort, for the home letters were very



<P>irregular and not half so satisfactory as his when they did



<P>come.&nbsp; It was not only a pleasure, but a duty to answer them,



<P>for the poor fellow was forlorn, and needed petting, since Jo



<P>persisted in being stonyhearted.&nbsp; She ought to have made an



<P>effort and tried to love him.&nbsp; It couldn't be very hard,



<P>many people would be proud and glad to have such a dear boy



<P>care for them.&nbsp; But Jo never would act like other girls, so



<P>there was nothing to do but be very kind and treat him like



<P>a brother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If all brothers were treated as well as Laurie was at



<P>this period, they would be a much happier race of beings than



<P>they are.&nbsp; Amy never lectured now.&nbsp; She asked his opinion

on



<P>all subjects, she was interested in everything he did, made



<P>charming little presents for him, and sent him two letters



<P>a week, full of lively gossip, sisterly confidences, and



<P>captivating sketches of the lovely scenes about her.&nbsp; As few



<P>brothers are complimented by having their letters carried



<P>about in their sister's pockets, read and reread diligently,



<P>cried over when short, kissed when long, and treasured carefully,



<P>we will not hint that Amy did any of these fond and



<P>foolish things.&nbsp; But she certainly did grow a little pale



<P>and pensive that spring, lost much of her relish for society,



<P>and went out sketching alone a good deal.&nbsp; She never had much



<P>to show when she came home, but was studying nature, I dare



<P>say, while she sat for hours, with her hands folded, on the



<P>terrace at Valrosa, or absently sketched any fancy that



<P>occurred to her, a stalwart knight carved on a tomb, a young



<P>man asleep in the grass, with his hat over his eyes, or a curly



<P>haired girl in gorgeous array, promenading down a ballroom on



<P>the arm of a tall gentleman, both faces being left a blur



<P>according to the last fashion in art, which was safe but not



<P>altogether satisfactory.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her aunt thought that she regretted her answer to Fred,



<P>and finding denials useless and explanations impossible, Amy



<P>left her to think what she liked, taking care that Laurie



<P>should know that Fred had gone to Egypt.&nbsp; That was all, but



<P>he understood it, and looked relieved, as he said to himself,



<P>with a venerable air .&nbsp; ..

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was sure she would think better of it.&nbsp; Poor old fellow!



<P>I've been through it all, and I can sympathize."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With that he heaved a great sigh, and then, as if he had



<P>discharged his duty to the past, put his feet up on the sofa



<P>and enjoyed Amy's letter luxuriously.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While these changes were going on abroad, trouble had



<P>come at home.&nbsp; But the letter telling that Beth was failing



<P>never reached Amy, and when the next found her at Vevay, for



<P>the heat had driven them from Nice in May, and they had travelled



<P>slowly to Switzerland, by way of Genoa and the Italian



<P>lakes.&nbsp; She bore it very well, and quietly submitted to the



<P>family decree that she should not shorten her visit, for



<P>since it was too late to say goodbye to Beth, she had better



<P>stay, and let absence soften her sorrow.&nbsp; But her heart was



<P>very heavy, she longed to be at home, and every day looked



<P>wistfully across the lake, waiting for Laurie to come and



<P>comfort her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He did come very soon, for the same mail brought letters



<P>to them both, but he was in Germany, and it took some days to



<P>reach him.&nbsp; The moment he read it, he packed his knapsack,



<P>bade adieu to his fellow pedestrians, and was off to keep his



<P>promise, with a heart full of joy and sorrow, hope and suspense.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He knew Vevay well, and as soon as the boat touched the



<P>little quay, he hurried along the shore to La Tour, where the



<P>Carrols were living en pension.&nbsp; The garcon was in despair



<P>that the whole family had gone to take a promenade on the



<P>lake, but no, the blonde mademoiselle might be in the chateau



<P>garden.&nbsp; If monsier would give himself the pain of sitting



<P>down, a flash of time should present her.&nbsp; But monsieur could



<P>not wait even a `flash of time', and in the middle of the



<P>speech departed to find mademoiselle himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A pleasant old garden on the borders of the lovely lake,



<P>with chestnuts rustling overhead, ivy climbing everywhere, and



<P>the black shadow of the tower falling far across the sunny



<P>water.&nbsp; At one corner of the wide, low wall was a seat, and here



<P>Amy often came to read or work, or console herself with the



<P>beauty all about her.&nbsp; She was sitting here that day, leaning



<P>her head on her hand, with a homesick heart and heavy eyes,



<P>thinking of Beth and wondering why Laurie did not come.&nbsp; She



<P>did not hear him cross the courtyard beyond, nor see him pause



<P>in the archway that led from the subterranean path into the



<P>garden.&nbsp; He stood a minute looking at her with new eyes, seeing



<P>what no one had ever seen before, the tender side of Amy's character.



<P>Everything about her mutely suggested love and sorrow,



<P>the blotted letters in her lap, the black ribbon that tied up



<P>her hair, the womanly pain and patience in her face, even the



<P>little ebony cross at her throat seemed pathetic to Laurie,



<P>for he had given it to her, and she wore it as her only ornament.



<P>If he had any doubts about the reception she would give



<P>him, they were set at rest the minute she looked up and saw



<P>him, for dropping everything, she ran to him, exclaiming in a



<P>tone of unmistakable love and longing...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, Laurie, Laurie, I knew you'd come to me!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I think everything was said and settled then, for as they



<P>stood together quite silent for a moment, with the dark head



<P>bent down protectingly over the light one, Amy felt that no



<P>one could comfort and sustain her so well as Laurie, and



<P>Laurie decided that Amy was the only woman in the world who



<P>could fill Jo's place and make him happy.&nbsp; He did not tell her



<P>so, but she was not disappointed, for both felt the truth,



<P>were satisfied, and gladly left the rest to silence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In a minute Amy went back to her place, and while she



<P>dried her tears, Laurie gathered up the scattered papers,



<P>finding in the sight of sundry well-worn letters and suggestive



<P>sketches good omens for the future.&nbsp; As he sat down beside her,



<P>amy felt shy again, and turned rosy red at the recollection of



<P>her impulsive greeting.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I couldn't help it, I felt so lonely and sad, and was so



<P>very glad to see you.&nbsp; It was such a surprise to look up and find



<P>you, just as I was beginning to fear you wouldn't come," she said,



<P>trying in vain to speak quite naturally.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I came the minute I heard.&nbsp; I wish I could say something



<P>to comfort you for the loss of dear little Beth, but I can only



<P>feel, and..."&nbsp; He could not get any further, for her too



<P>turned bashful all of a sudden, and did not quite know what to



<P>say.&nbsp; He longed to lay Amy's head down on his shoulder, and tell



<P>her to have a good cry, but he did not dare, so took her hand



<P>instead, and gave it a sympathetic squeeze that was better than



<P>words.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You needn't say anything, this comforts me," she said



<P>softly.&nbsp; "Beth is well and happy, and I mustn't wish her back,



<P>but I dread the going home, much as I long to see them all.



<P>We won't talk about it now, for it makes me cry, and I want



<P>to enjoy you while you stay.&nbsp; You needn't go right back, need



<P>you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not if you want me, dear."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do, so much.&nbsp; Aunt and Flo are very kind, but you



<P>seem like one of the family, and it would be so comfortable to



<P>have you for a little while."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy spoke and looked so like a homesick child whose heart



<P>was full that Laurie forgot his bashfulness all at once, and



<P>gave her just what she wanted--the petting she was used to and



<P>the cheerful conversation she needed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Poor little soul, you look as if you'd grieved yourself



<P>half sick!&nbsp; I'm going to take care of you, so don't cry any



<P>more, but come and walk about with me, the wind is too chilly



<P>for you to sit still," he said, in the half-caressing,



<P>half-commanding way that Amy liked, as he tied on her hat,



<P>drew her arm through his, and began to pace up and down the



<P>sunny walk under the new-leaved chestnuts.&nbsp; He felt more at



<P>ease upon his legs, and Amy found it pleasant to have a strong



<P>arm to lean upon, a familiar face to smile at her, and a kind



<P>voice to talk delightfully for her alone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The quaint old garden had sheltered many pairs of lovers,



<P>and seemed expressly made for them, so sunny and secluded was



<P>it, with nothing but the tower to overlook them, and the wide



<P>lake to carry away the echo of their words, as it rippled by



<P>below.&nbsp; For an hour this new pair walked and talked, or rested



<P>on the wall, enjoying the sweet influences which gave such a



<P>charm to time and place, and when an unromantic dinner bell



<P>warned them away, Amy felt as if she left her burden of



<P>lonliness and sorrow behind her in the chateau garden.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The moment Mrs. Carrol saw the girl's altered face, she



<P>was illuminated with a new idea, and exclaimed to herself,



<P>"Now I understand it all--the child has been pining for young



<P>Laurence.&nbsp; Bless my heart, I never thought of such a thing!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With praiseworthy discretion, the good lady said nothing,



<P>and betrayed no sign of enlightenment, but cordially urged



<P>Laurie to stay and begged Amy to enjoy his society, for it



<P>would do her more good than so much solitude.&nbsp; Amy was a



<P>model of docility, and as her aunt was a good deal occupied



<P>with Flo, she was left to entertain her friend, and did it



<P>with more than her usual success.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At Nice, Laurie had lounged and Amy had scolded.&nbsp; At



<P>Vevay, Laurie was never idle, but always walking, riding,



<P>boating, or studying in the most energetic manner, while



<P>Amy admired everything he did and followed his example as



<P>far and as fast as she could.&nbsp; He said the change was owing



<P>to the climate, and she did not contradict him, being glad



<P>of a like excuse for her own recovered health and spirits.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The invigorating air did them both good, and much exercise



<P>worked wholesome changes in minds as well as bodies.



<P>They seemed to get clearer views of life and duty up there



<P>among the everlasting hills.&nbsp; The fresh winds blew away



<P>desponding doubts, delusive fancies, and moody mists.&nbsp; The



<P>warm spring sunshine brought out all sorts of aspiring ideas,



<P>tender hopes, and happy thoughts.&nbsp; The lake seemed to wash



<P>away the troubles of the past, and the grand old mountains



<P>to look benignly down upon them saying, "Little children,



<P>love one another."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In spite of the new sorrow, it was a very happy time, so



<P>happy that Laurie could not bear to disturb it by a word.&nbsp; It



<P>took him a little while to recover from his surprise at the



<P>cure of his first, and as he had firmly believed, his last



<P>and only love.&nbsp; He consoled himself for the seeming disloyalty



<P>by the thought that Jo's sister was almost the same as Jo's



<P>self, and the conviction that it would have been impossible



<P>to love any other woman but Amy so soon and so well.&nbsp; His first



<P>wooing had been of the tempestuous order, and he looked back



<P>upon ;it as if through a long vista of years with a feeling of



<P>compassion blended with regret.&nbsp; He was not ashamed of it,



<P>but put it away as one of the bitter-sweet experiences of his



<P>life, for which he could be grateful when the pain was over.



<P>His second wooing, he resolved, should be as calm and simple



<P>as possible.&nbsp; There was no need of having a scene, hardly



<P>any need of telling Amy that he loved her, she knew it without



<P>words and had given him his answer long ago.&nbsp; It all came



<P>about so naturally that no one could complain, and he knew that



<P>everybody would be pleased, even Jo.&nbsp; But when our first little



<P>passion has been crushed, we are apt to be wary and slow in making



<P>a second trial, so Laurie let the days pass, enjoying every hour,



<P>and leaving to chance the utterance of the word that would



<P>put an end to the first and sweetest part of his new romance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had rather imagined that the denoument would take place



<P>in the chateau garden by moonlight, and in the most graceful and



<P>decorus manner, but it turned out exactly the reverse, for the



<P>matter was settled on the lake at noonday in a few blunt words.



<P>They had been floating about all the morning, from gloomy



<P>St. Gingolf to sunny Montreux, with the Alps of Savoy on one side,



<P>Mont St. Bernard and the Dent du Midi on the other, pretty Vevay in



<P>the valley, and Lausanne upon the hill beyond, a cloudless blue



<P>sky overhead, and the bluer lake below, dotted with the picturesque



<P>boats that look like white-winged gulls.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They had been talking of Bonnivard, as they glided past



<P>Chillon, and of Rousseau, as they looked up at Clarens, where he



<P>wrote his Heloise.&nbsp; Neither had read it, but they knew it was a



<P>love story, and each privately wondered if it was half as interesting



<P>as their own.&nbsp; Amy had been dabbling her hand in the water



<P>during the little pause that fell between them, and when she looked



<P>up, Laurie was leaning on his oars with an expression in his eyes



<P>that made her say hastily, merely for the sake of saying something .&nbsp;

.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You must be tired.&nbsp; Rest a little, and let me row.&nbsp; It will

do me good,



<P>for since you came I have been altogether lazy and luxurious."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm not tired, but you may take an oar, if you like.&nbsp; There's



<P>room enough, though I have to sit nearly in the middle, else the



<P>boat won't trim," returned Laurie, as if he rather liked the arrangment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Feeling that she had not mended matters much, Amy took the



<P>offered third of a seat, shook her hair over her face, and accepted



<P>an oar.&nbsp; She rowed as well as she did many other things, and though



<P>she used both hands, and Laurie but one, the oars kept time, and



<P>the boat went smoothly through the water.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How well we pull together, don't we?" said Amy, who objected



<P>to silence just then.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So well that I wish we might always pull in the same boat.



<P>Will you, Amy?" very tenderly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, Laurie," very low.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then they both stopped rowing, and unconsciously added a



<P>pretty little tableau of human love and happiness to the dissolving



<P>views reflected in the lake.

<B>CHAPTER FORTY-THREE</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo was alone in the twilight, lying on the old sofa, looking



<P>at the fire, and thinking.&nbsp; It was her favorite way of spending



<P>the hour of dusk.&nbsp; No one disturbed her, and she used to lie



<P>there on Beth's little red pillow, planning stories, dreaming



<P>dreams, or thinking tender thoughts of the sister who never seemed



<P>far away.&nbsp; Her face looked tired, grave, and rather sad, for tomorrow



<P>was her birthday, and she was thinking how fast the years



<P>went by, how old she was getting, and how little she seemed to



<P>have accomplished.&nbsp; Almost twenty-five, and nothing to show for



<P>it.&nbsp; Jo was mistaken in that.&nbsp; There was a good deal to show,



<P>and by-and-by she saw, and was grateful for it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"An old maid, that's what I'm to be.&nbsp; A literary spinster,



<P>with a pen for a spouse, a family of stories for children, and



<P>twenty years hence a morsel of fame, perhaps, when, like poor



<P>Johnson, I'm old and can't enjoy it, solitary, and can't share



<P>it, independent, and don't need it.&nbsp; Well, I needn't be a sour



<P>saint nor a selfish sinner, and, I dare say, old maids are very



<P>comfortable when they get used to it, but..."&nbsp; And there Jo



<P>sighed, as if the prospect was not inviting.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It seldom is, at first, and thirty seems the end of all things



<P>to five-and-twenty.&nbsp; But it's not as bad as it looks, and one can



<P>get on quite happily if one has something in one's self to fall



<P>back upon.&nbsp; At twenty-five, girls begin to talk about being old



<P>maids, but secretly resolve that they never will be.&nbsp; At thirty



<P>they say nothing about it, but quietly accept the fact, and if



<P>sensible, console themselves by remembering that they have twenty



<P>more useful, happy years, in which they may be learning to grow



<P>old gracefully.&nbsp; Don't laugh at the spinsters, dear girls, for



<P>often very tender, tragic romances are hidden away in the hearts



<P>that beat so quietly under the sober gowns, and many silent sacrifices



<P>of youth, health, ambition, love itself, make the faded faces



<P>beautiful in God's sight.&nbsp; Even the sad, sour sisters should



<P>be kindly dealt with, because they have missed the sweetest



<P>part of life, if for no other reason.&nbsp; And looking at them



<P>with compassion, not contempt, girls in their bloom should remember



<P>that they too may miss the blossom time.&nbsp; That rosy cheeks



<P>don't last forever, that silver threads will come in the bonnie



<P>brown hair, and that, by-and-by, kindness and respect will be as



<P>sweet as love and admiration now.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Gentlemen, which means boys, be courteous to the old maids,



<P>no matter how poor and plain and prim, for the only chivalry



<P>worth having is that which is the readiest to pay deference to



<P>the old, protect the feeble, and serve womankind, regardless of



<P>rank, age, or color.&nbsp; Just recollect the good aunts who have not



<P>only lectured and fussed, but nursed and petted, too often without



<P>thanks, the scrapes they have helped you out of, the tips



<P>they have given you from their small store, the stitches the



<P>patient old fingers have set for you, the steps the willing old



<P>feet have taken, and gratefully pay the dear old ladies the little



<P>attentions that women love to receive as long as they live.&nbsp; The



<P>bright-eyed girls are quick to see such traits, and will like you



<P>all the better for them, and if death, almost the only power that



<P>can part mother and son, should rob you of yours, you will be sure



<P>to find a tender welcome and maternal cherishing from some Aunt



<P>Priscilla, who has kept the warmest corner of her lonely old heart



<P>for `the best nevvy in the world'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo must have fallen asleep (as I dare say my reader has during



<P>this little homily), for suddenly Laurie's ghost seemed to



<P>stand before her, a substantial, lifelike ghost, leaning over her



<P>with the very look he used to wear when he felt a good deal and



<P>didn't like to show it.&nbsp; But, like Jenny in the ballad...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She could not think it he,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>and lay staring up at him in startled silence, till he stooped



<P>and kissed her.&nbsp; Then she knew him, and flew up, crying joyfully

.&nbsp; ..

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh my Teddy!&nbsp; Oh my Teddy!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dear Jo, you are glad to see me, then?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Glad!&nbsp; My blessed boy, words can't express my gladness.



<P>Where's Amy?"



<P>"Your mother has got her down at Meg's.&nbsp; We stopped there by



<P>the way, and there was no getting my wife out of their clutches."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your what?" cried Jo, for Laurie uttered those two words



<P>with an unconscious pride and satisfaction which betrayed him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, the dickens!&nbsp; Now I've done it."&nbsp; And he looked so



<P>guilty that Jo was down on him like a flash.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You've gone and got married!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, please, but I never will again."&nbsp; And he went down



<P>upon his knees, with a penitent clasping of hands, and a face



<P>full of mischief, mirth, and triumph.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Actually married?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very much so, thank you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mercy on us.&nbsp; What dreadful thing will you do next?" And



<P>Jo fell into her seat with a gasp.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A characteristic, but not exactly complimentary, congratulation,"



<P>returned Laurie, still in an abject attitude, but beaming



<P>with satisfaction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What can you expect, when you take one's breath away, creeping



<P>in like a burglar, and letting cats out of bags like that? Get



<P>up, you ridiculous boy, and tell me all about it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not a word, unless you let me come in my old place, and



<P>promise not to barricade."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo laughed at that as she had not done for many a long day,



<P>and patted the sofa invitingly, as she said in a cordial tone,



<P>"The old pillow is up garret, and we don't need it now.&nbsp; So, come



<P>and fess, Teddy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How good it sounds to hear you say `Teddy'! No one ever calls



<P>me that but you."&nbsp; And Laurie sat down with an air of great content.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What does Amy call you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My lord."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's like her.&nbsp; Well, you look it."&nbsp; And Jo's eye plainly



<P>betrayed that she found her boy comelier than ever.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The pillow was gone, but there was a barricade, nevertheless,



<P>a natural one, raised by time absence, and change of heart.&nbsp; Both



<P>felt it, and for a minute looked at one another as if that invisible



<P>barrier cast a little shadow over them.&nbsp; It was gone directly



<P>however, for Laurie said, with a vain attempt at dignity...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't I look like a married man and the head of a family?"



<P>"Not a bit, and you never will.&nbsp; You've grown bigger and



<P>bonnier, but you are the same scapegrace as ever."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now really, Jo, you ought to treat me with more respect,"



<P>began Laurie, who enjoyed it all immensely.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How can I, when the mere idea of you, married and settled,



<P>is so irresistibly funny that I can't keep sober!" answered Jo,



<P>smiling all over her face, so infectiously that they had another



<P>laugh, and then settled down for a good talk, quite in the pleasant



<P>old fashion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's no use your going out in the cold to get Amy, for



<P>they are all coming up presently.&nbsp; I couldn't wait.&nbsp; I wanted

to



<P>be the one to tell you the grand surprise, and have `first skim'



<P>as we used to say when we squabbled about the cream."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Of course you did, and spoiled your story by beginning at



<P>the wrong end.&nbsp; Now, start right, and tell me how it all happened.



<P>I'm pining to know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I did it to please Amy," began Laurie, with a twinkle



<P>that made Jo exclaim...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Fib number one.&nbsp; Amy did it to please you.&nbsp; Go on, and tell



<P>the truth, if you can, sir."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now she's beginning to marm it.&nbsp; Isn't it jolly to hear her?"



<P>said Laurie to the fire, and the fire glowed and sparkled as if it



<P>quite agreed.&nbsp; "It's all the same, you know, she and I being one.



<P>We planned to come home with the Carrols, a month or more ago, but



<P>they suddenly changed their minds, and decided to pass another



<P>winter in Paris.&nbsp; But Grandpa wanted to come home.&nbsp; He went

to please



<P>me, and I couldn't let him go along, neither could I leave Amy, and



<P>Mrs. Carrol had got English notions about chaperons and such nonsense,



<P>and wouldn't let Amy come with us.&nbsp; So I just settled the difficulty



<P>by saying, `Let's be married, and then we can do as we like'."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Of course you did.&nbsp; You always have things to suit you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not always."&nbsp; And something in Laurie's voice made Jo say



<P>hastily...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How did you ever get Aunt to agree?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It was hard work, but between us, we talked her over, for we



<P>had heaps of good reasons on our side.&nbsp; There wasn't time to write



<P>and ask leave, but you all liked it, had consented to it by-and-by,



<P>and it was only `taking time by the fetlock', as my wife says."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Aren't we proud of those two word, and don't we like to say



<P>them?" interrupted Jo, addressing the fire in her turn, and watching



<P>with delight the happy light it seemed to kindle in the eyes



<P>that had been so tragically gloomy when she saw them last.



<P>"A trifle, perhaps, she's such a captivating little woman I



<P>can't help being proud of her.&nbsp; Well, then Uncle and Aunt were



<P>there to play propriety.&nbsp; We were so absorbed in one another we



<P>were of no mortal use apart, and that charming arrangement would



<P>make everything easy all round, so we did it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"When, where, how?" asked Jo, in a fever of feminine interest



<P>and curiosity, for she could not realize it a particle.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Six weeks ago, at the American consul's, in Paris, a very



<P>quiet wedding of course, for even in our happiness we didn't forget



<P>dear little Beth."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo put her hand in his as he said that, and Laurie gently



<P>smoothed the little red pillow, which he remembered well.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why didn't you let us know afterward?" asked Jo, in a



<P>quieter tone, when they had sat quite still a minute.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We wanted to surprise you.&nbsp; We thought we were coming



<P>directly home, at first, but the dear old gentleman, as soon as



<P>we were married, found he couldn't be ready under a month, at



<P>least, and sent us off to spend our honeymoon wherever we liked.



<P>Amy had once called Valrosa a regular honeymoon home, so we went



<P>there, and were as happy as people are but once in their lives.



<P>My faith!&nbsp; Wasn't it love among the roses!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie seemed to forget Jo for a minute, and Jo was glad of



<P>it, for the fact that he told her these things so freely and so



<P>naturally assured her that he had quite forgiven and forgotten.



<P>She tried to draw away her hand, but as if he guessed the thought



<P>that prompted the half-involuntary impulse, Laurie held it fast,



<P>and said, with a manly gravity she had never seen in him before...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Jo, dear, I want to say one thing, and then we'll put it by



<P>forever.&nbsp; As I told you in my letter when I wrote that Amy had



<P>been so kind to me, I never shall stop loving you, but the love



<P>is altered, and I have learned to see that it is better as it is.



<P>Amy and you changed places in my heart, that's all.&nbsp; I think it



<P>was meant to be so, and would have come about naturally, if I had



<P>waited, as you tried to make me, but I never could be patient, and



<P>so I got a heartache.&nbsp; I was a boy then, headstrong and violent,



<P>and it took a hard lesson to show me my mistake.&nbsp; For it was one,



<P>Jo, as you said, and I found it out, after making a fool of myself.



<P>Upon my word, I was so tumbled up in my mind, at one time, that I



<P>didn't know which I loved best, you or Amy, and tried to love you



<P>both alike.&nbsp; But I couldn't, and when I saw her in Switzerland,



<P>everything seemed to clear up all at once.&nbsp; You both got into



<P>your right places, and I felt sure that it was well off with the



<P>old love before it was on with the new, that I could honestly



<P>share my heart between sister Jo and wife Amy, and love them dearly.



<P>Will you believe it, and go back to the happy old times when we



<P>first knew one another?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll believe it, with all my heart, but, Teddy, we never can



<P>be boy and girl again.&nbsp; The happy old times can't come back, and

we



<P>mustn't expect it.&nbsp; We are man and woman now, with sober work to

do,



<P>for playtime is over, and we must give up frolicking.&nbsp; I'm sure

you



<P>feel this.&nbsp; I see the change in you, and you'll find it in me.&nbsp;

I



<P>shall miss my boy, but I shall love the man as much, and admire



<P>him more, because he means to be what I hoped he would.&nbsp; We can't



<P>be little playmates any longer, but we will be brother and sister,



<P>to love and help one another all our lives, won't we, Laurie?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He did not say a word, but took the hand she offered him, and



<P>laid his face down on it for a minute, feeling that out of the



<P>grave of a boyish passion, there had risen a beautiful, strong



<P>friendship to bless them both.&nbsp; Presently Jo said cheerfully, for



<P>she didn't the coming home to be a sad one, "I can't make it true



<P>that you children are really married and going to set up housekeeping.



<P>Why, it seems only yesterday that I was buttoning Amy's pinafore,



<P>and pulling your hair when you teased.&nbsp; Mercy me, how time does

fly!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"As one of the children is older than yourself, you needn't



<P>talk so like a grandma.&nbsp; I flatter myself I'm a `gentleman growed'



<P>as Peggotty said of David, and when you see Amy, you'll find her



<P>rather a precocious infant," said Laurie, looking amused at her



<P>maternal air.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You may be a little older in years, but I'm ever so much



<P>older in feeling, Teddy.&nbsp; Women always are, and this last year

has



<P>been such a hard one that I feel forty."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Poor Jo!&nbsp; We left you to bear it alone, while we went pleasuring.



<P>You are older.&nbsp; Here's a line, and there's another.&nbsp; Unless

you smile,



<P>your eyes look sad, and when I touched the cushion, just now,



<P>I found a tear on it.&nbsp; You've had a great deal to bear,



<P>and had to bear it all alone.&nbsp; What a selfish beast I've been!"



<P>And Laurie pulled his own hair, with a remorseful look.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Jo only turned over the traitorous pillow, and answered,



<P>in a tone which she tried to make more cheerful, "No, I had Father



<P>and Mother to help me, and the dear babies to comfort me, and the



<P>thought that you and Amy were safe and happy, to make the troubles



<P>here easier to bear.&nbsp; I am lonely, sometimes, but I dare say it's



<P>good for me, and..."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You never shall be again," broke in Laurie, putting his arm



<P>about her, as if to fence out every human ill.&nbsp; "Amy and I can't



<P>get on without you, so you must come and teach `the children' to



<P>keep house, and go halves in everything, just as we used to do,



<P>and let us pet you, and all be blissfully happy and friendly



<P>together."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If I shouldn't be in the way, it would be very pleasant.&nbsp; I



<P>begin to feel quite young already, for somehow all my troubles



<P>seemed to fly away when you came.&nbsp; You always were a comfort, Teddy."



<P>And Jo leaned her head on his shoulder, just as she did years ago,



<P>when Beth lay ill and Laurie told her to hold on to him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He looked down at her, wondering if she remembered the time,



<P>but Jo was smiling to herself, as if in truth her troubles had



<P>all vanished at his coming.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are the same Jo still, dropping tears about one minute,



<P>and laughing the next.&nbsp; You look a little wicked now.&nbsp; What

is it,



<P>Grandma?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was wondering how you and Amy get on together."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Like angels!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, of course, but which rules?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't mind telling you that she does now, at least I let



<P>her think so, it pleases her, you know.&nbsp; By-and-by we shall take



<P>turns, for marriage, they say, halves one's rights and doubles



<P>one's duties."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You'll go on as you begin, and Amy will rule you all the



<P>days of your life."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, she does it so imperceptibly that I don't think I shall



<P>mind much.&nbsp; She is the sort of woman who knows how to rule well.&nbsp;

In



<P>fact, I rather like it, for she winds one round her finger as softly



<P>and prettily as a skein of silk, and makes you feel as if she was



<P>doing you a favor all the while."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That ever I should live to see you a henpecked husband and



<P>enjoying it!" cried Jo, with uplifted hands.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was good to see Laurie square his shoulders, and smile with



<P>masculine scorn at that insinuation, as he replied, with his "high



<P>and mighty" air, "Amy is too well-bred for that, and I am not the



<P>sort of man to submit to it.&nbsp; My wife and I respect ourselves and



<P>one another too much ever to tyrannize or quarrel."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo like that, and thought the new dignity very becoming, but



<P>the boy seemed changing very fast into the man, and regret mingled



<P>with her pleasure.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am sure of that.&nbsp; Amy and you never did quarrel as we used to.



<P>She is the sun and I the wind, in the fable, and the sun managed



<P>the man best, you remember."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She can blow him up as well as shine on him," laughed Laurie.



<P>"such a lecture as I got at Nice!&nbsp; I give you my word it was a

deal



<P>worse than any or your scoldings, a regular rouser.&nbsp; I'll tell

you



<P>all about it sometime, she never will, because after telling me that



<P>she despised and was ashamed of me, she lost her heart to the despicable



<P>party and married the good-for-nothing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What baseness!&nbsp; Well, if she abuses you, come to me, and I'll



<P>defend you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I look as if I needed it, don't I?" said Laurie, getting up



<P>and striking an attitude which suddenly changed from the imposing



<P>to the rapturous, as Amy's voice was heard calling, "Where is she?



<P>Where's my dear old Jo?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In trooped the whole family, and everyone was hugged and kissed



<P>all over again, and after several vain attempts, the three wanderers



<P>were set down to be looked at and exulted over.&nbsp; Mr. Laurence,

hale



<P>and hearty as ever, was quite as much improved as the others by his



<P>foreign tour, for the crustiness seemed to be nearly gone, and the



<P>old-fashioned courtliness had received a polish which made it kindlier



<P>than ever.&nbsp; It was good to see him beam at `my children', as he



<P>called the young pair.&nbsp; It was better still to see Amy pay him



<P>the daughterly duty and affection which completely won his old heart,



<P>and best of all, to watch Laurie revolve about the two, as if never



<P>tired of enjoying the pretty picture they made.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The minute she put her eyes upon Amy, Meg became conscious that



<P>her own dress hadn't a Parisian air, that young Mrs. Mofffat would be



<P>entirely eclipsed by young Mrs. Laurence, and that `her ladyship' was



<P>altogether a most elegant and graceful woman.&nbsp; Jo thought, as she



<P>watched the pair, "How well they look together!&nbsp; I was right, and



<P>Laurie has found the beautiful, accomplished girl who will become



<P>his home better than clumsy old Jo, and be a pride, not a torment to



<P>him."&nbsp; Mrs. March and her husband smiled and nodded at each other



<P>with happy faces, for they saw that their youngest had done well,



<P>not only in worldly things, but the better wealth of love, confidence,



<P>and happiness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For Amy's face was full of the soft brightness which betokens



<P>a peaceful heart, her voice had a new tenderness in it, and the cool,



<P>prim carriage was changed to a gentle dignity, both womanly and winning.



<P>No little affectations marred it, and the cordial sweetness



<P>of her manner was more charming than the new beauty or the old grace,



<P>for it stamped her at once with the unmistakable sign of the true



<P>gentlewoman she had hoped to become.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Love has done much for our little girl," said her mother softly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She has had a good example before her all her life, my dear,"



<P>Mr. March whispered back, with a loving look at the worn face and gray



<P>head beside him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Daisy found it impossible to keep her eyes off her `pitty aunty',



<P>but attached herself like a lap dog to the wonderful chatelaine full



<P>of delightful charms.&nbsp; Demi paused to consider the new relationship



<P>before he compromised himself by the rash acceptance of a bribe, which



<P>took the tempting form of a family of wooden bears from Berne.&nbsp;

A flank



<P>movement produced an unconditional surrender, however, for Laurie knew



<P>where to have him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Young man, when I first had the honor of making your acquaintance



<P>you hit me in the face.&nbsp; Now I demand the satisfaction of a gentleman,"



<P>and with that the tall uncle proceeded to toss and tousle the small

nephew



<P>in a way that damaged his philosophical dignity as much as it delighted



<P>his boyish soul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Blest if she ain't in silk from head to foot?&nbsp; Ain't it a relishin'



<P>sight to see her settin' there as fine as a fiddle, anch a happy



<P>procession as filed away into the little dining room!&nbsp; Mr. March



<P>proudly escorted Mrs. Laurence.&nbsp; Mrs. March as proudly leaned on



<P>the arm of `my son'.&nbsp; The old gentleman took Jo, with a whispered,



<P>"You must be my girl now," and a glance at the empty corner by the



<P>fire, that made Jo whisper back, "I'll try to fill her place, sir.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The twins pranced behind, feeling that the millennium was at



<P>hand, for everyone was so busy with the newcomers that they were



<P>left to revel at their own sweet will, and you may be sure they



<P>made the most of the opportunity.&nbsp; Didn't they steal sips of tea,



<P>stuff gingerbread ad libitum, get a hot biscuit apiece, and as a



<P>crowning trespass, didn't they each whisk a captivating little tart



<P>into their tiny pockets, there to stick and crumble treacherously,



<P>teaching them that both human nature and a pastry are frail?



<P>Burdened with the guilty consciousness of the sequestered tarts,



<P>and fearing that Dodo's sharp eyes would pierce the thin disguise of



<P>cambric and merino which hid their booty, the little sinners



<P>attached themselves to `Dranpa', who hadn't his spectacles on.&nbsp;

Amy,



<P>who was handed about like refreshments, returned to the parlor on



<P>Father Laurence's arm.&nbsp; The others paired off as before, and this



<P>arrangement left Jo companionless.&nbsp; She did not mind it at the



<P>minute, for she lingered to answer Hannah's eager inquiry.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Will Miss Amy ride in her coop (coupe), and use all them



<P>lovely silver dishes that's stored away over yander?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Shouldn't wonder if she drove six white horses, ate off gold



<P>plate, and wore diamonds and point lace every day.&nbsp; Teddy thinks



<P>nothing too good for her," returned Jo with infinite satisfaction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No more there is!&nbsp; Will you have hash or fishballs for breakfast?"



<P>asked Hannah, who wisely mingled poetry and prose.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't care."&nbsp; And Jo shut the door, feeling that food was an



<P>uncongenial topic just then.&nbsp; She stood a minute looking at the



<P>party vanishing above, and as Demi's short plaid legs toiled up the



<P>last stair, a sudden sense of lonliness came over her so strongly



<P>that she looked about her with dim eyes, as if to find something to



<P>lean upon, for even Teddy had deserted her.&nbsp; If she had known what



<P>birthday gift was coming every minute nearer and nearer, she would



<P>not have said to herself, "I'll weep a little weep when I go to bed.



<P>It won't do to be dismal now."&nbsp; Then she drew her hand over her

eyes,



<P>for one of her boyish habits was never to know where her



<P>handkerchief was, and had just managed to call up a smile when



<P>there came a knock at the porch door.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She opened with hospitable haste, and started as if another



<P>ghost had come to surprise her, for there stood a tall bearded



<P>gentleman, beaming on her from the darkness like a midnight sun.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, Mr. Bhaer, I am so glad to see you!" cried Jo, with a



<P>clutch, as if she feared the night would swallow him up before



<P>she could get him in.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And I to see Miss Marsch, but no, you haf a party," and the



<P>Professor paused as the sound of voices and the tap of dancing



<P>feet came down to them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, we haven't, only the family.&nbsp; My sister and friends



<P>have just come home, and we are all very happy.&nbsp; Come in, and



<P>make one of us."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Though a very social man, I think Mr. Bhaer would have gone



<P>decorously away, and come again another day, but how could he,



<P>when Jo shut the door behind him, and bereft him of his hat?



<P>Perhaps her face had something to do with it, for she forgot



<P>to hide her joy at seeing him, and showed it with a frankness



<P>that proved irresistible to the solitary man, whose welcome far



<P>exceeded his boldest hopes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If I shall not be Monsieur de Trop, I will so gladly see



<P>them all.&nbsp; You haf been ill, my friend?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He put the question abruptly, for, as Jo hung up his coat,



<P>the light fell on her face, and he saw a change in it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not ill, but tired and sorrowful.&nbsp; We have had trouble



<P>since I saw you last."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, yes, I know.&nbsp; My heart was sore for you when I heard



<P>that," And he shook hands again, with such a sympathetic face



<P>that Jo felt as if no comfort could equal the look of the kind



<P>eyes, the grasp of the big, warm hand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Father, Mother, this is my friend, Professor Bhaer," she



<P>said, with a face and tone of such irrepressible pride and



<P>pleasure that she might as well have blown a trumpet and opened



<P>the door with a flourish.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If the stranger had any doubts about his reception, they



<P>were set at rest in a minute by the cordial welcome he received.



<P>Everyone greeted him kindly, for Jo's sake at first, but very



<P>soon they liked him for his own.&nbsp; They could not help it, for



<P>he carried the talisman that opens all hearts, and these simple



<P>people warmed to him at once, feeling even the more friendly



<P>because he was poor.&nbsp; For poverty enriches those who live above



<P>it, and is a sure passport to truly hospitable spirits.&nbsp; Mr.



<P>Bhaer sat looking about him with the air of a traveler who



<P>knocks at a strange door, and when it opens, finds himself at



<P>home.&nbsp; The children went to him like bees to a honeypot, and



<P>establishing themselves on each knee, proceeded to captivate him



<P>by rifling his pockets, pulling his beard, and investigating his



<P>watch, with juvenile audacity.&nbsp; The women telegraphed their



<P>approval to one another, and Mr. March, feeling that he had got



<P>a kindred spirit, opened his choicest stores for his guest's



<P>benefit, while silent John listened and enjoyed the talk, but



<P>said not a word, and Mr. Laurence found it impossible to go to



<P>sleep.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If Jo had not been otherwise engaged, Laurie's behavior



<P>would have amused her, for a faint twinge, not of jealousy, but



<P>something like suspicion, caused that gentleman to stand aloof



<P>at first, and observe the newcomer with brotherly circumspection.



<P>But it did not last long.&nbsp; He got interested in spite of himself,



<P>and before he knew it, was drawn into the circle.&nbsp; For Mr. Bhaer



<P>talked well in this genial atmosphere, and did himself justice.



<P>He seldom spoke to Laurie, but he looked at him often, and a



<P>shadow would pass across his face, as if regretting his own lost



<P>youth, as he watched the young man in his prime.&nbsp; Then his eyes



<P>would turn to Jo so wistfully that she would have surely answered



<P>the mute inquiry if she had seen it.&nbsp; But Jo had her own eyes to



<P>take care of, and feeling that they could not be trusted, she



<P>prudently kept them on the little sock she was knitting, like a



<P>model maiden aunt.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A stealthy glance now and then refreshed her like sips of



<P>fresh water after a dusty walk, for the sidelong peeps showed



<P>her several propitious omens.&nbsp; Mr. Bhaer's face had lost the



<P>absent-minded expression, and looked all alive with interest in



<P>the present moment, actually young and handsome, she thought,



<P>forgetting to compare him with Laurie, as she usually did strange



<P>men, to their great detriment.&nbsp; Then he seemed quite inspired,



<P>though the burial customs of the ancients, to which the conversation



<P>had strayed, might not be considered an exhilarating topic.



<P>Jo quite glowed with triumph when Teddy got quenched in



<P>an argument, and thought to herself, as she watched her father's



<P>absorbed face, "How he would enjoy having such a man as my Professor



<P>to talk with every day!"&nbsp; Lastly, Mr. Bhaer was dressed



<P>in a new suit of black, which made him look more like a gentleman



<P>than ever.&nbsp; His bushy hair had been cut and smoothly brushed, but



<P>didn't stay in order long, for in exciting moments, he rumpled



<P>it up in the droll way he used to do, and Jo liked it rampantly



<P>erect better than flat, because she thought it gave his fine



<P>forehead a Jove-like aspect.&nbsp; Poor Jo, how she did glorify that



<P>plain man, as she sat knitting away so quietly, yet letting



<P>nothing escape her, not even the fact that Mr. Bhaer actually



<P>had gold sleeve-buttons in his immaculate wristbands.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dear old fellow!&nbsp; He couldn't have got himself up with



<P>more care if he'd been going a-wooing," said Jo to herself, and



<P>then a sudden thought born of the words made her blush so dreadfully



<P>that she had to drop her ball, and go down after it to hide her face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The maneuver did not succeed as well as she expected, however,



<P>for though just in the act of setting fire to a funeral



<P>pyre, the Professor dropped his torch, metaphorically speaking,



<P>and made a dive after the little blue ball.&nbsp; Of course they



<P>bumped their heads smartly together, saw stars, and both came



<P>up flushed and laughing, without the ball, to resume their seats,



<P>wishing they had not left them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nobody knew where the evening went to, for Hannah skillfully



<P>abstracted the babies at an early hour, nodding like two rosy



<P>poppies, and Mr. Laurence went home to rest.&nbsp; The others sat



<P>round the fire, talking away, utterly regardless of the lapse



<P>of time, till Meg, whose maternal was impressed with a firm conviction



<P>that Daisy had tumbled out of be, and Demi set his nightgown



<P>afire studying the structure of matches, made a move to go.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We must have our sing, in the good old way, for we are all



<P>together again once more," said Jo, feeling that a good shout



<P>would be a safe and pleasant vent for the jubilant emotions of



<P>her soul.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They were not all there.&nbsp; But no one found the words thougtless



<P>or untrue, for Beth still seemed among them, a peaceful presence,



<P>invisible, but dearer than ever, since death could not break



<P>the household league that love made disoluble.&nbsp; The little



<P>chair stood in its old place.&nbsp; The tidy basket, with the bit of



<P>work she left unfinished when the needle grew `so heavy', was



<P>still on its accustomed shelf.&nbsp; The beloved instrument, seldom



<P>touched now had not been moved, and above it Beth's face, serene



<P>and smiling, as in the early days, looked down upon them, seeming



<P>to say, "Be happy.&nbsp; I am here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Play something, Amy.&nbsp; Let them hear how much you have improved,"



<P>said Laurie, with pardonable pride in his promising pupil.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Amy whispered, with full eyes, as she twirled the faded



<P>stool, "Not tonight, dear.&nbsp; I can't show off tonight."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But she did show something better than brilliancy or skill,



<P>for she sang Beth's songs with a tender music in her voice which



<P>the best master could not have taught, and touched the listener's



<P>hearts with a sweeter power than any other inspiration could have



<P>given her.&nbsp; The room was very still, when the clear voice failed



<P>suddenly at the last line of Beth's favorite hymn.&nbsp; It was hard



<P>to say...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Earth hath no sorrow that heaven cannot heal;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>and Amy leaned against her husband, who stood behind her, feeling



<P>that her welcome home was not quite perfect without Beth's kiss.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now, we must finish with Mignon's song, for Mr. Bhaer sings



<P>that," said Jo, before the pause grew painful.&nbsp; And Mr. Bhaer



<P>cleared his throat with a gratified "Hem!" as he stepped into the



<P>corner where Jo stood, saying...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You will sing with me?&nbsp; We go excellently well together."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A pleasing fiction, by the way, for Jo had no more idea of



<P>music than a grasshopper.&nbsp; But she would have consented if he had



<P>proposed to sing a whole opera, and warbled away, blissfully regardless



<P>of time and tune.&nbsp; It didn't much matter, for Mr. Bhaer



<P>sang like a true German, heartily and well, and Jo soon subsided



<P>into a subdued hum, that she might listen to the mellow voice that



<P>seemed to sing for her alone.



<P>Know'st thou the land where the citron blooms,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>used to be the Professor's favorite line, for `das land' meant



<P>Germany to him, but now he seemed to dwell, with peculiar warmth



<P>and melody, upon the words...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There, oh there, might I with thee,



<P>O, my beloved, go

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>and one listener was so thrilled by the tender invitation that she



<P>longed to say she did know the land, and would joyfully depart



<P>thither whenever he liked



<P>The song was considered a great success, and the singer retired



<P>covered with laurels.&nbsp; But a few minutes afterward, he forgot his



<P>manners entirely, and stared at Amy putting on her bonnet, for she



<P>had been introduced simply as `my sister', and on one had called



<P>her by her new name since her came.&nbsp; He forgot himself still further



<P>when Laurie said, in his most gracious manner, at parting...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My wife and I are very glad to meet you, sir.&nbsp; Please remember



<P>that there is always a welcome waiting for you over the way."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then the Professor thanked him so heartily, and looked so



<P>suddenly illuminated with satisfaction, that Laurie thought him



<P>the most delightfully demonstrative old fellow he ever met.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I too shall go, but I shall gladly come again, if you will



<P>gif me leave, dear madame, for a little business in the city will



<P>keep me here some days."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He spoke to Mrs. March, but he looked at Jo, and the mother's



<P>voice gave as cordial an assent as did the daughter's eyes, for



<P>Mrs. March was not so blind to her children's interest as Mrs.



<P>Moffat supposed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I suspect that is a wise man," remarked Mr. March, with



<P>placid satisfaction, from the hearthrug, after the last guest had



<P>gone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I know he is a good one," added Mrs. March, with decided



<P>approval, as she wound up the clock.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I thought you'd like him," was all Jo said, as she slipped



<P>away to her bed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She wondered what the business was that brought Mr. Bhaer to



<P>the city, and finally decided that he had been appointed to some



<P>great honor, somewhere, but had been too modest to mention the



<P>fact.&nbsp; If she had seen his face when, safe in his own room, he



<P>looked at the picture of a severe and rigid young lady, with a



<P>good deal of hair, who appeared to be gazing darkly into futurity,



<P>it might have thrown some light upon the subject, especially when



<P>he turned off the gas, and kissed the picture in the dark.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was easy to promise self-abnegation when self was



<P>wrapped up in another, and heart and soul were purified by a



<P>sweet example.&nbsp; But when the helpful voice was silent, the



<P>daily lesson over, the beloved presence gone, and nothing remained



<P>but lonliness and grief, then Jo found her promise very



<P>hard to keep.&nbsp; How could she `comfort Father and Mother' when



<P>her own heart ached with a ceaseless longing for her sister,



<P>how could she `make the house cheerful' when all its light and



<P>warmth and beauty seemed to have deserted it when Beth left the



<P>old home for the new, and where in all the world could she `find



<P>some useful, happy work to do', that would take the place of the



<P>loving service which had been its own reward?&nbsp; She tried in a



<P>blind, hopeless way to do her duty, secretly rebelling against



<P>it all the while, for it seemed unjust that her few joys should



<P>be lessened, her burdens made heavier, and life get harder and



<P>harder as she toiled along.&nbsp; Some people seemed to get all sunshine,



<P>and some all shadow.&nbsp; It was not fair, for she tried more



<P>than Amy to be good, but never got any reward, only disappointment,



<P>trouble and hard work.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Poor Jo, these were dark days to her, for something like



<P>despair came over her when she thought of spending all her life



<P>in that quiet house, devoted to humdrum cares, a few small pleasures,



<P>and the duty that never seemed to grow any easier.&nbsp; "I can't do

it.



<P>I wasn't meant for a life like this, and I know I shall break away



<P>and do something desperate if somebody doesn't come and help me,"



<P>she said to herself, when her first efforts failed and she fell



<P>into the moody, miserable state of mind which often comes when



<P>strong wills have to yield to the inevitable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But someone did come and help her, though Jo did not recognize



<P>her good angels at once because they wore familiar shapes and used



<P>the simple spells best fitted to poor humanity.&nbsp; Often she started



<P>up at night, thinking Beth called her, and when the sight of the



<P>little empty bed made her cry with the bitter cry of unsubmissive



<P>sorrow, "Oh, Beth, come back!&nbsp; Come back!" she did not stretch

out



<P>her yearning arms in vain.&nbsp; For, as quick to hear her sobbing as



<P>she had been to hear her sister's faintest whisper, her mother came



<P>to comfort her, not with words only, but the patient tenderness



<P>that soothes by a touch, tears that were mute reminders of a greater



<P>grief than Jo's, and broken whispers, more eloquent than prayers,



<P>because hopeful resignation went hand-in-hand with natural sorrow.



<P>Sacred moments, when heart talked to heart in the silence of the



<P>night, turning affliction to a blessing, which chastened grief and



<P>strengthned love.&nbsp; Feeling this, Jo's burden seemed easier to bear,



<P>duty grew sweeter, and life looked more endurable, seen from the



<P>safe shelter of her mother's arms.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When aching heart was a little comforted, troubled mind likewise



<P>found help, for one day she went to the study, and leaning



<P>over the good gray head lifted to welcome her with a tranquil smile,



<P>she said very humbly, "Father, talk to me as you did to Beth.&nbsp;

I



<P>need it more than she did, for I'm all wrong."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear, nothing can comfort me like this," he answered,



<P>with a falter in his voice, and both arms round her, as if he too,



<P>needed help, and did not fear to ask for it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then, sitting in Beth's little chair close beside him, Jo told



<P>her troubles, the resentful sorrow for her loss, the fruitless



<P>efforts that discouraged her, the want of faith that made life look



<P>so dark, and all the sad bewilderment which we call despair.&nbsp; She



<P>gave him entire confidence, he gave her the help she needed, and



<P>both found consolation in the act.&nbsp; For the time had come when

they



<P>could talk together not only as father and daughter, but as man and



<P>woman, able and glad to serve each other with mutual sympathy as well



<P>as mutual love.&nbsp; Happy, thoughtful times there in the old study

which



<P>Jo called `the church of one member', and from which she came with



<P>fresh courage, recovered cheerfulness, and a more submissive spirit.



<P>For the parents who had taught one child to meet death without fear,



<P>were trying now to teach another to accept life without despondency



<P>or distrust, and to use its beautiful opportunities with gratitude



<P>and power.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Other helps had Jo--humble, wholesome duties and delights that



<P>would not be denied their part in serving her, and which she slowly



<P>learned to see and value.&nbsp; Brooms and dishcloths never could



<P>be as distasteful as they once had been, for Beth had presided



<P>over both, and something of her housewifely spirit seemed to



<P>linger around the little mop and the old brush, never thrown



<P>away.&nbsp; As she used them, Jo found herself humming the songs



<P>Beth used to hum, imitating Beth's orderly ways, and giving the



<P>little touches here and there that kept everything fresh and



<P>cozy, which was the first step toward making home happy, though



<P>she didn't know it till Hannah said with an approving squeeze



<P>of the hand...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You thoughtful creeter, you're determined we shan't miss



<P>that dear lamb ef you can help it.&nbsp; We don't say much, but we



<P>see it, and the Lord will bless you for't, see ef He don't."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As they sat sewing together, Jo discovered how much improved



<P>her sister Meg was, how well she could talk, how much she knew



<P>about good, womanly impulses, thoughts, and feelings, how happy



<P>she was in husband and children, and how much they were all doing



<P>for each other.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Marriage is an excellent thing, after all.&nbsp; I wonder if I



<P>should blossom out half as well as you have, if I tried it?" said



<P>Jo, as she constructed a kite for Demi in the topsy-turvy nursery.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's just what you need to bring out the tender womanly half



<P>of your nature, Jo.&nbsp; You are like a chestnut burr, prickly outside,



<P>but silky-soft within, and a sweet kernal, if one can only get at



<P>it.&nbsp; Love will make you show your heart one day, and then the rough



<P>burr will fall off."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Frost opens chestnut burrs, ma`am, and it takes a good shake



<P>to bring them down.&nbsp; Boys go nutting, and I don't care to be bagged



<P>by them," returned Jo, pasting away at the kite which no wind that



<P>blows would ever carry up, for Daisy had tied herself on as a bob.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg laughed, for she was glad to see a glimmer of Jo's old



<P>spirit, but she felt it her duty to enforce her opinion by every



<P>argument in her power, and the sisterly chats were not wasted, especially



<P>as two of Meg's most effective arguments were the babies,



<P>whom Jo loved tenderly.&nbsp; Grief is the best opener of some hearts,



<P>and Jo's was nearly ready for the bag.&nbsp; A little more sunshine

to



<P>ripen the nut, then, not a boy's impatient shake, but a man's hand



<P>reached up to pick it gently from the burr, and find the kernal



<P>sound and sweet.&nbsp; If she suspected this, she would have shut up



<P>tight, and been more prickly than ever, fortunately she wasn't



<P>thinking about herself, so when the time came, down she dropped.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, if she had been the heroine of a moral storybook, she



<P>ought at this period of her life to have become quite saintly,



<P>renounced the world, and gone about doing good in a mortified



<P>bonnet, with tracts in her pocket.&nbsp; But, you see, Jo wasn't a



<P>heroine, she was only a struggling human girl like hundreds of



<P>others, and she just acted out her nature, being sad, cross, listless,



<P>or energetic, as the mood suggested.&nbsp; It's highly virtuous



<P>to say we'll be good, but we can't do it all at once, and it takes



<P>a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull all together before some



<P>of us even get our feet set in the right way.&nbsp; Jo had got so far,



<P>she was learning to do her duty, and to feel unhappy if she did



<P>not, but to do it cheerfully, ah, that was another thing!&nbsp; She



<P>had often said she wanted to do something splendid, no matter how



<P>hard, and now she had her wish, for what could be more beautiful



<P>than to devote her life to Father and Mother, trying to make home



<P>as happy to them as they had to her?&nbsp; And if difficulties were



<P>necessary to increase the splendor of the effort, what could be



<P>harder for a restless, ambitious girl than to give up her own



<P>hopes, plans, and desires, and cheerfully live for others?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Providence had taken her at her word.&nbsp; Here was the task, not



<P>what she had expected, but better because self had no part in it.



<P>Now, could she do it?&nbsp; She decided that she would try, and in her



<P>first attempt she found the helps I have suggested.&nbsp; Still another



<P>was given her, and she took it, not as a reward, but as a comfort,



<P>as Christian took the refreshment afforded by the little arbor



<P>where he rested, as he climbed the hill called Difficulty.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why don't you write?&nbsp; That always used to make you happy,"



<P>said her mother once, when the desponding fit over-shadowed Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I've no heart to write, and if I had, nobody cares for my



<P>things."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We do.&nbsp; Write something for us, and never mind the rest of



<P>the world.&nbsp; Try it, dear.&nbsp; I'm sure it would do you good,

and



<P>please us very much."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't believe I can."&nbsp; But Jo got out her desk and began to



<P>overhaul her half-finished manuscripts.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>An hour afterward her mother peeped in and there she was,



<P>scratching away, with her black pinafore on, and an absorbed expression,



<P>which caused Mrs. March to smile and slip away, well pleased



<P>with the success of her suggestion.&nbsp; Jo never knew how it



<P>happened, but something got into that story that went straight to



<P>the hearts of those who read it, for when her family had laughed



<P>and cried over it, her father sent it, much against her will, to



<P>one of the popular magazines, and to her utter surprise, it was



<P>not only paid for, but others requested.&nbsp; Letters from several



<P>persons, whose praise was honor, followed the appearance of the



<P>little story, newspapers copied it, and strangers as well as friends,



<P>admired it.&nbsp; For a small thing it was a great success, and Jo was



<P>more astonished than when her novel was commended and condemned



<P>all at once.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't understand it.&nbsp; What can there be in a simple little



<P>story like that to make people praise it so?" she said, quite bewildered.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is truth in it, Jo, that's the secret.&nbsp; Humor and pathos



<P>make it alive, and you have found your style at last.&nbsp; You wrote



<P>with not thoughts of fame and money, and put your heart into it,



<P>my daughter.&nbsp; You have had the bitter, now comes the sweet.&nbsp;

Do



<P>your best, and grow as happy as we are in your success."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If there is anything good or true in what I write, it isn't



<P>mine.&nbsp; I owe it all to you and Mother and Beth," said Jo, more



<P>touched by her father's words than by any amount of praise from



<P>the world.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So taught by love and sorrow, Jo wrote her little stories,



<P>and sent them away to make friends for themselves and her, finding



<P>it a very charitable world to such humble wanderers, for they were



<P>kindly welcomed, and sent home comfortable tokens to their mother,



<P>like dutiful children whom good fortune overtakes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Amy and Laurie wrote of their engagement, Mrs. March



<P>feared that Jo would find it difficult to rejoice over it, but



<P>her fears were soon set at rest, for thought Jo looked grave at



<P>first, she took it very quietly, and was full of hopes and plans



<P>for `the children' before she read the letter twice.&nbsp; It was a



<P>sort of written duet, wherein each glorified the other in loverlike



<P>fashion, very pleasant to read and satisfactory to think of,



<P>for no one had any objection to make.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You like it, Mother?" said Jo, as they laid down the closely



<P>written sheets and looked at one another.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, I hoped it would be so, ever since Amy wrote that she



<P>had refused Fred.&nbsp; I felt sure then that something better than



<P>what you call the `mercenary spirit' had come over her, and a



<P>hint here and there in her letters made me suspect that love



<P>and Laurie would win the day."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How sharp you are, Marmee, and how silent!&nbsp; You never said



<P>a worked to me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mothers have need of sharp eyes and discreet tongues when



<P>they have girls to manage.&nbsp; I was half afraid to put the idea



<P>into your head, lest you should write and congratulate them before



<P>the thing was settled."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm not the scatterbrain I was.&nbsp; You may trust me.&nbsp; I'm



<P>sober and sensible enough for anyone's confidante now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So you are, my dear, and I should have made you mine,



<P>only I fancied it might pain you to learn that your Teddy loved



<P>someone else."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now, Mother, did you really think I could be so silly and



<P>selfish, after I'd refused his love, when it was freshest, if not



<P>best?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I knew you were sincere then, Jo, but lately I have thought



<P>that if he came back, and asked again, you might perhaps, feel like



<P>giving another answer.&nbsp; Forgive me, dear, I can't help seeing that



<P>you are very lonely, and sometimes there is a hungry look in your



<P>eyes that goes to my heart.&nbsp; So I fancied that your boy might fill



<P>the empty place if he tried now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, Mother, it is better as it ia, and I'm glad Amy has learned



<P>to love him.&nbsp; But you are right in one thing.&nbsp; I am lonely,

and perhaps



<P>if Teddy had tried again, I might have said `Yes', not because



<P>I love him any more, but because I care more to be loved than when



<P>he went away."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm glad of that, Jo, for it shows that you are getting on.



<P>There are plenty to love you, so try to be satisfied with Father



<P>and Mother, sisters and brothers, friends and babies, till the



<P>best lover of all comes to give you your reward."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mothers are the best lovers in the world, but I don't mind



<P>whispering to Marmee that I'd like to try all kinds.&nbsp; It's very



<P>curious, but the more I try to satisfy myself with all sorts of



<P>natural affections, the more I seem to want.&nbsp; I'd no idea hearts



<P>could take in so many.&nbsp; Mine is so elastic, it never seems full



<P>now, and I used to be quite contented with my family.&nbsp; I don't



<P>understand it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do."&nbsp; And Mrs. March smiled her wise smile, as Jo turned



<P>back the leaves to read what Amy said of Laurie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is so beautiful to be loved as Laurie loves me.&nbsp; He isn't



<P>sentimental, doesn't say much about it, but I see and feel it in



<P>all he says and does, and it makes me so happy and so humble that



<P>I don't seem to be the same girl I was.&nbsp; I never knew how good

and



<P>generous and tender he was till now, for he lets me read his heart,



<P>and I find it full of noble impulses and hopes and purposes, and



<P>am so proud to know it's mine.&nbsp; He says he feels as if he `could



<P>make a prosperous voyage now with me aboard as mate, and lots of



<P>love for ballast'.&nbsp; I pray he may, and try to be all he believes



<P>me, for I love my gallant captain with all my heart and soul and



<P>might, and never will desert him, while God lets us be together.



<P>Oh, Mother, I never knew how much like heaven this world could be,



<P>when two people love and live for one another!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And that's our cool, reserved, and worldly Amy!&nbsp; Truly, love



<P>does work miracles.&nbsp; How very, very happy they must be!"&nbsp;

And Jo



<P>laid the rustling sheets together with a careful hand, as one



<P>might shut the covers of a lovely romance, which holds the reader



<P>fast till the end comes, and he finds himself alone in the workaday



<P>world again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>By-and-by Jo roamed away upstairs, for it was rainy, and she



<P>could not walk.&nbsp; A restless spirit possessed her, and the old



<P>feeling came again, not bitter as it once was, but a sorrowfully



<P>patient wonder why one sister should have all she asked, the other



<P>nothing.&nbsp; It was not true, she knew that and tried to put it away,



<P>but the natural craving for affection was strong, and Amy's happiness



<P>woke the hungry longing for someone to `love with heart



<P>and soul, and cling to while God let them be together'.



<P>Up in the garret, where Jo's unquiet wanderings ended stood



<P>four little wooden chests in a row, each marked with its owners



<P>name, and each filled with relics of the childhood and girlhood



<P>ended now for all.&nbsp; Jo glanced into them, and when she came to



<P>her own, leaned her chin on the edge, and stared absently at the



<P>chaotic collection, till a bundle of old exercise books caught



<P>her eye.&nbsp; She drew them out, turned them over, and relived that



<P>pleasant winter at kind Mrs. Kirke's.&nbsp; She had smiled at first,



<P>then she looked thoughtful, next sad, and when she came to a



<P>little message written in the Professor's hand, her lips began



<P>to tremble, the books slid out of her lap, and she sat looking



<P>at the friendly words, as they took a new meaning, and touched



<P>a tender spot in her heart.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Wait for me, my friend.&nbsp; I may be a little late, but I shall



<P>surely come."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, if he only would!&nbsp; So kine, so good, so patient with me



<P>always, my dear old Fritz.&nbsp; I didn't value him half enough when

I



<P>had him, but now how I should love to see him, for everyone seems



<P>going away from me, and I'm all alone."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And holding the little paper fast, as if it were a promise



<P>yet to be fulfilled, Jo laid her head down on a comfortable rag



<P>bag, and cried, as if in opposition to the rain pattering on the



<P>roof.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Was it all self-pity, loneliness, or low spirits?&nbsp; Or was it



<P>the waking up of a sentiment which had bided its time as patiently



<P>as its inspirer?&nbsp; Who shall say?

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While Laurie and Amy were taking conjugal strolls over velvet



<P>carpets, as they set their house in order, and planned a blissful



<P>future, Mr. Bhaer and Jo were enjoying promenades of a different



<P>sort, along muddy roads and sodden fields.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I always do take a walk toward evening, and I don't know



<P>why I should give it up, just because I happen to meet the Professor



<P>on his way out," said Jo to herself, after two or three



<P>encounters, for though there were two paths to Meg's whichever



<P>one she took she was sure to meet him., either going or returning.



<P>He was always walking rapidly, and never seemed to see her



<P>until quite close, when he would look as if his short-sighted



<P>eyes had failed to recognize the approaching lady till that



<P>moment.&nbsp; Then, if she was going to Meg's he always had something



<P>for the babies.&nbsp; If her face was turned homeward, he had merely



<P>strolled down to see the river, and was just returning, unless



<P>they were tired of his frequent calls.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Under the circumstances, what could Jo do but greet him



<P>civilly, and invite him in?&nbsp; If she was tired of his visits, she



<P>concealed her weariness with perfect skill, and took care that



<P>there should be coffee for supper, "as Friedrich--I mean Mr.



<P>Bhaer--doesn't like tea."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>By the second week, everyone knew perfectly well what was



<P>going on, yet everyone tried to look as if they were stone-blind



<P>to the changes in Jo's face.&nbsp; They never asked why she sang about



<P>her work, did up her hair three times a day, and got so blooming



<P>with her evening exercise.&nbsp; And no one seemed to have the slightest



<P>suspicion that Professor Bhaer, while talking philosophy with



<P>the father, was giving the daughter lessons in love.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo couldn't even lose her heart in a decorous manner, but



<P>sternly tried to quench her feelings, and failing to do so, led



<P>a somewhat agitated life.&nbsp; She was mortally afraid of being laughed



<P>at for surrendering, after her many and vehement declarations of



<P>independence.&nbsp; Laurie was her especial dread, but thanks to the



<P>new manager, he behaved with praiseworthy propriety, never called



<P>Mr. Bhaer `a capital old fellow' in public, never alluded, in the



<P>remotest manner, to Jo's improved appearance, or expressed the



<P>least surprise at seeing the Professor's hat on the Marches' table



<P>nearly every evening.&nbsp; But he exulted in private and longed for



<P>the time to come when he could give Jo a piece of plate, with a



<P>bear and a ragged staff on it as an appropriate coat of arms.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For a fortnight, the Professor came and went with lover-like



<P>regularity.&nbsp; Then he stayed away for three whole days, and made



<P>no sign, a proceeding which caused everybody to look sober, and



<P>Jo to become pensive, at first, and then--alas for romance--very



<P>cross.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Disgusted, I dare say, and gone home as suddenly as he came.



<P>It's nothing tome, of course, but I should think he would have



<P>come and bid us goodbye like a gentleman," she said to herself,



<P>with a despairing look at the gate, as she put on her things for



<P>the customary walk one dull afternoon.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You'd better take the little umbrella, dear.&nbsp; It looks like



<P>rain," said her mother, observing that she had on her new bonnet,



<P>but not alluding to the fact.



<P>"Yes, Marmee, do you want anything in town?&nbsp; I've got to



<P>run in and get some paper," returned Jo, pulling out the bow



<P>under her chin before the glass as an excuse for not looking at



<P>her mother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, I want some twilled silesia, a paper of number nine



<P>needles, and two yards of narrow lavender ribbon.&nbsp; Have you got



<P>your thick boots on, and something warm under your cloak?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I believe so," answered Jo absently.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If you happen to meet Mr. Bhaer, bring him home to tea.



<P>I quite long to see the dear man," added Mrs. March.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo heard that, but made no answer, except to kiss her mother,



<P>and walk rapidly away, thinking with a glow of gratitude, in spite



<P>of her heartache, "How good she is to me! What do girls do who



<P>haven't any mothers to help them through their troubles?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The dry-goods stores were not down among the counting-houses,



<P>banks, and wholesale warerooms, where gentlemen most do congregate,



<P>but Jo found herself in that part of the city before she did a



<P>single errand, loitering along as if waiting for someone, examining



<P>engineering instruments in one window and samples of wool in



<P>another, with most unfeminine interest, tumbling over barrels,



<P>being half-smothered by descending bales, and hustled unceremoniously



<P>by busy men who looked as if they wondered `how the deuce



<P>she got there'.&nbsp; A drop of rain on her cheek recalled her thoughts



<P>from baffled hopes to ruined ribbons.&nbsp; For the drops continued

to



<P>fall, and being a woman as well as a lover, she felt that, though



<P>it was too late to save her heart, she might her bonnet.&nbsp; Now she



<P>remembered the little umbrella, which she had forgotten to take



<P>in her hurry to be off, but regret was unavailing, and nothing



<P>could be done but borrow one or submit to to a drenching.&nbsp; She



<P>looked up at the lowering sky, down at the crimson bow already



<P>flecked with black, forward along the muddy street, then one



<P>long, lingering look behind, at a certain grimy warehouse, with



<P>`Hoffmann, Swartz, &amp; Co.' over the door, and said to herself,



<P>with a sternly reproachful air...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It serves me right! what business had I to put on all my



<P>best things and come philandering down here, hoping to see the



<P>Professor?&nbsp; Jo, I'm ashamed of you!&nbsp; No, you shall not go

there



<P>to borrow an umbrella, or find out where he is, from his friends.



<P>You shall trudge away, and do your errands in the rain, and if



<P>you catch your death and ruin your bonnet, it's no more than



<P>you deserve.&nbsp; Now then!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With that she rushed across the street so impetuously that she



<P>narrowly escaped annihilation from a passing truck, and precipitated



<P>herself into the arms of a stately old gentleman, who said,



<P>"I beg pardon, ma'am," and looked mortally offended.&nbsp; Somewhat



<P>daunted, Jo righted herself, spread her handkerchief over



<P>the devoted ribbons, and putting temptation behind her, hurried on,



<P>with increasing dampness about the ankles, and much clashing of



<P>umbrellas overhead.&nbsp; The fact that a somewhat dilapidated blue



<P>one remained stationary above the unprotected bonnet attracted



<P>her attention, and looking up, she saw Mr. Bhaer looking down.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I feel to know the strong-minded lady who goes so bravely



<P>under many horse noses, and so fast through much mus.&nbsp; What do



<P>you down here, my friend?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm shopping."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Bhaer smiled, as he glanced from the pickle factory on



<P>one side to the wholesale hide and leather concern on the other,



<P>but her only said politely, "You haf no umbrella.&nbsp; May I go also,



<P>and take for you the bundles?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, thank you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo's cheeks were as red as her ribbon, and she wondered what



<P>he thought of her, but she didn't care, for in a minute she found



<P>herself walking away arm in arm with her Professor, feeling as if



<P>the sun had suddenly burst out with uncommon brilliancy, that



<P>the world was all right again, and that one thoroughly happy woman



<P>was paddling through the wet that day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We thought you had gone," said Jo hastily, for she knew he



<P>was looking at her.&nbsp; Her bonnet wasn't big enough to hide her face,



<P>and she feared he might think the joy it betrayed unmaidenly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Did you believe that I should go with no farewell to those



<P>who haf been so heavenly kind tome?" he asked so reproachfully



<P>that she felt as if she had insulted him by the suggestion, and



<P>answered heartily...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I didn't.&nbsp; I knew you were busy about your own affairs,



<P>but we rather missed you, Father and Mother especially."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm always glad to see you, sir."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In her anxiety to keep her voice quite calm, Jo made it rather



<P>cool, and the frosty little monosyllable at the end seemed to chill



<P>the Professor, for his smile vanished, as he said gravely...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I thank you, and come one more time before I go."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are going, then?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I haf no longer any business here, it is done."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Successfully, I hope?" said Jo, for the bitterness of disappointment



<P>was in that short reply of his.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I ought to think so, for I haf a way opened to me by which



<P>I can make my bread and gif my Junglings much help."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Tell me, please!&nbsp; I like to know all about the--the boys,"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>said Jo eagerly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That is so kind, I gladly tell you.&nbsp; My friends find for me



<P>a place in a college, where I teach as at home, and earn enough



<P>to make the way smooth for Franz and Emil.&nbsp; For this I should be



<P>grateful, should I not?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed you should.&nbsp; How splendid it will be to have you



<P>doing what you like, and be able to see you often, and the boys!"



<P>cried Jo, clinging to the lads as an excuse for the satisfaction



<P>she could not help betraying.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah!&nbsp; But we shall not meet often, I fear, this place is at



<P>the West."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So far away!"&nbsp; And Jo left her skirts to their fate, as if



<P>it didn't matter now what became of her clothes or herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Bhaer could read several languages, but he had not



<P>learned to read women yet.&nbsp; He flattered himself that he knew



<P>Jo pretty well, and was, therefore, much amazed by the contradictions



<P>of voice, face, and manner, which she showed him in rapid



<P>succession that day, for she was in half a dozen different



<P>moods in the course of half an hour.&nbsp; When she met him she looked



<P>surprised, though it was impossible to help suspecting that she



<P>had come for that express purpose.&nbsp; When he offered her his arm,



<P>she took it with a look that filled him with delight, but when



<P>he asked if she missed him, she gave such a chilly, formal reply



<P>that despair fell upon him.&nbsp; On learning his good fortune she



<P>almost clapped her hands.&nbsp; Was the joy all for the boys?&nbsp;

Then



<P>on hearing his destination, she said, "So far away!" in a tone



<P>of despair that lifted him on to a pinnacle of hope, but the



<P>next minute she tumbled him down again by observing, like one



<P>entirely absorbed in the matter...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here's the place for my errands.&nbsp; Will you come in? It



<P>won't take long."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo rather prided herself upon her shopping capabilities,



<P>and particularly wished to impress her escort with the neatness



<P>and dispatch with which she would accomplish the business.



<P>But owing to the flutter she was in, everything went amiss.



<P>She upset the tray of needles, forgot the silesia was to be



<P>`twilled' till it was cut off, gave the wrong change, and



<P>covered herself with confusion by asking for lavender ribbon



<P>at the calico counter.&nbsp; Mr. Bhaer stood by, watching her blush



<P>and blunder, and as he watched, his own bewilderment seemed to



<P>subside, for he was beginning to see that on some occasions,



<P>women, like dreams, go by contraries.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When they came out, he put the parcel under his arm with



<P>a more cheerful aspect, and splashed through the puddles as if



<P>he rather enjoyed it on the whole.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Should we no do a little what you call shopping for the



<P>babies, and haf a farewell feast tonight if I go for my last



<P>call at your so pleasant home?" he asked, stopping before a



<P>window full of fruit and flowers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What will we buy?" asked Jo, ignoring the latter part of



<P>his speech, and sniffing the mingled odors with an affectation



<P>of delight as they went in.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"May they haf oranges and figs?" asked Mr. Bhaer, with a



<P>paternal air.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They eat them when they can get them."



<P>"Do you care for nuts?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Like a squirrel."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hamburg grapes.&nbsp; Yes, we shall drink to the Fatherland in



<P>those?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo frowned upon that piece of extravagance, and asked why



<P>he didn't buy a frail of dated, a cask of raisins, and a bag of



<P>almonds, and be done with it?&nbsp; Whereat Mr. Bhaer confiscated her



<P>purse, produced his own, and finished the marketing by buying



<P>several pounds of grapes, a pot of rosy daisies, and a pretty



<P>jar of honey, to be regarded in the light of a demijohn.&nbsp; Then



<P>distorting his pockets with knobby bundles, and giving her the



<P>flowers to hold, he put up the old umbrella, and they traveled



<P>on again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Miss Marsch, I haf a great favor to ask of you," began the



<P>Professor, after a moist promenade of half a block.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, sir." And Jo's heart began to beat so hard she was



<P>afraid he would hear it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am bold to say it in spite of the rain, because so short



<P>a time remains to me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, sir."&nbsp; And Jo nearly crushed the small flowerpot with



<P>the sudden squeeze she gave it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wish to get a little dress for my Tina, and I am too stupid



<P>to go alone.&nbsp; Will you kindly gif me a word of taste and help?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, sir." And JO felt as calm and cool all of a sudden as if



<P>she had stepped into a refrigerator.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Perhaps also a shawl for Tina's mother, she is so poor and sick,



<P>and the husband is such a care.&nbsp; Yes, yes, a thick, warm shawl



<P>would be a friendly thing to take the little mother."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll do it with pleasure, Mr. Bhaer.&nbsp; I'm going very fast,



<P>and he's getting dearer every minute," added Jo to herself, then



<P>with a mental shake she entered into the business with an energy



<P>that was pleasant to behold.



<P>Mr. Bhaer left it all to her, so she chose a pretty gown for



<P>Tina, and then ordered out the shawls.&nbsp; The clerk, being a married



<P>man, condescended to take an interest in the couple, who appeared



<P>to be shopping for their family.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your lady may prefer this.&nbsp; It's a superior article, a most



<P>desirable color, quite chaste and genteel," he said, shaking out



<P>a comfortable gray shawl, and throwing it over Jo's shoulders.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Does this suit you, Mr. Bhaer?" she asked, turning her



<P>back to him, and feeling deeply grateful for the chance of hiding



<P>her face.



<P>"Excellently well, we will haf it," answered the Professor,



<P>smiling to himself as he paid for it, while Jo continued to



<P>rummage the counters like a confirmed bargain-hunter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now shall we go home?" he asked, as if the words were



<P>very pleasant to him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, it's late, and I'm so tired." Jo's voice was more



<P>pathetic than she knew.&nbsp; For now the sun seemed to have gone



<P>in as suddenly as it came out, and the world grew muddy and



<P>miserable again, and for the first time she discovered that her



<P>feet were cold, her head ached, and that her heart was colder



<P>than the former, fuller of pain than the latter.&nbsp; Mr. Bhaer



<P>was going away, he only cared for her as a friend, it was all



<P>a mistake, and the sooner it was over the better.&nbsp; With this



<P>idea in her head, she hailed an approaching omnibus with such



<P>a hasty gesture that the daisies flew out of the pot and were



<P>badly damaged.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This is not our omniboos," said the Professor, waving the



<P>loaded vehicle away, and stopping to pick up the poor little



<P>flowers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I beg your pardon.&nbsp; I didn't see the name distinctly.&nbsp; Never



<P>mind, I can walk.&nbsp; I'm used to plodding in the mud," returned Jo,



<P>winking hard, because she would have died rather than openly



<P>wipe her eyes.



<P>Mr. Bhaer saw the drops on her cheeks, though she turned her



<P>head away.&nbsp; The sight seemed to touch him very much, for suddenly



<P>stooping down, he asked in a tone that meant a great deal, "Heart's



<P>dearest, why do you cry?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, if Jo had not been new to this sort of thing she would



<P>have said she wasn't crying, had a cold in her head, or told



<P>any other feminine fib proper to the occasion.&nbsp; Instead of which,



<P>that undignified creature answered, with an irrepressible sob,



<P>"Because you are going away."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ach, mein Gott, that is so good!" cried Mr. Bhaer, managing



<P>to clasp his hands in spite of the umbrella and the bundles,



<P>"Jo, I haf nothing but much love to gif you.&nbsp; I came to see if



<P>you could care for it, and I waited to be sure that I was something



<P>more than a friend.&nbsp; Am I?&nbsp; Can you make a little place in

your



<P>heart for old Fritz?" he added, all in one breath.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, yes!" said Jo, and he was quite satisfied, for she



<P>folded both hands over his are, and looked up at him with an



<P>expression that plainly showed how happy she would be to walk



<P>through life beside him, even though she had no better shelter



<P>than the old umbrella, if he carried it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was certainly proposing under difficulties, for even if



<P>he had desired to do so, Mr. Bhaer could not go down upon his



<P>knees, on account of the mud.&nbsp; Neither could he offer Jo his



<P>hand, except figuratively, for both were full.&nbsp; Much less could



<P>he indulge in tender remonstrations in the open street, though



<P>he was near it.&nbsp; So the only way in which he could express his



<P>rapture was to look at her, with an expression which glorified



<P>his face to such a degree that there actually seemed to be



<P>little rainbows in the drops that sparkled on his beard.&nbsp; If



<P>he had not loved Jo very much, I don't think he could have done



<P>it then, for she looked far from lovely, with her skirts in a



<P>deplorable state, her rubber boots splashed to the ankle, and



<P>her bonnet a ruin.&nbsp; Fortunately, Mr. Bhaer considered her the



<P>most beautiful woman living, and she found him more `Jove-like"



<P>than ever, though his hatbrim was quite limp with the little



<P>rills trickling thence upon his shoulders (for he held the



<P>umbrella all over Jo), and every finger of his gloves needed



<P>mending.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Passers-by probably thought them a pair of harmless lunatics,



<P>for they entirely forgot to hail a bus, and strolled



<P>leisurely along, oblivious of deepening dusk and fog.&nbsp; Little



<P>they cared what anybody thought, for they were enjoying the



<P>happy hour that seldom comes but once in any life, the magical



<P>moment which bestows youth on the old, beauty on the plain,



<P>wealth on the poor, and gives human hearts a foretaste of heaven.



<P>The Professor looked as if he had conquered a kingdom, and the



<P>world had nothing more to offer him in the way of bliss.&nbsp; While



<P>Jo trudged beside him, feeling as if her place had always been



<P>there, and wondering how she ever could have chosen any other



<P>lot.&nbsp; Of course, she was the first to speak--intelligibly, I



<P>mean, for the emotional remarks which followed her impetuous



<P>"Oh, yes!" were not of a coherent or reportable character.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Friedrich, why didn't you..."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, heaven, she gifs me the name that no one speaks since



<P>Minna died!" cried the Professor, pausing in a puddle to regard



<P>her with grateful delight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I always call you so to myself--I forgot, but I won't unless



<P>you like it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Like it?&nbsp; It is more sweet to me than I can tell.&nbsp; Say `thou',



<P>also, and I shall say your language is almost as beautiful as mine."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Isn't `thou' a little sentimental?" asked Jo, privately thinking



<P>it a lovely monosyllable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sentimental? Yes.&nbsp; Thank Gott, we Germans believe in sentiment,



<P>and keep ourselves young mit it.&nbsp; Your English `you' is so cold,

say



<P>`thou', heart's dearest, it means so much to me," pleaded Mr. Bhaer,



<P>more like a romantic student than a grave professor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, then, why didn't thou tell me all this sooner?" asked



<P>Jo bashfully.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now I shall haf to show thee all my heart, and I so gladly



<P>will, because thou must take care of it hereafter.&nbsp; See, then,

my



<P>Jo--ah, the dear, funny little name--I had a wish to tell something



<P>the day I said goodbye in New York, but I thought the handsome



<P>friend was betrothed to thee, and so I spoke not.&nbsp; Wouldst thou



<P>have said `Yes', then, if I had spoken?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't know.&nbsp; I'm afraid not, for I didn't have any heart just

then."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Prut!&nbsp; That I do not believe.&nbsp; It was asleep till the fairy

prince



<P>came through the wood, and waked it up.&nbsp; Ah, well, `Die erste Liebe



<P>ist die beste', but that I should not expect."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, the first love is the best, but be so contented, for I



<P>never had another.&nbsp; Teddy was only a boy, and soon got over his



<P>little fancy," said Jo, anxious to correct the Professor's mistake.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Good!&nbsp; Then I shall rest happy, and be sure that thou givest



<P>me all.&nbsp; I haf waited so long, I am grown selfish, as thou wilt



<P>find , Professorin."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I like that," cried Jo, delighted with her new name.&nbsp; "Now



<P>tell me what brought you, at last, just when I wanted you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This." And Mr. Bhaer took a little worn paper out of his



<P>waistcoat pocket.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo unfolded it, and looked much abashed, for it was one of



<P>her own contributions to a paper that paid for poetry, which



<P>accounted for her sending it an occasional attempt.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How could that bring you?" she asked, wondering what he



<P>meant.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I found it by chance.&nbsp; I knew it by the names and the



<P>initials, and in it there was one little verse that seemed to



<P>call me.&nbsp; Read and find him.&nbsp; I will see that you go not in



<P>the wet."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>IN THE GARRET



<P>Four little chests all in a row,



<P>Dim with dust, and worn by time,



<P>All fashioned and filled, long ago,



<P>By children now in their prime.



<P>Four little keys hung side by side,



<P>With faded ribbons, brave and gay



<P>When fastened there, with childish pride,



<P>Long ago, on a rainy day.



<P>Four little names, one on each lid,



<P>Carved out by a boyish hand,



<P>And underneath there lieth hid



<P>Histories of the happpy band



<P>Once playing here, and pausing oft



<P>To hear the sweet refrain,



<P>That came and went on the roof aloft,



<P>In the falling summer rain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Meg" on the first lid, smooth and fair.



<P>I look in with loving eyes,



<P>For folded here, with well-known care,



<P>A goodly gathering lies,



<P>The record of a peaceful life--



<P>Gifts to gentle child and girl,



<P>A bridal gown, lines to a wife,



<P>A tiny shoe, a baby curl.



<P>No toys in this first chest remain,



<P>For all are carried away,



<P>In their old age, to join again



<P>In another small Meg's play.



<P>Ah, happy mother!&nbsp; Well I know



<P>You hear, like a sweet refrain,



<P>Lullabies ever soft and low



<P>In the falling summer rain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Jo" on the next lid, scratched and worn,



<P>And within a motley store



<P>Of headless, dolls, of schoolbooks torn,



<P>Birds and beasts that speak no more,



<P>Spoils brought home from the fairy ground



<P>Only trod by youthful feet,



<P>Dreams of a future never found,



<P>Memories of a past still sweet,



<P>Half-writ poems, stories wild,



<P>April letters, warm and cold,



<P>Diaries of a wilful child,



<P>Hints of a woman early old,



<P>A woman in a lonely home,



<P>Hearing, like a sad refrain--



<P>"Be worthy, love, and love will come,"



<P>In the falling summer rain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>My Beth!&nbsp; the dust is always swept



<P>From the lid that bears your name,



<P>As if by loving eyes that wept,



<P>By careful hands that often came.



<P>Death cannonized for us one saint,



<P>Ever less human than divine,



<P>And still we lay, with tender plaint,



<P>Relics in this household shrine--



<P>The silver bell, so seldom rung,



<P>The little cap which last she wore,



<P>The fair, dead Catherine that hung



<P>By angels borne above her door.



<P>The songs she sang, without lament,



<P>In her prison-house of pain,



<P>Forever are they sweetly blent



<P>With the falling summer rain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Upon the last lid's polished field--



<P>Legend now both fair and true



<P>A gallant knight bears on his shield,



<P>"Amy" in letters gold and blue.



<P>Within lie snoods that bound her hair,



<P>Slippers that have danced their last,



<P>Faded flowers laid by with care,



<P>Fans whose airy toils are past,



<P>Gay valentines, all ardent flames,



<P>Trifles that have borne their part



<P>In girlish hopes and fears and shames,



<P>The record of a maiden heart



<P>Now learning fairer, truer spells,



<P>Hearing, like a blithe refrain,



<P>The silver sound of bridal bells



<P>In the falling summer rain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Four little chests all in a row,



<P>Dim with dust, and worn by time,



<P>Four women, taught by weal and woe



<P>To love and labor in their prime.



<P>Four sisters, parted for an hour,



<P>None lost, one only gone before,



<P>Made by love's immortal power,



<P>Nearest and dearest evermore.



<P>Oh, when these hidden stores of ours



<P>Lie open to the Father's sight,



<P>May they be rich in golden hours,



<P>Deeds that show fairer for the light,



<P>Lives whose brave music long shall ring,



<P>Like a spirit-stirring strain,



<P>Souls that shall gladly soar and sing



<P>In the long sunshine after rain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's very bad poetry, but I felt it when I wrote it, one day



<P>when I was very lonely, and had a good cry on a rag bag.&nbsp; I never



<P>thought it would go where it could tell tales," said Jo, tearing



<P>up the verses the Professor had treasured so long.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Let it go, it has done it's duty, and I will haf a fresh one



<P>when I read all the brown book in which she keeps her little



<P>secrets," said Mr. Bhaer with a smile as he watched the fragments



<P>fly away on the wind.&nbsp; "Yes," he added earnestly, "I read that,



<P>and I think to myself, She has a sorrow, she is lonely, she would



<P>find comfort in true love.&nbsp; I haf a heart full, full for her.&nbsp;

Shall



<P>I not go and say, "If this is not too poor a thing to gif for what



<P>I shall hope to receive, take it in Gott's name?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And so you came to find that it was not too poor, but the one



<P>precious thing I needed," whispered Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I had no courage to think that at first, heavenly kind as was



<P>your welcome to me.&nbsp; But soon I began to hope, and then I said,



<P>`I will haf her if I die for it,' and so I will!" cried Mr. Bhaer,



<P>with a defiant nod, as if the walls of mist closing round them were



<P>barriers which he was to surmount or valiantly knock down.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo thought that was splendid, and resolved to be worthy of her knight,



<P>though he did not come prancing on a charger in gorgeous array.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What made you stay away so long?" she asked presently, finding



<P>it so pleasant to ask confidential questions and get delightful



<P>answers that she could not keep silent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It was not easy, but I could not find the heart to take you



<P>from that so happy home until I could haf a prospect of one to



<P>gif you, after much time, perhaps, and hard work.&nbsp; How could I

ask



<P>you to gif up so much for a poor old fellow, who has no fortune



<P>but a little learning?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm glad you are poor.&nbsp; I couldn't bear a rich husband,"



<P>said Jo decidedly, adding in a softer tone, "Don't fear poverty.



<P>I've known it long enough to lose my dread and be happy working



<P>for those I love, and don't call yourself old--forty is the prime



<P>of life.&nbsp; I couldn't help loving you if you were seventy!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Professor found that so touching that he would have been



<P>glad of his handkerchief, if he could have got at it.&nbsp; As her



<P>couldn't, Jo wiped his eyes for him, and said, laughing, as she



<P>took away a bundle or two...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I may be strong-minded, but no one can say I'm out of my



<P>sphere now, for woman's special mission is supposed to be drying



<P>tears and bearing burdens.&nbsp; I'm to carry my share, Friedrich,



<P>and help to earn the home.&nbsp; Make up your mind to that, or I'll



<P>never go," she added resolutely, as he tried to reclaim his load.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We shall see.&nbsp; Haf you patience to wait a long time, Jo?



<P>I must go away and do my work alone.&nbsp; I must help my boys first,



<P>because, even for you, I may not break my word to Minna.&nbsp; Can



<P>you forgif that, and be happy while we hope and wait?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, I know I can, for we love one another, and that makes



<P>all the rest easy to bear.&nbsp; I have my duty, also, and my work.



<P>I couldn't enjoy myself if I neglected them even for you, so



<P>there's no need of hurry or impatience.&nbsp; You can do your part



<P>out West, I can do mine here, and both be happy hoping for the



<P>best, and leaving the future to be as God wills."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! Thou gifest me such hope and courage, and I haf nothing



<P>to gif back but a full heart and these empty hands," cried the



<P>Professor, quite overcome.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo never, never would learn to be proper, for when he said



<P>that as they stood upon the steps, she just put both hands into



<P>his, whispering tenderly, "Not empty now," and stooping down,



<P>kissed her Friedrich under the umbrella.&nbsp; It was dreadful, but



<P>she would have done it if the flock of draggle-tailed sparrows



<P>on the hedge had been human beings, for she was very far gone



<P>indeed, and quite regardless of everything but her own happiness.



<P>Though it came in such a very simple guise, that was the crowning



<P>moment of both their lives, when, turning from the night and



<P>storm and loneliness to the household light and warmth and peace



<P>waiting to receive them, with a glad "Welcome home!"&nbsp; Jo led her



<P>lover in, and shut the door.

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For a year Jo and her Professor worked and waited, hoped



<P>and loved, met occasionally, and wrote such voluminous letters



<P>that the rise in the price of paper was accounted for, Laurie



<P>said.&nbsp; The second year began rather soberly, for their prospects



<P>did not brighten, and Aunt March died suddenly.&nbsp; But when their



<P>first sorrow was over--for they loved the old lady in spite



<P>of her sharp tongue--they found they had cause for rejoicing,



<P>for she had left Plumfield to Jo, which made all sorts of joyful



<P>things possible.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's a fine old place, and will bring a handsome sum, for



<P>of course you intend to sell it," said Laurie, as they were all



<P>talking the matter over some weeks later.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I don't," was Jo's decided answer, as she petted the



<P>fat poodle, whom she had adopted, out of respect to his former



<P>mistress.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You don't mean to live there?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, I do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But, my dear girl, it's an immense house, and will take a



<P>power of money to keep it in order.&nbsp; The garden and orchard alone



<P>need two or three men, and farming isn't in Bhaer's line, I take



<P>it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He'll try his hand at it there, if I propose it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And you expect to live on the produce of the place?&nbsp; Well,



<P>that sounds paradisiacal, but you'll find it desperate hard work."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The crop we are going to raise is a profitable one," And



<P>Jo laughed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Of what is this fine crop to consist, ma'am?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Boys.&nbsp; I want to open a school for little lads--a good,



<P>happy, homelike school, with me to take care of them and Fritz



<P>to teach them."



<P>"That's a truly Joian plan for you!&nbsp; Isn't that just like



<P>her?" cried Laurie, appealing to the family, who looked as much



<P>surprised as he.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I like it," said Mrs. March decidedly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So do I," added her husband, who welcomed the thought of



<P>a chance for trying the Socratic method of education on modern



<P>youth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It will be an immense care for Jo," said Meg, stroking



<P>the head or her one all-absorbing son.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Jo can do it, and be happy in it.&nbsp; It's a splendid idea.



<P>Tell us all about it," cried Mr. Laurence, who had been longing



<P>to lend the lovers a hand, but knew that they would refuse his



<P>help.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I knew you'd stand by me, sir.&nbsp; Amy does too--I see it in



<P>her eyes, though she prudently waits to turn it over in her mind



<P>before she speaks.&nbsp; Now, my dear people," continued Jo earnestly,



<P>"just understand that this isn't a new idea of mine, but a long



<P>cherished plan.&nbsp; Before my Fritz came, I used to think how, when



<P>I'd made my fortune, and no one needed me at home, I'd hire a



<P>big house, and pick up some poor, forlorn little lads who hadn't



<P>any mothers, and take care of them, and make life jolly for them



<P>before it was too late.&nbsp; I see so many going to ruin for want of



<P>help at the right minute, I love so to do anything for them, I



<P>seem to feel their wants, and sympathize with their troubles, and



<P>oh, I should so like to be a mother to them!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. March held out her hand to Jo, who took it, smiling,



<P>with tears in her eyes, and went on in the old enthusiastic way,



<P>which they had not seen for a long while.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I told my plan to Fritz once, and he said it was just what



<P>he would like, and agreed to try it when we got rich.&nbsp; Bless his



<P>dear heart, he's been doing it all his life--helping poor boys, I



<P>mean, not getting rich, that he'll never be.&nbsp; Money doesn't stay



<P>in his pocket long enough to lay up any.&nbsp; But now, thanks to my



<P>good old aunt, who loved me better than I ever deserved, I'm rich,



<P>at least I feel so, and we can live at Plumfield perfectly well,



<P>if we have a flourishing school.&nbsp; It's just the place for boys,



<P>the house is big, and the furniture strong and plain.&nbsp; There's



<P>plenty of room for dozens inside, and splendid grounds outside.



<P>They could help in the garden and orchard.&nbsp; Such work is healthy,



<P>isn't it, sir?&nbsp; Then Fritz could train and teach in his own way,



<P>and Father will help him.&nbsp; I can feed and nurse and pet and scold



<P>them, and Mother will be my stand-by.&nbsp; I've always longed for lots



<P>of boys, and never had enough, now I can fill the house full and



<P>revel in the little dears to my heart's content.&nbsp; Think what luxury--



<P>Plumfield my own, and a wilderness of boys to enjoy it with me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As Jo waved her hands and gave a sigh of rapture, the family



<P>went off into a gale of merriment, and Mr. Laurence laughed till



<P>they thought he'd have an apoplectic fit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't see anything funny," she said gravely, when she



<P>could be heard.&nbsp; "Nothing could be more natural and proper than



<P>for my Professor to open a school, and for me to prefer to reside



<P>in my own estate."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She is putting on airs already," said Laurie, who regarded



<P>the idea in the light of a capital joke.&nbsp; "But may I inquire how



<P>you intend to support the establishment? If all the pupils are



<P>little ragamuffins, I'm afraid your crop won't be profitable in



<P>a worldly sense, Mr. Bhaer."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now don't be a wet-blanket, Teddy.&nbsp; Of course I shall have



<P>rich pupils, also--perhaps begin with such altogether.&nbsp; Then,



<P>when I've got a start, I can take in a ragamuffin or two, just



<P>for a relish.&nbsp; Rich people's children often need care and comfort,



<P>as well as poor.&nbsp; I've seen unfortunate little creatures left to



<P>servants, or backward ones pushed forward, when it's real cruelty.



<P>Some are naughty through mismanagment or neglect, and some lose



<P>their mothers.&nbsp; Besides, the best have to get through the hobbledehoy



<P>age, and that's the very time they need most patience and kindness.



<P>People laugh at them, and hustle them about, try to keep them



<P>out of sight, and expect them to turn all at once from pretty



<P>children into fine young men.&nbsp; They don't complain much--



<P>plucky little souls--but they feel it.&nbsp; I've been through some-



<P>thing of it, and I know all about it.&nbsp; I've a special interest



<P>in such young bears, and like to show them that I see the warm,



<P>honest, well-meaning boys' hearts, in spite of the clumsy arms



<P>and legs and the topsy-turvy heads.&nbsp; I've had experience, too,



<P>for haven't I brought up one boy to be a pride and honor to his family?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll testify that you tried to do it," said Laurie with a grateful

look.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And I've succeeded beyond my hopes, for here you are, a



<P>steady, sensible businessman, doing heaps of good with your



<P>money, and laying up the blessings of the poor, instead of dollars.



<P>But you are not merely a businessman, you love good and beautiful



<P>things, enjoy them yourself, and let others go halves, as you



<P>always did in the old times.&nbsp; I am proud of you, Teddy, for you



<P>get better every year, and everyone feels it, though you won't



<P>let them say so.&nbsp; Yes, and when I have my flock, I'll just point



<P>to you, and say `There's your model, my lads'."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Poor Laurie didn't know where to look, for, man though he



<P>was, something of the old bashfulness came over him as this burst



<P>of praise made all faces turn approvingly upon him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I say, Jo, that's rather too much," he began, just in his



<P>old boyish way.&nbsp; "You have all done more for me than I can ever



<P>thank you for, except by doing my best not to disapoint you.&nbsp; You



<P>have rather cast me off lately, Jo, but I've had the best of help,



<P>nevertheless.&nbsp; So, if I've got on at all, you may thank these two



<P>for it."&nbsp; And he laid one hand gently on his grandfather's head,



<P>and the other on Amy's golden one, for the three were never far



<P>apart.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do think that families are the most beautiful things in



<P>all the world!" burst out Jo, who was in an unusually up-lifted



<P>frame of mind just then.&nbsp; "When I have one of my own, I hope it



<P>will be as happy as the three I know and love the best.&nbsp; If John



<P>and my Fritz were only here, it would be quite a little heaven



<P>on earth," she added more quietly.&nbsp; And that night when she went



<P>to her room after a blissful evening of family counsels, hopes,



<P>and plans, her heart was so full of happiness that she could only



<P>calm it by kneeling beside the empty bed always near her own, and



<P>thinking tender thoughts of Beth.



<P>It was a very astonishing year altogether, for things seemed



<P>to happen in an unusually rapid and delightful manner.&nbsp; Almost



<P>before she knew where she was, Jo found herself married and settled



<P>at Plumfield.&nbsp; Then a family of six or seven boys sprung up



<P>like mushrooms, and flourished surprisingly, poor boys as well as



<P>rich, for Mr. Laurence was continually finding some touching case



<P>of destitution, and begging the Bhaers to take pity on the child,



<P>and he would gladly pay a trifle for its support.&nbsp; In this way,



<P>the sly old gentleman got round proud Jo, and furnished her with



<P>the style of boy in which she most delighted.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Of course it was uphill work at first, and Jo made queer



<P>mistakes, but the wise Professor steered her safely into calmer



<P>waters, and the most rampant ragamuffin was conquered in the end.



<P>How Jo did enjoy her `wilderness of boys', and how poor, dear



<P>Aunt March would have lamented had she been there to see the



<P>sacred precincts of prim, well-ordered Plumfield overrun with



<P>Toms, Dicks, and Harrys!&nbsp; There was a sort of poetic justice



<P>about it, after all, for the old lady had been the terror of the boys



<P>for miles around, and now the exiles feasted freely on forbidden



<P>plums, kicked up the gravel with profane boots unreproved,



<P>and played cricket in the big field where the irritable



<P>`cow with a crumpled horn' used to invite rash youths to come and



<P>be tossed.&nbsp; It became a sort of boys' paradise, and Laurie suggested



<P>that it should be called the `Bhaer-garten', as a compliment



<P>to its master and appropriate to its inhabitants.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It never was a fashionable school, and the Professor did not



<P>lay up a fortune, but it was just what Jo intended it to be--



<P>`a happy, homelike place for boys, who needed teaching, care, and



<P>kindness'.&nbsp; Every room in the big house was soon full.&nbsp; Every



<P>little plot in the garden soon had its owner.&nbsp; A regular menagerie



<P>appeared in barn and shed, for pet animals were allowed.



<P>And three times a day, Jo smiled at her Fritz from the head of



<P>a long table lined on either side with rows of happy young faces,



<P>which all turned to her with affectionate eyes, confiding words,



<P>and grateful hearts, full of love for `Mother Bhaer'.&nbsp; She had



<P>boys enough now, and did not tire of them, though they were not



<P>angels, by any means, and some of them caused both Professor and



<P>Professorin much trouble and anxiety.&nbsp; But her faith in the good



<P>spot which exists in the heart of the naughtiest, sauciest, most



<P>tantalizing little ragamuffin gave her patience, skill, and in



<P>time success, for no mortal boy could hold out long with Father



<P>Bhaer shining on him as benevolently as the sun, and Mother Bhaer



<P>forgiving him seventy times seven.&nbsp; Very precious to Jo was the



<P>friendship of the lads, their penitent sniffs and whispers after



<P>wrongdoing, their droll or touching little confidences, their



<P>pleasant enthusiasms, hopes, and plans, even their misfortunes,



<P>for they only endeared them to her all the more.&nbsp; There were slow



<P>boys and bashful boys, feeble boys and riotous boys, boys that



<P>lisped and boys that stuttered, one or two lame ones, and a



<P>merry little quadroon, who could not be taken in elsewhere, but



<P>who was welcome to the `Bhaer-garten', though some people predicted



<P>that his admission would ruin the school.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Yes, Jo was a very happy woman there, in spite of hard work,



<P>much anxiety, and a perpetual racket.&nbsp; She enjoyed it heartily

and



<P>found the applause of her boys more satisfying than any praise of



<P>the world, for now she told no stories except to her flock of



<P>enthusiastic believers and admirers.&nbsp; As the years went on, two



<P>little lads of her own came to increase her happiness--Rob,



<P>named for Grandpa, and Teddy, a happy-go-lucky baby, who seemed



<P>to have inherited his papa's sunshiny temper as well as his



<P>mother's lively spirit.&nbsp; How they ever grew up alive in that



<P>whirlpool of boys was a mystery to their grandma and aunts, but



<P>they flourished like dandelions in spring, and their rough



<P>nurses loved and served them well.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There were a great many holidays at Plumfield, and one of



<P>the most delightful was the yearly apple-picking.&nbsp; For then the



<P>Marches, Laurences, Brookes.&nbsp; And Bhaers turned out in full force



<P>and made a day of it.&nbsp; Five years after Jo's wedding, one of these



<P>fruitful festivals occurred, a mellow October day, when the air



<P>was full of an exhilarating freshness which made the spirits rise



<P>and the blood dance healthily in the veins.&nbsp; The old orchard wore



<P>its holiday attire.&nbsp; Goldenrod and asters fringed the mossy walls.



<P>Grasshoppers skipped briskly in the sere grass, and crickets chirped



<P>like fairy pipers at a feast.&nbsp; Squirrels were busy with their



<P>small harvesting.&nbsp; Birds twittered their adieux from the alders



<P>in the lane, and every tree stood ready to send down its shower



<P>of red or yellow apples at the first shake.&nbsp; Everybody was there.



<P>Everybody laughed and sang, climbed up and tumbled down.&nbsp; Everybody



<P>declared that there never had been such a perfect day or such



<P>a jolly set to enjoy it, and everyone gave themselves up to



<P>the simple pleasures of the hour as freely as if there were no



<P>such things as care or sorrow in the world.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. March strolled placidly about, quoting Tusser, Cowley,



<P>and Columella to Mr. Laurence, while enjoying...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The gentle apple's winey juice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Professor charged up and down the green aisles like a stout



<P>Teutonic knight, with a pole for a lance, leading on the boys,



<P>who made a hook and ladder company of themselves, and performed



<P>wonders in the way of ground and lofty tumbling.&nbsp; Laurie devoted



<P>himself to the little ones, rode his small daughter in a bushel-basket,



<P>took Daisy up among the bird's nests, and kept adventurous



<P>Rob from breaking his neck.&nbsp; Mrs. March and Meg sat among



<P>the apple piles like a pair of Pomonas, sorting the contributions



<P>that kept pouring in, while Amy with a beautiful motherly expression



<P>in her face sketched the various groups, and watched over one



<P>pale lad, who sat adoring her with his little crutch beside him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo was in her element that day, and rushed about, with her



<P>gown pinned up, and her hat anywhere but on her head, and her



<P>baby tucked under her arm, ready for any lively adventure which



<P>might turn up.&nbsp; Little Teddy bore a charmed life, for nothing



<P>ever happened to him, and Jo never felt any anxiety when he was



<P>whisked up into a tree by one lad, galloped off on the back of



<P>another, or supplied with sour russets by his indulgent papa,



<P>who labored under the Germanic delusion that babies could digest



<P>anything, from pickled cabbage to buttons, nails, and their own



<P>small shoes.&nbsp; She knew that little Ted would turn up again in



<P>time, safe and rosy, dirty and serene, and she always received



<P>him back with a hearty welcome, for Jo loved her babies tenderly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At four o'clock a lull took place, and baskets remained



<P>empty, while the apple pickers rested and compared rents and



<P>bruises.&nbsp; Then Jo and Meg, with a detachment of the bigger boys,



<P>set forth the supper on the grass, for an out-of-door tea was



<P>always the crowning joy of the day.&nbsp; The land literally flowed



<P>with milk and honey on such occasions, for the lads were not



<P>required to sit at table, but allowed to partake of refreshment



<P>as they liked--freedom being the sauce best beloved by the boyish



<P>soul.&nbsp; They availed themselves of the rare privilege to the



<P>fullest extent, for some tried the pleasing experiment of drinking



<P>mild while standing on their heads, others lent a charm to



<P>leapfrog by eating pie in the pauses of the game, cookies were



<P>sown broadcast over the field, and apple turnovers roosted in



<P>the trees like a new style of bird.&nbsp; The little girls had a



<P>private tea party, and Ted roved among the edibles at his own



<P>sweet will.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When no one could eat any more, the Professor proposed the



<P>first regular toast, which was always drunk at such times--"Aunt



<P>March, God bless her!"&nbsp; A toast heartily given by the good man,



<P>who never forgot how much he owed her, and quietly drunk by the



<P>boys, who had been taught to keep her memory green.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now, Grandma's sixtieth birthday!&nbsp; Long life to her, with



<P>three times three!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That was given with a will, as you may well believe, and



<P>the cheering once begun, it was hard to stop it.&nbsp; Everybody's



<P>health was proposed, form Mr. Laurence, who was considered their



<P>special patron, to the astonished guinea pig, who had strayed



<P>from its proper sphere in search of its young master.&nbsp; Demi, as



<P>the oldest grandchild, then presented the queen of the day with



<P>various gifts, so numerous that they were transported to the



<P>festive scene in a wheelbarrow.&nbsp; Funny presents, some of them,



<P>but what would have been defects to other eyes were ornaments



<P>to Grandma's--for the children's gifts were all their own.&nbsp; Every



<P>stitch Daisy's patient little fingers had put into the handkerchiefs



<P>she hemmed was better than embroidery to Mrs. March.&nbsp; Demi's



<P>miracle of mechanical skill, though the cover wouldn't shut, Rob's



<P>footstool had a wiggle in its uneven legs that she declared was



<P>soothing, and no page of the costly book Amy's child gave her was



<P>so fair as that on which appeared in tipsy capitals, the words--



<P>"To dear Grandma, from her little Beth."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>During the ceremony the boys had mysteriously disappeared,



<P>and when Mrs. March had tried to thank her children, and broken



<P>down, while Teddy wiped her eyes on his pinafore, the Professor



<P>suddenly began to sing.&nbsp; Then, from above him, voice after voice



<P>took up the words, and from tree to tree echoed the music of the



<P>unseen choir, as the boys sang with all their hearts the little



<P>song that Jo had written, Laurie set to music, and the Professor



<P>trained his lads to give with the best effect.&nbsp; This was something



<P>altogether new, and it proved a grand success, for Mrs. March



<P>couldn't get over her surprise, and insisted on shaking hands



<P>with every one of the featherless birds, from tall Franz and



<P>Emil to the little quadroon, who had the sweetest voice of all.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After this, the boys dispersed for a final lark, leaving Mrs.



<P>March and her daughters under the festival tree.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't think I ever ought to call myself `unlucky Jo' again,



<P>when my greatest wish has been so beautifully gratified," said Mrs.



<P>Bhaer, taking Teddy's little fist out of the milk pitcher, in which



<P>he was rapturously churning.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And yet your life is very different from the one you pictured



<P>so long ago.&nbsp; Do you remember our castles in the air?" asked Amy,



<P>smiling as she watched Laurie and John playing cricket with the boys.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dear fellows!&nbsp; It does my heart good to see them forget business



<P>and frolic for a day," answered Jo, who now spoke in a maternal



<P>way of all mankind.&nbsp; "Yes, I remember, but the life I wanted then



<P>seems selfish, lonely, and cold to me now.&nbsp; I haven't given up

the



<P>hope that I may write a good book yet, but I can wait, and I'm



<P>sure it will be all the better for such experiences and illustrations



<P>as these."&nbsp; And Jo pointed from the lively lads in the



<P>distance to her father, leaning on the Professor's arm, as they



<P>walked to and fro in the sunshine, deep in one of the conversations



<P>which both enjoyed so much, and then to her mother, sitting enthroned



<P>among her daughters, with their children in her lap and at



<P>her feet, as if all found help and happiness in the face which



<P>never could grow old to them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My castle was the most nearly realized of all.&nbsp; I asked for



<P>splendid things, to be sure, but in my heart I knew I should be



<P>satisfied, if I had a little home, and John, and some dear children



<P>like these.&nbsp; I've got them all, thank God, and am the



<P>happiest woman in the world."&nbsp; And Meg laid her hand on her tall



<P>boy's head, with a face full of tender and devout content.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My castle is very different from what I planned, but I would



<P>not alter it, though, like Jo, I don't relinquish all my artistic



<P>hopes, or confine myself to helping others fulfill their dreams of



<P>beauty.&nbsp; I've begun to model a figure of baby, and Laurie says

it



<P>is the best thing I've ever done.&nbsp; I think so, myself, and mean



<P>to do it in marble, so that, whatever happens, I may at least keep



<P>the image of my little angel."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As Amy spoke, a great tear dropped on the golden hair of the



<P>sleeping child in her arms, for her one well-beloved daughter was



<P>a frail little creature and the dread of losing her was the shadow



<P>over Amy's sunshine.&nbsp; This cross was doing much for both father



<P>and mother, for one love and sorrow bound them closely together.



<P>Amy's nature was growing sweeter, deeper, and more tender.&nbsp; Laurie



<P>was growing more serious, strong, and firm, and both were learning



<P>that beauty, youth, good fortune, even love itself, cannot keep



<P>care and pain, loss and sorrow, from the most blessed for ...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Into each life some rain must fall,



<P>Some days must be dark and sad and dreary.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She is growing better, I am sure of it, my dear.&nbsp; Don't



<P>despond, but hope and keep happy," said Mrs. March, as tenderhearted



<P>Daisy stooped from her knee to lay her rosy cheek against



<P>her little cousin's pale one.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I never ought to, while I have you to cheer me up, Marmee,



<P>and Laurie to take more than half of every burden," replied Amy



<P>warmly.&nbsp; "He never lets me see his anxiety, but is so sweet and



<P>patient with me, so devoted to Beth, and such a stay and comfort



<P>to me always that I can't love him enough.&nbsp; So, in spite of my



<P>one cross, I can say with Meg, `Thank God, I'm a happy woman.'"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There's no need for me to say it, for everyone can see



<P>that I'm far happier than I deserve," added Jo, glancing from



<P>her good husband to her chubby children, tumbling on the grass



<P>beside her.&nbsp; "Fritz is getting gray and stout.&nbsp; I'm growing

as



<P>thin as a shadow, and am thirty.&nbsp; We never shall be rich, and



<P>Plumfield may burn up any night, for that incorrigible Tommy



<P>Bangs will smoke sweet-fern cigars under the bed-clothes,



<P>though he's set himself afire three times already.&nbsp; But in



<P>spite of these unromantic facts, I have nothing to complain



<P>of, and never was so jolly in my life.&nbsp; Excuse the remark, but



<P>living among boys, I can't help using their expressions now



<P>and then."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, Jo, I think your harvest will be a good one," began



<P>Mrs. March, frightening away a big black cricket that was



<P>staring Teddy out of countenance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not half so good as yours, Mother.&nbsp; Here it is, and we



<P>never can thank you enough for the patient sowing and reaping



<P>you have done," cried Jo, with the loving impetuosity which



<P>she never would outgrow.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hope there will be more wheat and fewer tares every



<P>year," said Amy softly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A large sheaf, but I know there's room in your heart for



<P>it, Marmee dear," added Meg's tender voice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Touched to the heart, Mrs. March could only stretch out



<P>her arms, as if to gather children and grandchildren to herself,



<P>and say, with face and voice full of motherly love, gratitude,



<P>and humility...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, my girls, however long you may live, I never can



<P>wish you a greater happiness than this!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<B>CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I cannot feel that I have done my duty as humble historian



<P>of the March family, without devoting at least one chapter to



<P>the two most precious and important members of it.&nbsp; Daisy and



<P>Demi had now arrived at years of discretion, for in this fast



<P>age babies of three or four assert their rights, and get them,



<P>too, which is more than many of their elders do.&nbsp; If there



<P>ever were a pair of twins in danger of being utterly spoiled



<P>by adoration, it was these prattling Brookes.&nbsp; Of course they



<P>were the most remarkable children ever born, as will be shown



<P>when I mention that they walked at eight months, talked fluently



<P>at twelve months, and at two years they took their places



<P>at table, and behaved with a propriety which charmed all beholders.



<P>At three, Daisy demanded a `needler', and actually made



<P>a bag with four stitches in it.&nbsp; She likewise set up



<P>housekeeping in the sideboard, and managed a microscopic cooking



<P>stove with a skill that brought tears of pride to Hannah's



<P>eyes, while Demi learned his letters with his grandfather, who



<P>invented a new mode of teaching the alphabet by forming letters



<P>with his arms and legs, thus uniting gymnastics for head and



<P>heels.&nbsp; The boy early developed a mechanical genius which delighted



<P>his father and distracted his mother, for he tried to



<P>imitate every machine he saw, and kept the nursery in a chaotic



<P>condition, with his `sewinsheen', a mysterious structure of



<P>string, chairs, clothespins, and spools, for wheels to go



<P>`wound and wound'.&nbsp; Also a basket hung over the back of a chair,



<P>in which he vainly tried to hoist his too confiding sister, who,



<P>with feminine devotion, allowed her little head to be bumped till



<P>rescued, when the young inventor indignantly remarked, "Why,



<P>Marmar, dat's my lellywaiter, and me's trying to pull her up."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Though utterly unlike in character, the twins got on remarkably



<P>well together, and seldom quarreled more than thrice



<P>a day.&nbsp; Of course, Demi tyrannized over Daisy, and gallantly



<P>defended her from every other aggressor, while Daisy made a



<P>galley slave of herself, and adored her brother as the one perfect



<P>being in the world.&nbsp; A rosy, chubby, sunshiny little soul



<P>was Daisy, who found her way to everybody's heart, and nestled



<P>there.&nbsp; One of the captivating children, who seem made to be



<P>kissed and cuddled, adorned and adored like little goddesses,



<P>and produced for general approval on all festive occasions.



<P>Her small virtues were so sweet that she would have been quite



<P>angelic if a few small naughtinesses had not kept her delightfully



<P>human.&nbsp; It was all fair weather in her world, and every



<P>morning she scrambled up to the window in her little nightgown



<P>to look our, and say, no matter whether it rained or shone,



<P>"Oh, pitty day, oh, pitty day!" Everyone was a friend, and she



<P>offered kisses to a stranger so confidingly that the most inveterate



<P>bachelor relented, and baby-lovers became faithful



<P>worshipers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Me loves evvybody," she once said, opening her arms, with



<P>her spoon in one hand, and her mug in the other, as if eager to



<P>embrace and nourish the whole world.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As she grew, her mother began to feel that the Dovecote



<P>would be blessed by the presence of an inmate as serene and loving



<P>as that which had helped to make the old house home, and to



<P>pray that she might be spared a loss like that which had lately



<P>taught them how long they had entertained an angel unawares.&nbsp; Her



<P>grandfather often called her `Beth', and her grandmother watched



<P>over her with untiring devotion, as if trying to atone for some



<P>past mistake, which no eye but her own could see.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Demi, like a true Yankee, was of an inquiring turn, wanting



<P>to know everything, and often getting much disturbed because he



<P>could not get satisfactory answers to his perpetual "What for?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He also possessed a philosophic bent, to the great delight of



<P>his grandfather, who used to hold Socratic conversations with him,



<P>in which the precocious pupil occasionally posed his teacher, to



<P>the undisguised satisfaction of the womenfolk.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What makes my legs go, Dranpa?" asked the young philosopher,



<P>surveying those active portions of his frame with a meditative air,



<P>while resting after a go-to-bed frolic one night.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's your little mind, Demi," replied the sage, stroking the



<P>yellow head respectfully.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What is a little mine?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is something which makes your body move, as the spring



<P>made the wheels go in my watch when I showed it to you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Open me.&nbsp; I want to see it go wound."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I can't do that any more than you could open the watch.&nbsp; God



<P>winds you up, and you go till He stops you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Does I?" And Demi's brown eyes grew big and bright as he



<P>took in the new thought.&nbsp; "Is I wounded up like the watch?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, but I can't show you how, for it is done when we don't see."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Demi felt his back, as if expecting to find it like that of



<P>the watch, and then gravely remarked, "I dess Dod does it when



<P>I's asleep."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A careful explanation followed, to which he listened so attentively



<P>that his anxious grandmother said, "My dear, do you think it wise



<P>to talk about such things to that baby?&nbsp; He's getting great bumps



<P>over his eyes, and learning to ask the most unanswerable questions."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If he is old enough to ask the question he is old enough to



<P>receive true answers.&nbsp; I am not putting the thoughts into his



<P>head, but helping him unfold those already there.&nbsp; These children



<P>are wiser than we are, and I have no doubt the boy understands



<P>every word I have said to him.&nbsp; Now, Demi, tell me where you keep



<P>your mind."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If the boy had replied like Alcibiades, "By the gods, Socrates,



<P>I cannot tell," his grandfather would not have been surprised, but



<P>when, after standing a moment on one leg, like a meditative young



<P>stork, he answered, in a tone of calm conviction, "In my little



<P>belly," the old gentleman could only join in Grandma's laugh, and



<P>dismiss the class in metaphysics.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There might have been cause for maternal anxiety, if Demi had



<P>not given convincing proofs that he was a true boy, as well as a



<P>budding philosopher, for often, after a discussion which caused



<P>Hannah to prophesy, with ominous nods, "That child ain't long for



<P>this world," he would turn about and set her fears at rest by



<P>some of the pranks with which dear, dirty, naughty little rascals



<P>distract and delight their parent's souls.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg made many moral rules, and tried to keep them, but what



<P>mother was ever proof against the winning wiles, the ingenious



<P>evasions, or the tranquil audacity of the miniature men and women



<P>who so early show themselves accomplished Artful Dodgers?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No more raisins, Demi.&nbsp; They'll make you sick," says Mamma



<P>to the young person who offers his services in the kitchen with



<P>unfailing regularity on plum-pudding day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Me likes to be sick."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't want to have you, so run away and help Daisy make patty cakes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He reluctantly departs, but his wrongs weigh upon his spirit,



<P>and by-and-by when an opportunity comes to redress them, he outwits



<P>Mamma by a shrewd bargain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now you have been good children, and I'll play anything you



<P>like," says Meg, as she leads her assistant cooks upstairs, when



<P>the pudding is safely bouncing in the pot.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Truly, Marmar?" asks Demi, with a brilliant idea in his well-powdered

head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, truly.&nbsp; Anything you say," replies the shortsighted parent,



<P>preparing herself to sing, "The Three Little Kittens" half a



<P>dozen times over, or to take her family to "Buy a penny bun," regardless



<P>of wind or limb.&nbsp; But Demi corners her by the cool reply...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then we'll go and eat up all the raisins."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Aunt Dodo was chief playmate and confidante of both children,



<P>and the trio turned the little house topsy-turvy.&nbsp; Aunt Amy was

as



<P>yet only a name to them, Aunt Beth soon faded into a pleasantly



<P>vague memory, but Aunt Dodo was a living reality, and they made the



<P>most of her, for which compliment she was deeply grateful.&nbsp; But



<P>when Mr. Bhaer came, Jo neglected her playfellows, and dismay and



<P>desolation fell upon their little souls.&nbsp; Daisy, who was fond of



<P>going about peddling kisses, lost her best customer and became



<P>bankrupt.&nbsp; Demi, with infantile penetration, soon discovered that



<P>Dodo like to play with `the bear-man' better than she did him,



<P>but though hurt, he concealed his anguish, for he hadn't the



<P>heart to insult a rival who kept a mine of chocolate drops in



<P>his waistcoat pocket, and a watch that could be taken out of its



<P>case and freely shaken by ardent admirers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Some persons might have considered these pleasing liberties



<P>as bribes, but Demi didn't see it in that light, and continued to



<P>patronize the `the bear-man' with pensive affability, while Daisy



<P>bestowed her small affections upon him at the third call, and



<P>considered his shoulder her throne, his arm her refuge, his gifts



<P>treasures surpassing worth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Gentlemen are sometimes seized with sudden fits of admiration



<P>for the young relatives of ladies whom they honor with their regard,



<P>but this counterfeit philoprogenitiveness sits uneasily upon them,



<P>and does not deceive anybody a particle.&nbsp; Mr. Bhaer's devotion

was



<P>sincere, however likewise effective--for honesty is the best policy



<P>in love as in law.&nbsp; He was one of the men who are at home with

children,



<P>and looked particularly well when little faces made a pleasant



<P>contrast with his manly one.&nbsp; His business, whatever it was, detained



<P>him from day to day, but evening seldom failed to bring him out to



<P>see--well, he always asked for Mr. March, so I suppose he was the



<P>attraction.&nbsp; The excellent papa labored under the delusion that

he



<P>was, and reveled in long discussions with the kindred spirit, till



<P>a chance remark of his more observing grandson suddenly enlightened

him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Bhaer came in one evening to pause on the threshold of the



<P>study, astonished by the spectacle that met his eye.&nbsp; Prone upon



<P>the floor lay Mr. March, with his respectable legs in the air, and



<P>beside him, likewise prone, was Demi, trying to imitate the attitude



<P>with his own short, scarlet-stockinged legs, both grovelers



<P>so seriously absorbed that they were unconscious of spectators,



<P>till Mr. Bhaer laughed his sonorous laugh, and Jo cried out, with



<P>a scandalized face...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Father, Father, here's the Professor!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Down went the black legs and up came the gray head, as the



<P>preceptor said, with undisturbed dignity, "Good evening, Mr. Bhaer.



<P>Excuse me for a moment.&nbsp; We are just finishing our lesson.&nbsp;

Now, Demi,



<P>make the letter and tell its name."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I knows him!"&nbsp; And, after a few convulsive efforts, the red



<P>legs tok the shape of a pair of compasses, and the intelligent



<P>pupil triumphantly shouted, "It's a We, Dranpa, it's a We!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He's a born Weller," laughed Jo, as her parent gathered himself



<P>up, and her nephew tried to stand on his head, as the only



<P>mode of expressing his satisfaction that school was over.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What have you been at today, bubchen?" asked Mr. Bhaer,



<P>picking up the gymnast.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Me went to see little Mary."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And what did you there?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I kissed her," began Demi, with artless frankness.



<P>"Prut!&nbsp; Thou beginnest early.&nbsp; What did the little Mary say



<P>to that?" asked Mr. Bhaer, continuing to confess the young sinner,



<P>who stood upon the knee, exploring the waistcoat pocket.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, she liked it, and she kissed me, and I liked it.&nbsp; Don't



<P>little boys like little girls?" asked Demi, with his mouth full,



<P>and an air of bland satisfaction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You precious chick!&nbsp; Who put that into your head?" said Jo,



<P>enjoying the innocent revelation as much as the Professor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"`Tisn't in mine head, it's in mine mouf," answered literal



<P>Demi, putting out his tongue, with a chocolate drop on it, thinking



<P>she alluded to confectionery, not ideas.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thou shouldst save some for the little friend.&nbsp; Sweets to



<P>the sweet, mannling." And Mr. Bhaer offered Jo some, with a look



<P>that made her wonder if chocolate was not the nectar drunk by the



<P>gods.&nbsp; Demi also saw the smile, was impressed by it, and artlessy



<P>inquired.&nbsp; ..

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do great boys like great girls, to, 'Fessor?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Like young Washington, Mr. Bhaer `couldn't tell a lie', so



<P>he gave the somewhat vague reply that he believed they did sometimes,



<P>in a tone that made Mr. March put down his clothesbrush,



<P>glance at Jo's retiring face, and then sink into his chair, looking



<P>as if the `precocious chick' had put an idea into his head



<P>that was both sweet and sour.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Why Dodo, when she caught him in the china closet half an



<P>hour afterward, nearly squeezed the breath out of his little body



<P>with a tender embrace, instead of shaking him for being there,



<P>and why she followed up this novel performance by the unexpected



<P>gift of a big slice of bread and jelly, remained one of the problems



<P>over which Demi puzzled his small wits, and was forced to



<P>leave unsolved forever.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Please, Madam Mother, could you lend me my wife for half



<P>an hour?&nbsp; The luggage has come, and I've been making hay of



<P>Amy's Paris finery, trying to find some things I want," said



<P>Laurie, coming in the next day to find Mrs. Laurence sitting



<P>in her mother's lap, as if being made `the baby' again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Certainly.&nbsp; Go, dear, I forgot that you have any home but



<P>this." And Mrs. March pressed the white hand that wore the wedding



<P>ring, as if asking pardon for her maternal covetousness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shouldn't have come over if I could have helped it, but



<P>I can't get on without my little woman any more than a..."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Weathercock can without the wind," suggested Jo, as he



<P>paused for a simile.&nbsp; Jo had grown quite her own saucy self



<P>again since Teddy came home.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Exactly, for Amy keeps me pointing due west most of the



<P>time, with only an occasional whiffle round to the south, and



<P>I haven't had an easterly spell since I was married.&nbsp; Don't know



<P>anything about the north, but am altogether salubrious and balmy,



<P>hey, my lady?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Lovely weather so far.&nbsp; I don't know how long it will last,



<P>but I'm not afraid of storms, for I'm learning how to sail my



<P>ship.&nbsp; Come home, dear, and I'll find your bootjack.&nbsp; I suppose



<P>that's what you are rummaging after among my things.&nbsp; Men are so



<P>helpless, Mother," said Amy, with a matronly air, which delighted



<P>her husband.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What are you going to do with yourselves after you get settled?"



<P>asked Jo, buttoning Amy's cloak as she used to button her pinafores.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We have our plans.&nbsp; We don't mean to say much about them



<P>yet, because we are such very new brooms, but we don't intend to



<P>be idle.&nbsp; I'm going into business with a devotion that shall delight



<P>Grandfather, and prove to him that I'm not spoiled.&nbsp; I need



<P>something of the sort to keep me steady.&nbsp; I'm tired of dawdling,



<P>and mean to work like a man."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And Amy, what is she going to do?" asked Mrs. March, well



<P>pleased at Laurie's decision and the energy with which he spoke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"After doing the civil all round, and airing our best bonnet,



<P>we shall astonish you by the elegant hospitalities of our mansion,



<P>the brilliant society we shall draw about us, and the beneficial



<P>influence we shall exert over the world at large.&nbsp; That's about



<P>it, isn't it, Madame Recamier?" asked Laurie with a quizzical



<P>look at Amy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Time will show.&nbsp; Come away, Impertinence, and don't shock



<P>my family by calling me names before their faces," answered Amy,



<P>resolving that there should be a home with a good wife in it



<P>before she set up a salon as a queen of society.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How happy those children seem together!" observed Mr. March,



<P>finding it difficult to become absorbed in his Aristotle after



<P>the young couple had gone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, and I think it will last," added Mrs. March, with the



<P>restful expression of a pilot who has brought a ship safely into



<P>port.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I know it will.&nbsp; Happy Amy!"&nbsp; And Jo sighed, then smiled



<P>brightly as Professor Bhaer opened the gate with an impatient



<P>push.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Later in the evening, when his mind had been set at rest



<P>about the bootjack, Laurie said suddenly to his wife, "Mrs.



<P>Laurence."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My Lord!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That man intends to marry our Jo!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hope so, don't you, dear?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, my love, I consider him a trump, in the fullest sense



<P>of that expressive word, but I do wish he was a little younger



<P>and a good deal richer."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now, Laurie, don't be too fastidious and worldly-minded.



<P>If they love one another it doesn't matter a particle how old



<P>they are nor how poor.&nbsp; Women never should marry for money..."



<P>Amy caught herself up short as the words escaped her, and looked



<P>at her husband, who replied, with malicious gravity...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Certainly not, though you do hear charming girls say that



<P>they intend to do it sometimes.&nbsp; If my memory serves me, you



<P>once thought it your duty to make a rich match.&nbsp; That accounts,



<P>perhaps, for your marrying a good-for-nothing like me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, my dearest boy, don't, don't say that!&nbsp; I forgot you



<P>were rich when I said `Yes'.&nbsp; I'd have married you if you hadn't



<P>a penny, and I sometimes wish you were poor that I might show



<P>how much I love you."&nbsp; And Amy, who was very dignified in public



<P>and very fond in private, gave convincing proofs of the truth of



<P>her words.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You don't really think I am such a mercenary creature as



<P>I tried to be once, do you?&nbsp; It would break my heart if you



<P>didn't believe that I'd gladly pull in the same boat with you,



<P>even if you had to get your living by rowing on the lake."2

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Am I an idiot and a brute?&nbsp; How could I think so, when



<P>you refused a richer man for me, and won't let me give you half



<P>I want to now, when I have the right?&nbsp; Girls do it every day,



<P>poor things, and are taught to think it is their only salvation,



<P>but you had better lessons, and though I trembled for you at



<P>one time, I was not disappointed, for the daughter was true to



<P>the mother's teaching.&nbsp; I told Mamma so yesterday, and she



<P>looked as glad and grateful as if I'd given her a check for a



<P>million, to be spent in charity.&nbsp; You are not listening to my



<P>moral remarks, Mrs. Laurence."&nbsp; And Laurie paused, for Amy's



<P>eyes had an absent look, though fixed upon his face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, I am, and admiring the mple in your chin at the



<P>same time.&nbsp; I don't wish to make you vain, but I must confess



<P>that I'm prouder of my handsome husband than of all his money.



<P>Don't laugh, but your nose is such a comfort to me." And Amy



<P>softly caressed the well-cut feature with artistic satisfaction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie had received many compliments in his life, but never



<P>one that suited him better, as he plainly showed though he did



<P>laugh at his wife's peculiar taste, while she said slowly, "May



<P>I ask you a question, dear?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Of course, you may."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Shall you care if Jo does marry Mr. Bhaer?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, that's the trouble is it?&nbsp; I thought there was something



<P>in the dimple that didn't quite suit you.&nbsp; Not being a dog in the



<P>manger, but the happiest fellow alive, I assure you I can dance



<P>at Jo's wedding with a heart as light as my heels.&nbsp; Do you doubt



<P>it, my darling?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy looked up at him, and was satisfied.&nbsp; Her little jealous



<P>fear vanished forever, and she thanked him, with a face full of



<P>love and confidence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wish we could do something for that capital old Professor.



<P>Couldn't we invent a rich relation, who shall obligingly die out



<P>there in Germany, and leave him a tidy little fortune?" said Laurie,



<P>when they began to pace up and down the long drawing room, arm in



<P>arm, as they were fond of doing, in memory of the chateau garden.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Jo would find us out, and spoil it all.&nbsp; She is very proud



<P>of him, just as he is, and said yesterday that she thought poverty



<P>was a beautiful thing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Bless her dear heart!&nbsp; She won't think so when she has a



<P>literary husband, and a dozen little professors and professorins



<P>to support.&nbsp; We won't interfere now, but watch our chance, and



<P>do them a good turn in spite of themselves.&nbsp; I owe Jo for a part



<P>of my education, and she believes in people's paying their honest



<P>debts, so I'll get round her in that way."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How delightful it is to be able to help others, isn't it?



<P>That was always one of my dreams, to have the power of giving



<P>freely, and thanks to you, the dream has come true."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, we'll do quantities of good, won't we?&nbsp; There's one



<P>sort of poverty that I particularly like to help.&nbsp; Out-and-out



<P>beggars get taken care of, but poor gentle folks fare badly,



<P>because they won't ask, and people don't dare to offer charity.



<P>Yet there are a thousand ways of helping them, if one only



<P>knows how to do it so delicately that it does not offend.&nbsp; I



<P>must say, I like to serve a decayed gentleman better than a



<P>blarnerying beggar.&nbsp; I suppose it's wrong, but I do, though it



<P>is harder."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Because it takes a gentleman to do it," added the other



<P>member of the domestic admiration society.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you, I'm afraid I don't deserve that pretty compliment.



<P>But I was going to say that while I was dawdling about abroad, I



<P>saw a good many talented young fellows making all sorts of sacrifices,



<P>and enduring real hardships, that they might realize their dreams.



<P>Splendid fellows, some of them, working like heros,&nbsp; poor



<P>and friendless, but so full of courage, patience, and ambition



<P>that I was ashamed of myself, and longed to give them a right



<P>good lift.&nbsp; Those are people whom it's a satisfaction to help,



<P>for if they've got genius, it's an honor to be allowed to



<P>serve them, and not let it be lost or delayed for want of fuel



<P>to keep the pot boiling.&nbsp; If they haven't, it's a pleasure to



<P>comfort the poor souls, and keep them from despair when they find



<P>it out."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, indeed, and there's another class who can't ask, and



<P>who suffer in silence.&nbsp; I know something of it, for I belonged

to



<P>it before you made a princess of me, as the king does the beggarmaid



<P>in the old story.&nbsp; Ambitious girls have a hard time, Laurie,



<P>and often have to see youth, health, and precious opportunities



<P>go by, just for want of a little help at the right minute.&nbsp; People



<P>have been very kind to me, and whenever I see girls struggling



<P>along, as we used to do, I want to put out my hand and help them,



<P>as I was helped."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And so you shall, like an angel as you are!" cried Laurie,



<P>resolving, with a glow of philanthropic zeal, to found and endow



<P>an institution for the express benefit of young women with



<P>artistic tendencies.&nbsp; "Rich people have no right to sit down



<P>and enjoy themselves, or let their money accumulate for others



<P>to waste.&nbsp; It's not half so sensible to leave legacies when one



<P>dies as it is to use the money wisely while alive, and enjoy



<P>making one's fellow creatures happy with it.&nbsp; We'll have a good



<P>time ourselves, and add an extra relish to our own pleasure by



<P>giving other people a generous taste.&nbsp; Will you be a little



<P>Dorcal, going about emptying a big basket of comforts, and



<P>filling it up with good deeds?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"With all my heart, if you will be a brave St. Martin,



<P>stopping as you ride gallantly through the world to share your



<P>cloak with the beggar."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's a bargain, and we shall get the best of it!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So the young pair shook hands upon it, and then paced



<P>happily on again, feeling that their pleasant home was more



<P>homelike because they hoped to brighten other homes, believing



<P>that their own feet would walk more uprightly along the flowery



<P>path before them, if they smoothed rough ways for other feet,



<P>and feeling that their hearts were more closely knit together



<P>by a love which could tenderly remember those less blest than they.

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At three o'clock in the afternoon, all the fashionable world



<P>at Nice may be seen on the Promenade des Anglais--a charming place,



<P>for the wide walk, bordered with palms, flowers, and tropical shrubs,



<P>is bounded on one side by the sea, on the other by the grand drive,



<P>lined with hotels and villas, while beyond lie orange orchards and



<P>the hills.&nbsp; Many nations are represented, many languages spoken,

many



<P>costumes worn, and on a sunny day the spectacle is as gay and brilliant



<P>as a carnival.&nbsp; Haughty English, lively French, sober Germans,



<P>handsome Spaniards, ugly Russians, meek Jews, free-and-easy Americans,



<P>all drive, sit, or saunter here, chatting over the news, and criticzing



<P>the latest celebrity who has arrived--Ristori or Dickens, Victor



<P>Emmanuel or the Queen of the Sandwich Islands.&nbsp; The equipages are

as



<P>varied as the company and attract as much attention, especially the



<P>low basket barouches in which ladies drive themselves, with a pair



<P>of dashing ponies, gay nets to keep their voluminous flounces from



<P>overflowing the diminutive vehicles, and little grooms on the perch



<P>behind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Along this walk, on Christmas Day, a tall young man walked



<P>slowly, with his hands behind him, and a somewhat absent expression



<P>of countenance.&nbsp; He looked like an Italian, was dressed like an



<P>Englishman, and had the independent air of an American--a combination



<P>which caused sundry pairs of feminine eyes to look approvingly



<P>after him, and sundry dandies in black velvet suits, with



<P>rose-colored neckties, buff gloves, and orange flowers in their



<P>buttonholes, to shrug their shoulders, and then envy him his inches.



<P>There were plenty of pretty faces to admire, but the young man took



<P>little notice of them, except to glance now and then at some blonde



<P>girl in blue.&nbsp; Presently he strolled out of the promenade and



<P>stood a moment at the crossing, as if undecided whether to go and



<P>listen to the band in the Jardin Publique, or to wander along the



<P>beach toward Castle Hill.&nbsp; The quick trot of ponies feet made him



<P>look up, as one of the little carriages, containing a single



<P>young lady, came rapidly down the street.&nbsp; The lady was young,



<P>blonde, and dressed in blue.&nbsp; He stared a minute, then his whole



<P>face woke up, and, waving his hat like a boy, he hurried forward



<P>to meet her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, Laurie, is it really you?&nbsp; I thought you'd never come!"



<P>cried Amy, dropping the reins and holding out both hands, to the



<P>great scandalization of a French mamma, who hastened her daughter's



<P>steps, lest she should be demoralized by beholding the free manners



<P>of these `mad English'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was detained by the way, but I promised to spend Christmas



<P>with you, and here I am."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How is your grandfather?&nbsp; When did you come?&nbsp; Where are you



<P>staying?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very well--last night--at the Chauvain.&nbsp; I called at your



<P>hotel, but you were out."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have so much to say, I don't know where to begin!&nbsp; Get



<P>in and we can talk at our ease.&nbsp; I was going for a drive and



<P>longing for company.&nbsp; Flo's saving up for tonight."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What happens then, a ball?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A Christmas party at out hotel.&nbsp; There are many Americans



<P>there, and they give it in honor of the day.&nbsp; You'll go with us,



<P>of course?&nbsp; Aunt will be charmed."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you.&nbsp; Where now?" asked Laurie, leaning back and



<P>folding his arms, a proceeding which suited Amy, who preferred



<P>to drive, for her parasol whip and blue reins over the white



<P>ponies backs afforded her infinite satisfaction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm going to the bankers first for letters, and then to



<P>Castle Hill.&nbsp; The view is so lovely, and I like to feed the peacocks.



<P>Have you ever been there?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Often, years ago, but I don't mind having a look at it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now tell me all about yourself.&nbsp; The last I heard of you,



<P>your grandfather wrote that he expected you from Berlin."



<P>"Yes, I spent a month there and then joined him in Paris,



<P>where he has settled for the winter.&nbsp; He has friends there and



<P>finds plenty to amuse him, so I go and come, and we got on capitally."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's a sociable arrangement," said Amy, missing something



<P>in Laurie's manner, though she couldn't tell what.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, you see, he hates to travel, and I hate to keep still,



<P>so we each suit ourselves, and there is no trouble.&nbsp; I am often



<P>with him, and he enjoys my adventures, while I like to feel that



<P>someone is glad to see me when I get back from my wanderings.&nbsp;

Dirty



<P>old hole, isn't it?" he added, with a look of disgust as they drove



<P>along the boulevard to the Place Napoleon in the old city.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The dirt is picturesque, so I don't mind.&nbsp; The river and the



<P>hills are delicious, and these glimpses of the narrow cross streets



<P>are my delight.&nbsp; Now we shall have to wait for that procession

to



<P>pass.&nbsp; It's going to the Church of St. John."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While Laurie listlessly watched the procession of priests



<P>under their canopies, white-veiled nuns bearing lighted tapers,



<P>and some brotherhood in blue chanting as they walked, Amy watched



<P>him, and felt a new sort of shyness steal over her, for he was



<P>changed, and she could not find the merry-faced boy she left in



<P>the moody-looking man beside her.&nbsp; He was handsomer than ever and



<P>greatly improved, she thought, but now that the flush of pleasure



<P>at meeting her was over, he looked tired and spiritless--not sick,



<P>nor exactly unhappy, but older and graver than a year or two of



<P>prosperous life should have made him.&nbsp; She couldn't understand

it



<P>and did not venture to ask questions, so she shook her head and



<P>touched up her ponies, as the procession wound away across the



<P>arches of the Paglioni bridge and vanished in the church.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Que pensez-vous?" she said, airing her French, which had



<P>improved in quantity, if not in quality, since she came abroad.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That mademoiselle has made good use of her time, and the



<P>result is charming," replied Laurie, bowing with his hand on



<P>his heart and an admiring look.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She blushed with pleasure, but somehow the compliment did



<P>not satisfy her like the blunt praises he used to give her at



<P>home, when he promenaded round her on festival occasions, and



<P>tole her she was `altogether jolly', with a hearty smile and an



<P>approving pat on the head.&nbsp; She didn't like the new tone, for



<P>though not blase, it sounded indifferent in spite of the look.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If that's the way he's going to grow up, I wish he's stay



<P>a boy," she thought, with a curious sense of disappointment and



<P>discomfort, trying meantime to seem quite easy and gay.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At Avigdor's she found the precious home letters and, giving



<P>the reins to Laurie, read them luxuriously as they wound up the



<P>shady road between green hedges, where tea roses bloomed as freshly



<P>as in June.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Beth is very poorly, Mother says.&nbsp; I often think I ought to



<P>go home, but they all say `stay'.&nbsp; So I do, for I shall never have



<P>another chance like this," said Amy, looking sober over one page.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think you are right, there.&nbsp; You could do nothing at home,



<P>and it is a great comfort to them to know that you are well and



<P>happy, and enjoying so much, my dear."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He drew a little nearer, and looked more like his old self as



<P>he said that, and the fear that sometimes weighed on Amy's heart



<P>was lightened, for the look, the act, the brotherly `my dear',



<P>seemed to assure her that if any trouble did come, she would not



<P>be alone in a strange land.&nbsp; Presently she laughed and showed him



<P>a small sketch of Jo in her scribbling suit, with the bow rampantly



<P>erect upon her cap, and issuing from her mouth the words, `Genius



<P>burns!'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie smiled, took it, put it in his vest pocket `to keep it



<P>from blowing away', and listened with interest to the lively letter



<P>Amy read him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This will be a regularly merry Christmas to me, with presents



<P>in the morning, you and letters in the afternoon, and a party at



<P>night," said Amy, as they alighted among the ruins of the old fort,



<P>and a flock of splendid peacocks came trooping about them, tamely



<P>waiting to be fed.&nbsp; While Amy stood laughing on the bank above

him



<P>as she scattered crumbs to the brilliant birds, Laurie looked at her



<P>as she had looked at him, with a natural curiosity to see what



<P>changes time and absence had wrought.&nbsp; He found nothing to perplex



<P>or disappoint, much to admire and approve, for overlooking a few



<P>little affectations of speech and manner, she was as sprightly and



<P>graceful as ever, with the addition of that indescribable something



<P>in dress and bearing which we call elegance.&nbsp; Always mature for

her



<P>age, she had gained a certain aplomb in both carriage and conversation,



<P>which made her seem more of a woman of the world than she was, but



<P>her old petulance now and then showed itself, her strong will still



<P>held its own, and her native frankness was unspoiled by foreign



<P>polish.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie did not read all this while he watched her feed the peacocks,



<P>but he saw enough to satisfy and interest him, and carried



<P>away a pretty little picture of a bright-faced girl standing in the



<P>sunshine, which brought out the soft hue of her dress, the fresh



<P>color of her cheeks, the golden gloss of her hair, and made her a



<P>prominent figure in the pleasant scene.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As they came up onto the stone plateau that crowns the hill,



<P>Amy waved her hand as if welcoming him to her favorite haunt, and



<P>said, pointing here and there, "Do you remember the Cathedral and



<P>the Corso, the fishermen dragging their nets in the bay, and the



<P>lovely road to Villa Franca, Schubert's Tower, just below, and best



<P>of all, that speck far out to sea which they say ils Corsica?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I remember.&nbsp; It's not much changed," he answered without



<P>enthusiasm.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What Jo would give for a sight of that famous speck!" said



<P>Amy, feeling in good spirits and anxious to see him so also.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," was all he said, but he turned and strained his eyes to



<P>see the island which a greater usurper than even Napoleon now made



<P>interesting in his sight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Take a good look at it for her sake, and then come and tell



<P>me what you have been doing with yourself all this while," said



<P>Amy, seating herself, ready for a good talk.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But she did not get it, for though he joined her and answered



<P>all her questions freely, she could only learn that he had roved



<P>about the Continent and been to Greece.&nbsp; So after idling away an



<P>hour, they drove home again, and having paid his respects to Mrs.



<P>Carrol, Laurie left them, promising to return in the evening.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It must be recorded of Amy that she deliberately prinked that



<P>night.&nbsp; Time and absence had done its work on both the young people.



<P>She had seen her old friend in a new light, not as `our boy', but as



<P>a handsome and agreeable man, and she was conscious of a very natural



<P>desire to find favor in his sight.&nbsp; Amy knew her good points, and



<P>made the most of them with the taste and skill which is a fortune to



<P>a poor and pretty woman.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Tarlatan and tulle were cheap at Nice, so she enveloped herself



<P>in them on such occasions, and following the sensible English fashion



<P>of simple dress for young girls, got up charming little toilettes



<P>with fresh flowers, a few trinkets, and all manner of dainty devices,



<P>which were both inexpensive and effective.&nbsp; It must be confessed



<P>that the artist sometimes got possession of the woman, and indulged



<P>in antique coiffures, statuesque attitudes, and classic draperies.



<P>But, dear heart, we all have out little weaknesses, and find it



<P>easy to pardon such in the young, who satisfy our eyes with their



<P>comeliness, and keep our hearts merry with their artless vanities.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do want him to think I look well, and tell them so at home,"



<P>said Amy to herself, as she put on Flo's old white silk ball dress,



<P>and covered it with a cloud of fresh illusion, out of which her



<P>white shoulders and golden head emerged with a most artistic effect.



<P>Her hair she had the sense to let alone, after gathering up the



<P>thick waves and curls into a Hebe-like knot at the back of her head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's not the fashion, but it's becoming, and I can't afford to



<P>make a fright of myself," she used to say, when advised to frizzle,



<P>puff, or braid, as the latest style commanded.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Having no ornaments fine enough for this important occasion,



<P>Amy looped her fleecy skirts with rosy clusters of azalea, and



<P>framed the white shoulders in delicate green vines.&nbsp; Remembering



<P>the painted boots, she surveyed her white satin slippers with



<P>girlish satisfaction, and chassed down the room, admiring her



<P>aristocratic feet all by herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My new fan just matches my flowers, my gloves fit to a charm,



<P>and the real lace on Aunt's mouchoir gives an air to my whole dress.



<P>If I only had a classical nose and mouth I should be perfectly happy,"



<P>she said, surveying herself with a critical eye and a candle in



<P>each hand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In spite of this affliction, she looked unusually gay and



<P>graceful as she glided away.&nbsp; She seldom ran--it did not suit her



<P>style, she thought, for being tall, the stately and Junoesque was



<P>more appropriate than the sportive or piquante.&nbsp; She walked up

and



<P>down the long saloon while waiting for Laurie, and once arranged



<P>herself under the chandelier, which had a good effect upon her



<P>hair, then she thought better of it, and went away to the other



<P>end of the room, as if ashamed of the girlish desire to have the



<P>first view a propitious one.&nbsp; It so happened that she could not



<P>have done a better thing, for Laurie came in so quietly she



<P>did not hear him, and as she stood at the distant window, with



<P>her head half turned and one hand gathering up her dress, the



<P>slender, white figure against the red curtains was as effective



<P>as a well-placed statue.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Good evening, Diana!" said Laurie, with the look of satisfaction



<P>she liked to see in his eyes when they rested on her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Good evening, Apollo!" she answered, smiling back at him,



<P>for he too looked unusually debonair, and the thought of



<P>entering the ballroom on the arm of such a personable man



<P>caused Amy to pity the four plain Misses Davis from the bottom



<P>of her heart.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here are your flowers.&nbsp; I arranged them myself, remembering



<P>that you didn't like what Hannah calls a `sot-bookay', said



<P>Laurie, handing her a delicate nosegay, in a holder that she



<P>had long coveted as she daily passed it in Cardiglia's window.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How kind you are!" she exclaimed gratefully.&nbsp; "If I'd



<P>known you were coming I'd have had something ready for you today,



<P>though not as pretty as this, I'm afraid."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you.&nbsp; It isn't what it should be, but you have improved

it,"



<P>he added, as she snapped the silver bracelet on her wrist.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Please don't."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I thought you liked that sort of thing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not from you, it doesn't sound natural, and I like your



<P>old bluntness better."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm glad of it," he answered, with a look of relief, then



<P>buttoned her gloves for her, and asked if his tie was straight,



<P>just as he used to do when they went to parties together at home.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The company assembled in the long salle a manger that



<P>evening was such as one sees nowhere but on the Continent.&nbsp; The



<P>hospitable Americans had invited every acquaintance they had



<P>in Nice, and having no prejudice against titles, secured a few



<P>to add luster to their Christmas ball.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A Russian prince condescended to sit in a corner for an



<P>hour and talk with a massive lady, dressed like Hamlet's mother



<P>in black velvet with a pearl bridle under her chin.&nbsp; A Polish



<P>count, aged eighteen, devoted himself to the ladies, who pronounced



<P>him, `a fascinating dear', and a German Serene Something,



<P>having come to supper alone, roamed vaguely about, seeking what



<P>he might devour.&nbsp; Baron Rothschild's private secretary, a largenosed



<P>Jew in tight boots, affably beamed upon the world, as if



<P>his master's name crowned him with a golden halo.&nbsp; A stout



<P>Frenchman, who knew the Emperor, came to indulge his mania for



<P>dancing, and Lady de Jones, a British matron, adorned the scene



<P>with her little family of eight.&nbsp; Of course, there were many



<P>light-footed, shrill-voiced American girls, handsome, lifeless-looking



<P>English ditto, and a few plain but piquante French demoiselles,



<P>likewise the usual set of traveling young gentlemen



<P>who disported themselves gaily, while mammas of all nations



<P>lined the walls and smiled upon them benignly when they danced



<P>with their daughters.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Any young girl can imagine Amy's state of mind when she



<P>`took the stage' that night, leaning on Laurie's arm.&nbsp; She



<P>knew she looked well, she loved to dance, she felt that her



<P>foot was on her native heath in a ballroom, and enjoyed the



<P>delightful sense of power which comes when young girls first



<P>discover the new and lovely kingdom they are born to rule by



<P>virtue of beauty, youth, and womanhood.&nbsp; She did pity the



<P>Davis girls, who were awkward, plain, and destitute of escort,



<P>except a grim papa and three grimmer maiden aunts, and she



<P>bowed to them in her friendliest manner as she passed, which



<P>was good of her, as it permitted them to see her dress, and



<P>burn with curiosity to know who her distinguished-looking



<P>friend might be.&nbsp; With the first burst of the band, Amy's



<P>color rose, her eyes began to sparkle, and her feet to tap the



<P>floor impatiently, for she danced well and wanted Laurie to



<P>know it.&nbsp; Therefore the shock she received can better be



<P>imagined than described, when he said in a perfectly tranquil



<P>tone, "Do you care to dance?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"One usually does at a ball."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her amazed look and quick answer caused Laurie to repair



<P>his error as fast as possible.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I meant the first dance.&nbsp; May I have the honor?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I can give you one if I put off the Count.&nbsp; He dances



<P>devinely, but he will excuse me, as you are an old friend," said



<P>Amy, hoping that the name would have a good effect, and show



<P>Laurie that she was not to be trifled with.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nice little boy, but rather a short Pole to support .&nbsp; ..



<P>A daughter of the gods,



<P>Devinely tall, and most devinely fair,"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>was all the satisfaction she got, however.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The set in which they found themselves was composed of



<P>English, and Amy was compelled to walk decorously through a



<P>cotillion, feeling all the while as if she could dance the



<P>tarantella with relish.&nbsp; Laurie resigned her to the `nice little



<P>boy', and went to do his duty to Flo, without securing Amy for



<P>the joys to come, which reprehensible want of forethought was



<P>properly punished, for she immediately engaged herself till



<P>supper, meaning to relent if he then gave any signs penitence.



<P>She showed him her ball book with demure satisfaction when he



<P>strolled instead of rushed up to claim her for the next, a



<P>glorious polka redowa.&nbsp; But his polite regrets didn't impose



<P>upon her, and when she galloped away with the Count, she saw



<P>Laurie sit down by her aunt with an actual expression of relief.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That was unpardonable, and Amy took no more notice of him



<P>for a long while, except a word now and then when she came to



<P>her chaperon between the dances for a necessary pin or a



<P>moment's rest.&nbsp; Her anger had a good effect, however, for she



<P>hid it under a smiling face, and seemed unusually blithe and



<P>brilliant.&nbsp; Laurie's eyes followed her with pleasure, for she



<P>neither romped nor sauntered, but danced with spirit and



<P>grace, making the delightsome pastime what it should be.&nbsp; He



<P>very naturally fell to studying her from this new point of



<P>view, and before the evening was half over, had decided that



<P>`little Amy was going to make a very charming woman'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was a lively scene, for soon the spirit of the social



<P>season took possession of everyone, and Christmas merriment made



<P>all faces shine, hearts happy, and heels light.&nbsp; The musicians



<P>fiddled, tooted, and banged as if they enjoyed it, everybody



<P>danced who could, and those who couldn't admired their



<P>neighbors with uncommon warmth.&nbsp; The air was dark with Davises,



<P>and many Jones gamboled like a flock of young giraffes.&nbsp; The



<P>golden secretary darted through the room like a meteor with



<P>a dashing frenchwoman who carped the floor with her pink satin



<P>train.&nbsp; The serene Teuton found the supper table and was happy,



<P>eating steadily through the bill of fare, and dismayed the



<P>garcons by the ravages he committed.&nbsp; But the Emperor's friend



<P>covered himself with glory, for he danced everything, whether



<P>he knew it or not, and introduced impromptu pirouettes when the



<P>figures bewildered him.&nbsp; The boyish abandon of that stout man



<P>was charming to behold, for though he `carried weight', he



<P>danced like an India-rubber ball.&nbsp; He ran, he flew, he pranced,



<P>his face glowed, his bald head shown, his coattails waved wildly,



<P>his pumps actually twinkled in the air, and when the music



<P>stopped, he wiped the drops from his brow, and beamed upon his



<P>fellow men like a French Pickwick without glasses.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy and her Pole distinguished themselves by equal enthusiasm



<P>but more graceful agility, and Laurie found himself



<P>involuntarily keeping time to the rhythmic rise and fall of the



<P>white slippers as they flew by as indefatigably as if winged.



<P>When little Vladimir finally relinquished her, with assurances



<P>that he was `desolated to leave so early', she was ready to



<P>rest, and see how her recreant knight had borne his punishment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It had been successful, for at three-and-twenty, blighted



<P>affections find a balm in friendly society, and young nerves



<P>will thrill, young blood dance, and healthy young spirits rise,



<P>when subjected to the enchantment of beauty, light, music, and



<P>motion.&nbsp; Laurie had a waked-up look as he rose to give her his



<P>seat, and when he hurried away to bring her some supper, she



<P>said to herself, with a satisfied smile, "Ah, I thought that



<P>would do him good!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You look like Balzac's `FEMME PEINTE PAR ELLE-NENE',"



<P>he said, as he fanned her with one hand and held her coffee



<P>cup in the other.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My rouge won't come off." And Amy rubbed her brilliant



<P>cheek, and showed him her white glove with a sober simplicity



<P>that made him laugh outright.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What do you call this stuff?" he asked, touching a fold



<P>of her dress that had blown over his knee.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Illusion."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Good name for it.&nbsp; It's very pretty--new thing, isn't it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's as old as the hills.&nbsp; You have seen it on dozens of



<P>girls, and you never found out that it was pretty till now?



<P>Stupide!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I never saw it on you before, which accounts for the mistake,



<P>you see."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"None of that, it is forbidden.&nbsp; I'd rather take coffee



<P>than compliments just now.&nbsp; No, don't lounge, it makes me nervous."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie sat bold upright, and meekly took her empty plate



<P>feeling an odd sort of pleasure in having `little Amy' order



<P>him about, for she had lost her shyness now, and felt an



<P>irrestible desire to trample on him, as girls have a delightful



<P>way of doing when lords of creation show any signs of subjection.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Where did you learn all this sort of thing?" he asked with



<P>a quizzical look.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"As `this sort of thing' is rather a vague expression, would



<P>you kindly explain?" returned Amy, knowing perfectly well what he



<P>meant, but wickedly leaving him to describe what is indescribable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well--the general air, the style, the self-possession, the--



<P>the--illusion--you know", laughed Laurie, breaking down and helping



<P>himself out of his quandary with the new word.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy was gratified, but of course didn't show it, and demurely



<P>answered, "Foreign life polishes one in spite of one's self.&nbsp; I



<P>study as well as play, and as for this"--with a little gesture



<P>toward her dress--"why, tulle is cheap, posies to be had for



<P>nothing, and I am used to making the most of my poor little things."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy rather regretted that last sentence, fearing it wasn't in



<P>good taste, but Laurie liked her better for it, and found himself



<P>both admiring and respecting the brave patience that made the most



<P>of opportunity, and the cheerful spirit that covered poverty with



<P>flowers.&nbsp; Amy did not know why he looked at her so kindly, now



<P>why he filled up her book with his own name, and devoted himself



<P>to her for the rest of the evening in the most delightful manner,



<P>but the impulse that wrought this agreeable change was the result



<P>of one of the new impressions which both of them were unconsciously



<P>giving and receiving.

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Like bees swarming after their queen, mother and daughters



<P>hovered about Mr. March the next day, neglecting everything to



<P>look at, wait upon, and listen to the new invalid, who was in a



<P>fair way to be killed by kindness.&nbsp; As he sat propped up in a



<P>big chair by Beth's sofa, with the other three close by, and



<P>Hannah popping in her head now and then `to peek at the dear



<P>man', nothing seemed needed to complete their happiness.&nbsp; But



<P>something was needed, and the elder ones felt it, though none



<P>confessed the fact.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. March looked at one another



<P>with an anxious expression, as their eyes followed Meg.&nbsp; Jo



<P>had sudden fits of sobriety, and was seen to shake her fist at



<P>Mr. Brooke's umbrella, which had been left in the hall.&nbsp; Meg



<P>was absent-minded, shy, and silent, started when the bell rang,



<P>and colored when John's name was mentioned.&nbsp; Amy said,



<P>"Everyone seemed waiting for something, and couldn't settle down,



<P>which was queer, since Father was safe at home," and Beth innocently



<P>wondered why their neighbors didn't run over as usual.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie went by in the afternoon, and seeing Meg at the window,



<P>seemed suddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit, for he fell



<P>down on one knee in the snow, beat his breast, tore his hair,



<P>and clasped his hands imploringly, as if begging some boon.



<P>And when Meg told him to behave himself and go away, he wrung



<P>imaginary tears out of his handkerchief, and staggered round the



<P>corner as if in utter despair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What does the goose mean?" said Meg, laughing and trying to



<P>look unconscious.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He's showing you how your John will go on by-and-by.



<P>Touchin, isn't it?" answered Jo scornfully.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't say my John, it isn't proper or true," but Meg's voice



<P>lingered over the words as if they sounded pleasant to her.&nbsp; "Please



<P>don't plague me, Jo, I've told you I don't care much about him, and



<P>there isn't to be anything said, but we are all to be friendly, and



<P>go on as before."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We can't, for something has been said, and Laurie's mischief



<P>has spoiled you for me.&nbsp; I see it, and so does Mother.&nbsp; You

are not



<P>like your old self a bit, and seem ever so far away from me.&nbsp; I



<P>don't mean to plague you and will bear it like a man, but I do wish



<P>it was all settled.&nbsp; I hate to wait, so if you mean ever to do

it,



<P>make haste and have it over quickly," said Jo pettishly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I can't say anything till he speaks, and he won't, because



<P>Father said I was too young," began Meg, bending over her work



<P>with a queer little smile, which suggested that she did not quite



<P>agree with her father on that point.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If he did speak, you wouldn't know what to say, but would



<P>cry or blush, or let him have his own way, instead of giving a



<P>good, decided no."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm not so silly and weak as you think.&nbsp; I know just what



<P>I should say, for I've planned it all, so I needn't be taken



<P>unawares.&nbsp; There's no knowing what may happen, and I wished to



<P>be prepared."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo couldn't help smiling at the important air which Meg had



<P>unconsciously assumed and which was as becoming as the pretty



<P>color varying in her cheeks.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Would you mind telling me what you'd say?" asked Jo more



<P>respectfully.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not at all.&nbsp; You are sixteen now, quite old enough to be



<P>my confidente, and my experience will be useful to you by-and-by,



<P>perhaps, in your own affairs of this sort."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't mean to have any.&nbsp; It's fun to watch other people



<P>philander, but I should feel like a fool doing it myself," said



<P>Jo, looking alarmed at the thought.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think not, if you liked anyone very much, and he liked



<P>you."&nbsp; Meg spoke as if to herself, and glanced out at the lane



<P>where she had often seen lovers walking together in the summer



<P>twilight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I thought you were going to tell your speech to that man,"



<P>said Jo, rudely shortening her sister's little reverie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, I should merely say, quite calmly and decidedly, `Thank



<P>you, Mr. Brooke, you are very kind, but I agree with Father that



<P>I am too young to enter into any engagement at present, so please



<P>say no more, but let us be friends as we were."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hum, that's stiff and cool enough!&nbsp; I don't believe you'll



<P>ever say it, and I know he won't be satisfied if you do.&nbsp; If he



<P>goes on like the rejected lovers in books, you'll give in, rather



<P>than hurt his feelings."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I won't.&nbsp; I shall tell him I've made up my mind, and



<P>shall walk out of the room with dignity."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg rose as she spoke, and was just going to rehearse the



<P>dignified exit, when a step in the hall made her fly into her



<P>seat and begin to sew as fast as if her life depended on finishing



<P>that particular seam in a given time.&nbsp; Jo smothered a laugh



<P>at the sudden change, and when someone gave a modest tap, opened



<P>the door with a grim aspect which was anything but hospitable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Good afternoon.&nbsp; I came to get my umbrella, that is, to see



<P>how your father finds himself today," said Mr. Brooke, getting a



<P>trifle confused as his eyes went from one telltale face to the other.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's very well, he's in the rack.&nbsp; I'll get him, and tell it



<P>you are here."&nbsp; And having jumbled her father and the umbrella

well



<P>together in her reply, Jo slipped out of the room to give Meg a



<P>chance to make her speech and air her dignity.&nbsp; But the instant

she



<P>vanished, Meg began to sidle toward the door, murmuring...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mother will like to see you.&nbsp; Pray sit down, I'll call her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't go.&nbsp; Are you afraid of me, Margaret?" And Mr. Brooke



<P>looked so hurt that Meg thought she must have done something very



<P>rude.&nbsp; She blushed up to the little curls on her forehead, for

he



<P>had never called her Margaret before, and she was surprised to



<P>find how natural and sweet it seemed to hear him say it.&nbsp; Anxious



<P>to appear friendly and at her ease, she put out her hand with a



<P>confiding gesture, and said gratefully...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How can I be afraid when you have been so kind to Father?



<P>I only wish I could thank you for it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Shall I tell you how?" asked Mr. Brooke, holding the small



<P>hand fast in both his own, and looking down at Meg with so much



<P>love in the brown eyes that her heart began to flutter, and she



<P>both longed to run away and to stop and listen.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh no, please don't, I'd rather not," she said, trying to



<P>withdraw her hand, and looking frightened in spite of her denial.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I won't trouble you.&nbsp; I only want to know if you care for



<P>me a little, Meg.&nbsp; I love you so much, dear," added Mr. Brooke



<P>tenderly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was the moment for the calm, proper speech, but Meg



<P>didn't make it.&nbsp; She forgot every word of it, hung her head, and



<P>answered, "I don't know," so softly that John had to stoop down



<P>to catch the foolish little reply.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He seemed to think it was worth the trouble, for he smiled



<P>to himself as if quite satisfied, pressed the plump hand



<P>gratefully, and said in his most persuasive tone, "Will you try and



<P>find out?&nbsp; I want to know so much, for I can't go to work with



<P>any heart until I learn whether I am to have my reward in the end



<P>or not."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm too young," faltered Meg, wondering was she was so



<P>fluttered, yet rather enjoying it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll wait, and in the meantime, you could be learning to



<P>like me.&nbsp; Would it be a very hard lesson, dear?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not if I chose to learn it, but. . ."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Please choose to learn, Meg.&nbsp; I love you to teach, and this



<P>is easier than German," broke in John, getting possession of the



<P>other hand, so that she had no way of hiding her face as he bent



<P>to look into it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His tone was properly beseeching, but stealing a shy look



<P>at him, Meg saw that his eyes were merry as well as tender, and



<P>that he wore the satisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his



<P>success.&nbsp; This nettled her.&nbsp; Annie Moffat's foolish lessons

in



<P>coquetry came into her mind, and the love of power, which sleeps



<P>in the bosoms of the best of little women, woke up all of a



<P>sudden and took possession of her.&nbsp; She felt excited and



<P>strange, and not knowing what else to do, followed a



<P>capricious impulse, and, withdrawing her hands, said petulantly,



<P>"I don't choose.&nbsp; Please go away and let me be!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Poor Mr. Brooke looked as if his lovely castle in the air



<P>was tumbling about his ears, for he had never seen Meg in such



<P>a mood before, and it rather bewildered him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you really mean that?" he asked anxiously, following



<P>her as she walked away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, I do.&nbsp; I don't want to be worried about such things.



<P>Father says I needn't, it's too soon and I'd rather not."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mayn't I hope you'll change your mind by-and-by?&nbsp; I'll



<P>wait and say nothing till you have had more time.&nbsp; Don't play



<P>with me, Meg.&nbsp; I didn't think that of you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't think of me at all.&nbsp; I'd rather you wouldn't," said



<P>Meg, taking a naughty satisfaction in trying her lover's patience



<P>and her own power.



<P>He was grave and pale now, and looked decidedly more like



<P>the novel heroes whom she admired, but he neither slapped his



<P>forehead nor tramped about the room as they did.&nbsp; He just stood



<P>looking at her so wistfully, so tenderly, that she found her



<P>heart relenting in spite of herself.&nbsp; What would have happened



<P>next I cannot say, if Aunt March had not come hobbling in at



<P>this interesting minute.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The old lady couldn't resist her longing to see her nephew,



<P>for she had met Laurie as she took her airing, and hearing of



<P>Mr. March's arrival, drove straight out to see him.&nbsp; The family



<P>were all busy in the back part of the house, and she had made



<P>her way quietly in, hoping to surprise them.&nbsp; She did surprise



<P>two of them so much that Meg started as if she had seen a



<P>ghost, and Mr. Brooke vanished into the study.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Bless me, what's all this?" cried the old lady with a rap



<P>of her cane as she glanced from the pale young gentleman to the



<P>scarlet young lady.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's Father's friend.&nbsp; I'm so surprised to see you!" stammered

Meg,



<P>feeling that she was in for a lecture now.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's evident," returned Aunt March, sitting down.&nbsp; "But



<P>what is Father's friend saying to make you look like a peony?



<P>There's mischief going on, and I insist upon knowing what it



<P>is," with another rap.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We were only talking.&nbsp; Mr. Brooke came for his umbrella,"



<P>began Meg, wishing that Mr. Brooke and the umbrella were safely



<P>out of the house.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Brooke?&nbsp; That boy's tutor?&nbsp; Ah! I understand now.&nbsp; I

know



<P>all about it.&nbsp; Jo blundered into a wrong message in one of your



<P>Father's letters, and I made her tell me.&nbsp; You haven't gone and



<P>accepted him, child?" cried Aunt March, looking scandalized.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hush! He'll hear.&nbsp; Shan't I call Mother?" said Meg, much



<P>troubled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not yet.&nbsp; I've something to say to you, and I must free my



<P>mind at once.&nbsp; Tell me, do you mean to marry this Cook?&nbsp; If

you



<P>do, not one penny of my money ever goes to you.&nbsp; Remember that,



<P>and be a sensible girl," said the old lady impressively.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now Aunt March possessed in perfection the art of rousing



<P>the spirit of opposition in the gentlest people, and enjoyed



<P>doing it.&nbsp; The best of us have a spice of perversity in us,



<P>especially when we are young and in love.&nbsp; If Aunt March had



<P>begged Meg to accept John Brooke, she would probably have



<P>declared she couldn't think of it, but as she was preemptorily



<P>ordered not to like him, she immediately made up her mind that



<P>she would.&nbsp; Inclination as well as perversity made the decision



<P>easy, and being already much excited, Meg opposed the old lady



<P>with unusual spirit.



<P>"I shall marry whom I please, Aunt March, and you can



<P>leave your money to anyone you like," she said, nodding her



<P>head with a resolute air.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Highty-tighty!&nbsp; Is that the way you take my advice, Miss?



<P>You'll be sorry for it by-and-by, when you've tried love in a



<P>cottage and found it a failure."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It can't be a worse one than some people find in big



<P>houses," retorted Meg.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Aunt March put on her glasses and took a look at the girl,



<P>for she did not know her in this new mood.&nbsp; Meg hardly knew



<P>herself, she felt so brave and independent, so glad to defend



<P>John and assert her right to love him, if she liked.&nbsp; Aunt March



<P>saw that she had begun wrong, and after a little pause, made a



<P>fresh start, saying as mildly as she could, "Now, Meg, my dear,



<P>be reasonable and take my advice.&nbsp; I mean it kindly, and don't



<P>want you to spoil your whole life by making a mistake at the



<P>beginning.&nbsp; You ought to marry well and help your family.&nbsp;

It's



<P>your duty to make a rich match and it ought to be impressed



<P>upon you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Father and Mother don't think so.&nbsp; They like John though



<P>he is poor."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your parents, my dear, have no more worldly wisdom than a



<P>pair of babies."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm glad of it," cried Meg stoutly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Aunt March took no notice, but went on with her lecture.



<P>"This Rook is poor and hasn't got any rich relations, has he?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, but he has many warm friends."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You can't live on friends, try it and see how cool they'll



<P>grow.&nbsp; He hasn't any business, has he?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not yet.&nbsp; Mr. Laurence is going to help him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That won't last long.&nbsp; James Laurence is a crotchety old



<P>fellow and not to be depended on.&nbsp; So you intend to marry a man



<P>without money, position, or business, and go on working harder



<P>than you do now, when you might be comfortable all your days



<P>by minding me and doing better?&nbsp; I thought you had more sense,



<P>Meg."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I couldn't do better if I waited half my life!&nbsp; John is



<P>good and wise, he's got heaps of talent, he's willing to work



<P>and sure to get on, he's so energetic and brave.&nbsp; Everyone likes



<P>and respects him, and I'm proud to think he cares for me, though



<P>I'm so poor and young and silly," said Meg, looking prettier than



<P>ever in her earnestness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He knows you have got rich relations, child.&nbsp; That's the



<P>secret of his liking, I suspect."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Aunt March, how dare you say such a thing?&nbsp; John is above



<P>such meanness, and I won't listen to you a minute if you talk so,"



<P>cried Meg indignantly, forgetting everything but the injustice of



<P>the old lady's suspicions.&nbsp; "My John wouldn't marry for money,

any



<P>more than I would.&nbsp; We are willing to work and we mean to wait.&nbsp;

I'm



<P>not afraid of being poor, for I've been happy so far, and I know I



<P>shall be with him because he loves me, and I..."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg stopped there, remembering all of a sudden that she hadn't



<P>made up her mind, that she had told `her John' to go away, and that



<P>he might be overhearing her inconsistent remarks.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Aunt March was very angry, for she had set her heart on having



<P>her pretty niece make a fine match, and something in the girl's



<P>happy young face made the lonely old woman feel both sad and sour.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I wash my hands of the whole affair!&nbsp; You are a willful



<P>child, and you've lost more than you know by this piece of folly.



<P>No, I won't stop.&nbsp; I'm disappointed in you, and haven't spirits

to



<P>see your father now.&nbsp; Don't expect anything from me when you are



<P>married.&nbsp; Your Mr. Book's friends must take care of you.&nbsp;

I'm done



<P>with you forever."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And slamming the door in Meg's face, Aunt March drove off in



<P>high dudgeon.&nbsp; She seemed to take all the girl's courage with her,



<P>for when left alone, Meg stood for a moment, undecided whether to



<P>laugh or cry.&nbsp; Before she could make up her mind, she was taken



<P>possession of by Mr. Brooke, who said all in one breath, "I couldn't



<P>help hearing, Meg.&nbsp; Thank you for defending me, and Aunt March

for



<P>proving that you do care for me a little bit."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I didn't know how much till she abused you," began Meg.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And I needn't go away, but my stay and be happy, may I, dear?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here was another fine chance to make the crushing speech



<P>and the stately exit, but Meg never thought of doing either,



<P>and disgraced herself forever in Jo's eyes by meekly whispering,



<P>"Yes,&nbsp; John," and hiding her face on Mr. Brooke's waistcoat.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fifteen minutes after Aunt March's departure, Jo came softly



<P>downstairs, paused an instant at the parlor door, and hearing no



<P>sound within, nodded and smiled with a satisfied expression, saying



<P>to herself, "She has seen him away as we planned, and that affair



<P>is settled.&nbsp; I'll go and hear the fun, and have a good laugh over

it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But poor Jo never got her laugh, for she was transfixed upon



<P>the threshold by a spectacle which held her there, staring with



<P>her mouth nearly as wide open as her eyes.&nbsp; Going in to exult over



<P>a fallen enemy and to praise a strong-minded sister for the



<P>banishment of an objectionable lover, it certainly was a shock



<P>to behold the aforesaid enemy serenely sitting on the sofa, with the



<P>strongminded sister enthroned upon his knee and wearing an expression

of



<P>the most abject submission.&nbsp; Jo gave a sort of gasp, as if a cold



<P>shower bath had suddenly fallen upon her, for such an unexpected



<P>turning of the tables actually took her breath away.&nbsp; At the odd



<P>sound the lovers turned and saw her.&nbsp; Meg jumped up, looking both



<P>proud and shy, but `that man', as Jo called him, actually laughed



<P>and said coolly, as he kissed the astonished newcomer, "Sister Jo,



<P>congratulate us!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That was adding insult to injury, it was altogether too much,



<P>and making some wild demonstration with her hands, Jo vanished



<P>without a word.&nbsp; Rushing upstairs, she startled the invalids by



<P>exclaiming tragically as she burst into the room, "Oh, do somebody



<P>go down quick!&nbsp; John Brooke is acting dreadfully, and Meg likes

it!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. and Mrs. March left the room with speed, and casting herself



<P>upon the be, Jo cried and scolded tempestuously as she told the awful



<P>news to Beth and Amy.&nbsp; The little girls, however, considered it

a



<P>most agreeable and interesting event, and Jo got little comfort from



<P>them, so she went up to her refuge in the garret, and confided her



<P>troubles to the rats.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nobody ever knew what went on in the parlor that afternoon, but



<P>a great deal of talking was done, and quiet Mr. Brooke astonished his



<P>friends by the eloquence and spirit with which he pleaded his suit,



<P>told his plans, and persuaded them to arrange everything just as he



<P>wanted it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The tea bell rang before he had finished describing the paradise



<P>which he meant to earn for Meg, and he proudly took her in to supper,



<P>both looking so happy that Jo hadn't the heart to be jealous or dismal.



<P>Amy was very much impressed by John's devotion and Meg's dignity, Beth



<P>beamed at them from a distance, while Mr. and Mrs. March surveyed the



<P>young couple with such tender satisfaction that it was perfectly



<P>evident Aunt March was right in calling them as `unworldly as a pair



<P>of babies'.&nbsp; No one ate much, but everyone looked very happy, and

the



<P>old room seemed to brighten up amazingly when the first romance of



<P>the family began there.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You can't say nothing pleasant ever happens now, can you, Meg?"



<P>said Amy, trying to decide how she would group the lovers in a sketch



<P>she was planning to make.



<P>"No, I'm sure I can't.&nbsp; How much has happened since I said that!



<P>It seems a year ago," answered Meg, who was in a blissful dream



<P>lifted far above such common things as bread and butter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The joys come close upon the sorrows this time, and I rather



<P>think the changes have begun," said Mrs. March.&nbsp; "In most families



<P>there comes, now and then, a year full of events.&nbsp; This has been

such



<P>a one, but it ends well, after all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hope the next will end better," muttered Jo, who found it very



<P>hard to see Meg absorbed in a stranger before her face, for Jo loved



<P>a few persons very dearly and dreaded to have their affection lost



<P>or lessened in any way.



<P>"I hope the third year from this will end better.&nbsp; I mean it



<P>shall, if I live to work out my plans," said Mr. Brooke, smiling at



<P>Meg, as if everything had become possible to him now.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Doesn't it seem very long to wait?" asked Amy, who was in a



<P>hurry for the wedding.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I've got so much to learn before I shall be ready, it seems



<P>a short time to me," answered Meg, with a sweet gravity in her face



<P>never seen there before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You have only to wait, I am to do the work," said John beginning



<P>his labors by picking up Meg's napkin, with an expression which



<P>caused Jo to shake her head, and then say to herself with an air



<P>of relief as the front door banged, "Here comes Laurie.&nbsp; Now we



<P>shall have some sensible conversation."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Jo was mistaken, for Laurie came prancing in, overflowing



<P>with good spirits, bearing a great bridal-looking bouquet for `Mrs.



<P>John Brooke', and evidently laboring under the delusion that the



<P>whole affair had been brought about by his excellent management.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I knew Brooke would have it all his own way, he always does,



<P>for when he makes up his mind to accomplish anything, it's done



<P>though the sky falls," said Laurie, when he had presented his



<P>offering and his congratulations.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Much obliged for that recommendation.&nbsp; I take it as a good



<P>omen for the future and invite you to my wedding on the spot,"



<P>answered Mr. Brooke, who felt at peace with all mankind, even his



<P>mischievous pupil.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll come if I'm at the ens of the earth, for the sight of



<P>Jo's face alone on that occasion would be worth a long journey.



<P>You don't look festive, ma'am, what's the matter?" asked Laurie,



<P>following her into a corner of the parlor, whither all had adjourned



<P>to greet Mr. Laurence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't approve of the match, but I've made up my mind to bear



<P>it, and shall not say a word against it," said Jo solemnly.&nbsp; "You



<P>can't know how hard it is for me to give up Meg," she continued



<P>with a little quiver in her voice.



<P>"You don't give her up.&nbsp; You only go halves," said Laurie



<P>consolingly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It can never be the same again.&nbsp; I've lost my dearest friend,"



<P>sighed Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You've got me, anyhow.&nbsp; I'm not good for much, I know, but



<P>I'll stand by you, Jo, all the days of my life.&nbsp; Upon my word I

will!"



<P>And Laurie meant what he said.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I know you will, and I'm ever so much obliged.&nbsp; You are always



<P>a great comfort to me, Teddy," returned Jo, gratefully shaking hands.



<P>"Well, now, don't be dismal, there's a good fellow.&nbsp; It's all



<P>right you see.&nbsp; Meg is happy, Brooke will fly round and get settled



<P>immediately, Grandpa will attend to him, and it will be very jolly



<P>to see Meg in her own little house.&nbsp; We'll have capital times after



<P>she is gone, for I shall be through college before long, and then



<P>we'll go abroad on some nice trip or other.&nbsp; Wouldn't that console

you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I rather think it would, but there's no knowing what may happen



<P>in three years," said Jo thoughtfully.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's true.&nbsp; Don't you wish you could take a look forward and



<P>wee where we shall all be then?&nbsp; I do," returned Laurie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think not, for I might see something sad, and everyone looks



<P>so happy now, I don't believe they could be much improved." And Jo's



<P>eyes went slowly round the room, brightening as they looked, for the



<P>prospect was a pleasant one.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Father and Mother sat together, quietly reliving the first



<P>chapter of the romance which for them began some twenty years ago.



<P>Amy was drawing the lovers, who sat apart in a beautiful world of



<P>their own, the light of which touched their faces with a grace the



<P>little artist could not copy.&nbsp; Beth lay on her sofa, talking cheerily



<P>with her old friend, who held her little hand as if he felt that it



<P>possessed the power to lead him along the peaceful way she walked.



<P>Jo lounged in her favorite low seat, with the grave quiet look which



<P>best became her, and Laurie, leaning on the back of her chair, his



<P>chin on a level with her curly head, smiled with his friendliest



<P>aspect, and nodded at her in the long glass which reflected them both.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So the curtain falls upon Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy.&nbsp; Whether it



<P>ever rises again, depends upon the reception giveN the first act of



<P>the domestic drama called LITTLE WOMEN.

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Like sunshine after a storm were the peaceful weeks which



<P>followed.&nbsp; The invalids improved rapidly, and Mr. March began



<P>to talk or returning early in the new year.&nbsp; Beth was soon able



<P>to lie on the study sofa all day, amusing herself with the



<P>well-beloved cats at first, and in time with doll's sewing, which had



<P>fallen sadly behindhand.&nbsp; Her once active limbs were so stiff



<P>and feeble that Jo took her for a daily airing about the house



<P>in her strong arms.&nbsp; Meg cheerfully blackened and burned her



<P>white hands cooking delicate messes for `the dear', while Amy,



<P>a loyal slave of the ring, celebrated her return by giving away as



<P>many of her treasures as she could prevail on her sisters to accept.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As Christmas approached, the usual mysteries began to haunt



<P>the house, and Jo frequently convulsed the family by proposing



<P>utterly impossible or magnificently absurd ceremonies, in honor



<P>of this unusually merry Christmas.&nbsp; Laurie was equally impracticable,



<P>and would have had bonfires, skyrockets, and triumphal arches,



<P>if he had had his own way.&nbsp; After many skirmishes and snubbings,



<P>the ambitious pair were considered effectually quenched



<P>and went about with forlorn faces, which were rather belied



<P>by explosions of laughter when the two got together.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Several days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a



<P>splendid Christmas Day.&nbsp; Hannah `felt in her bones' that it was



<P>going to be an unusually fine day, and she proved herself a



<P>true prophetess, for everybody and everything seemed bound to



<P>produce a grand success.&nbsp; To begin with, Mr. March wrote that



<P>he should soon be with them, then Beth felt uncommonly well



<P>that morning, and, being dressed in her mother's gift, a soft



<P>crimson merino wrapper, was borne in high triumph to the window



<P>to behold the offering of Jo and Laurie.&nbsp; The Unquenchables had



<P>done their best to be worthy of the name, for like elves they



<P>had worked by night and conjured up a comical surprise.&nbsp; Out in



<P>the garden stood a stately snow maiden, crowned with holly,



<P>bearing a basket of fruit and flowers in one hand, a great roll



<P>of music in the other, a perfect rainbow of an Afghan round her



<P>chilly shoulders, and a Christmas carol issuing from her lips



<P>on a pink paper streamer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>THE JUNGFRAU TO BETH

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>God bless you, dear Queen Bess!



<P>May nothing you dismay,



<P>But health and peace and happiness



<P>Be yours, this Christmas day.



<P>Here's fruit to feed our busy bee,



<P>And flowers for her nose.



<P>Here's music for her pianee,



<P>An afghan for her toes,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A portrait of Joanna, see,



<P>By Raphael No.&nbsp; 2,



<P>Who laboured with great industry



<P>To make it fair and true.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Accept a ribbon red, I beg,



<P>For Madam Purrer's tail,



<P>And ice cream made by lovely Peg,



<P>A Mont Blanc in a pail.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Their dearest love my makers laid



<P>Within my breast of snow.



<P>Accept it, and the Alpine maid,



<P>From Laurie and from Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>How Beth laughed when she saw it, how Laurie ran up and



<P>down to bring in the gifts, and what ridiculous speeches Jo



<P>made as she presented them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm so full of happiness, that if Father was only here, I



<P>couldn't hold one drop more," said Beth, quite sighing with



<P>contentment as Jo carried her off to the study to rest after the



<P>excitement, and to refresh herself with some of the delicious



<P>grapes the `Jungfrau' had sent her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So am I," added Jo, slapping the pocket wherein reposed



<P>the long-desired UNDINE AND SINTRAM.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm sure I am," echoed Amy, poring over the engraved copy



<P>of the Madonna and Child, which her mother had given her in a



<P>pretty frame.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Of course I am!" cried Meg, smoothing the silvery folds of



<P>her first sild dress, for Mr. Laurence had insisted on giving it.



<P>"How can I be otherwise?" said Mrs. March gratefully, as her



<P>eyes went from her husband's letter to Beth's smiling face, and



<P>her hand carressed the brooch made of gray and golden, chestnut



<P>and dark brown hair, which the girls had just fastened on her



<P>breast.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now and then, in this workaday world, things do happen in



<P>the delightful storybook fashion, and what a comfort it is.&nbsp; Half



<P>an hour after everyone had said they were so happy they could



<P>only hold one drop more, the drop came.&nbsp; Laurie opened the parlor



<P>door and popped his head in very quietly.&nbsp; He might just as well



<P>have turned a somersault and uttered an Indian war whoop, for his



<P>face was so full of suppressed excitement and his voice so



<P>treacherously joyful that everyone jumped up, though he only said,



<P>in a queer, breathless voice, "Here's another Christmas present



<P>for the March family."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Before the words were well out of his mouth, he was whisked



<P>away somehow, and in his place appeared a tall man, muffled up to



<P>the eyes, leaning on the arm of another tall man, who tried to say



<P>something and couldn't.&nbsp; Of course there was a general stampede,



<P>and for several minutes everybody seemed to lose their wits, for



<P>the strangest things were done, and no one said a word.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. March became invisible in the embrace of four pairs of



<P>loving arms.&nbsp; Jo disgraced herself by nearly fainting away, and



<P>had to be doctored by Laurie in the china closet.&nbsp; Mr. Brooke



<P>kissed Meg entirely by mistake, as he somewhat incoherently



<P>explained.&nbsp; And Amy, the dignified, tumbled over a stool, and never



<P>stopping to get up, hugged and cried over her father's boots in



<P>the most touching manner.&nbsp; Mrs. March was the first to recover



<P>herself, and held up her hand with a warning, "Hush!&nbsp; Remember

Beth."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But it was too late.&nbsp; The study door flew open, the little



<P>red wrapper appeared on the threshold, joy put strength into the



<P>feeble limbs, and Beth ran straight into her father's arms.&nbsp; Never



<P>mind what happened just after that, for the full hearts overflowed,



<P>washing away the bitterness of the past and leaving only the



<P>sweetness of the present.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was not at all romantic, but a hearty laugh set everybody



<P>straight again, for Hannah was discovered behind the door, sobbing



<P>over the fat turkey, which she had forgotten to put down when she



<P>rushed up from the kitchen.&nbsp; As the laugh subsided, Mrs. March

began



<P>to thank Mr. Brooke for his faithful care of her husband, at which



<P>Mr. Brooke suddenly remembered that Mr. March needed rest, and



<P>seizing Laurie, he precipitately retired.&nbsp; Then the two invalids



<P>were ordered to repose, which they did, by both sitting in one



<P>big chair and talking hard.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. March told how he had longed to surprise them, and how,



<P>when the fine weather came, he had been allowed by his doctor, to



<P>take advantage of it, how devoted Brooke had been, and how he was



<P>altogether a most estimable and upright young man.&nbsp; Why Mr. March



<P>paused a minute just there, and after a glance at Meg, who was



<P>violently poking the fire, looked at his wife with an inquiring



<P>lift of the eyebrows, I leave you to imagine.&nbsp; Also why Mrs.



<P>March gently nodded her head and asked, rather abruptly, if he



<P>wouldn't like to have something to eat.&nbsp; Jo saw and understood



<P>the look, and she stalked grimly away to get wine and beef tea,



<P>muttering to herself as she slammed the door, "I hate estimable



<P>young men with brown eyes!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There never was such a Christmas dinner as they had that day.



<P>The fat turkey was a sight to behold, when Hannah sent him up,



<P>stuffed, browned, and decorated.&nbsp; So was the plum pudding, which



<P>melted in one's mouth, likewise the jellies, in which Amy reveled



<P>like a fly in a honeypot.&nbsp; Everything turned out well, which was



<P>a mercy, Hannah said, "For my mind was that flustered, Mum, that



<P>it's a merrycle I didn't roast the pudding, and stuff the turkey



<P>with raisins, let alone bilin' of it in a cloth."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Laurence and his grandson dined with them, also Mr.



<P>Brooke, at whom Jo glowered darkly, to Laurie's infinite amusement.



<P>Two easy chairs stood side by side at the head of the table, in



<P>which sat Beth and her father, feasting modestly on chicken and a



<P>little fruit.&nbsp; They drank healths, told stories, sang songs,



<P>`reminisced', as the old folks say, and had a thoroughly good time.



<P>A sleigh ride had been planned, but the girls would not leave their



<P>father, so the guests departed early, and as twilight gathered, the



<P>happy family sat together round the fire.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Just a year ago we were groaning over the dismal Christmas we



<P>expected to have.&nbsp; Do you remember?" asked Jo, breaking a short



<P>pause which had followed a long conversation about many things.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Rather a pleasant year on the whole!" said Meg, smiling at



<P>the fire, and congratulating herself on having treated Mr. Brooke



<P>with dignity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think it's been a pretty hard one," observed Amy, watching



<P>the light shine on her ring with thoughtful eyes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"i'm glad it's over, because we've got you back," whispered



<P>Beth, who sat on her father's knee.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Rather a rough road for you to travel, my little pilgrims,



<P>especially the latter part of it.&nbsp; But you have got on bravely,



<P>and I think the burdens are in a fair way to tumble off very soon,"



<P>said Mr. March, looking with fatherly satisfaction at the four



<P>young faces gathered round him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How do you know?&nbsp; Did Mother tell you?' asked Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not much.&nbsp; Straws show which way the wind blows, and I've



<P>made several discoveries today."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, tell us what they are!" cried Meg, who sat beside him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here is one." And taking up the hand which lay on the arm



<P>of his chair, he pointed to the roughened forefinger, a burn on



<P>the back, and two or three little hard spots on the palm.&nbsp; "I



<P>remember a time when this hand was white and smooth, and your



<P>first care was to keep it so.&nbsp; It was very pretty then, but to



<P>me it is much prettier now, for in this seeming blemishes I read



<P>a little history.&nbsp; A burnt offering has been made to vanity, this



<P>hardened palm has earned something better than blisters, and I'm



<P>sure the sewing done by these pricked fingers will last a long



<P>time, so much good will went into the stitches.&nbsp; Meg, my dear,



<P>I value the womanly skill which keeps home happy more than white



<P>hands or fashionable accomplishments.&nbsp; I'm proud to shake this



<P>good, industrious little hand, and hope I shall not soon be



<P>asked to give it away."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If Meg had wanted a reward for hours of patient labor, she



<P>received it in the hearty pressure of her father's hand and the



<P>approving smile he gave her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What about Jo?&nbsp; Please say something nice, for she has tried



<P>so hard and been so very, very good to me," said Beth in her father's



<P>ear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He laughed and looked across at the tall girl who sat opposite,



<P>with and unusually mild expression in her face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"In spite of the curly crop, I don't see the `son Jo' whom I



<P>left a year ago," said Mr. March.&nbsp; "I see a young lady who pins



<P>her collar straight, laces her boots neatly, and neither whistles,



<P>talks slang, nor lies on the rug as she used to do.&nbsp; Her face is



<P>rather thin and pale just now, with watching and anxiety, but I



<P>like to look at it, for it has grown gentler, and her voice is



<P>lower.&nbsp; She doesn't bounce, but moves quietly, and takes care of



<P>a certain little person in a motherly way which delights me.&nbsp; I



<P>rather miss my wild girl, but if I get a strong, helpful,



<P>tenderhearted woman in her place, I shall feel quite satisfied.



<P>I don't know whether the shearing sobered our black sheep, but I do



<P>know that in all Washington I couldn't find anything beautiful enough



<P>to be bought with the five-and-twenty dollars my good girl sent me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo's keen eyes were rather dim for a minute, and her thin



<P>face grew rosy in the firelight as she received her father's praise,



<P>feeling that she did deserve a portion of it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now, Beth," said Amy, longing for her turn, but ready to wait.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There's so little of her, I'm afraid to say much, for fear



<P>she will slip away altogether, though she is not so shy as she used



<P>to be," began their father cheerfully.&nbsp; But recollecting how nearly



<P>he had lost her, he held her close, saying tenderly, with her cheek



<P>against his own, "I've got you safe, my Beth, and I'll keep you so,



<P>please God."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a minute's silence, he looked down at Amy, who sat on



<P>the cricket at his feet, and said, with a caress of the shining



<P>hair...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I observed that Amy took drumsticks at dinner, ran errands



<P>for her mother all the afternoon, gave Meg her place tonight, and



<P>has waited on every on with patience and good humor.&nbsp; I also



<P>observe that she does not fret much nor look in the glass, and has



<P>not even mentioned a very pretty ring which she wears, so I



<P>conclude that she has learned to think of other people more and of



<P>herself less, and has decided to try and mold her character as



<P>carefully as she molds her little clay figures.&nbsp; I am glad of



<P>this, for though I should be very proud of a graceful statue made



<P>by her, I shall be infinitely prouder of a lovable daughter with



<P>a talent for making life beautiful to herself and others."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What are you thinking of, Beth?" asked Jo, when Amy had



<P>thanked her father and told about her ring.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I read in PILGRIM'S PROGRESS today how, after many troubles,



<P>christian and Hopeful came to a pleasant green meadow where lilies



<P>bloomed all year round, and there they rested happily, as we do



<P>now, before they went on to their journey's end," answered Beth,



<P>adding, as she slipped out of her father's arms and went to the



<P>instrument, "It's singing time now, and I want to be in my old



<P>place.&nbsp; I'll try to sing the song of the shepherd boy which the



<P>Pilgrims heard.&nbsp; I made the music for Father, because he likes



<P>the verses."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So, sitting at the dear little piano, Beth softly touched the



<P>keys, and in the sweet voice they had never thought to hear again,



<P>sang to her own accompaniment the quaint hymn, which was a



<P>singularly fitting song for her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He that is down need fear no fall,



<P>He that is low no pride.



<P>He that is humble ever shall



<P>Have God to be his guide.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I am content with what I have,



<P>Little be it, or much.



<P>And, Lord!&nbsp; Contentment still I crave,



<P>Because Thou savest such.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fulness to them a burden is,



<P>That go on pilgrimage.



<P>Here little, and hereafter bliss,



<P>Is best from age to age!

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Jo came home that spring, she had been struck with



<P>the change in Beth.&nbsp; No one spoke of it or seemed aware of it,



<P>for it had come too gradually to startle those who saw her



<P>daily, but to eyes sharpened by absence, it was very plain and



<P>a heavy weight fell on Jo's heart as she saw her sister's face.



<P>It was no paler and but littler thinner than in the autumn, yet



<P>there was a strange, transparent look about it, as if the mortal



<P>was being slowly refined away, and the immortal shining through



<P>the frail flesh with an indescribably pathetic beauty.&nbsp; Jo saw



<P>and felt it, but said nothing at the time, and soon the first



<P>impression lost much of its power, for Beth seemed happy, no



<P>one appeared to doubt that she was better, and presently in



<P>other cares Jo fora time forgot her fear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But when Laurie was gone, and peace prevailed again, the



<P>vague anxiety returned and haunted her.&nbsp; She had confessed



<P>her sins and been forgiven, but when she showed her savings



<P>and proposed a mountain trip, Beth had thanked her heartily,



<P>but begged not to go so far away from home.&nbsp; Another little



<P>visit to the seashore would suit her better, and as Grandma



<P>could not be prevailed upon to leave the babies, Jo took Beth



<P>down to the quiet place, where she could live much in the



<P>open air, and let the fresh sea breezes blow a little color



<P>into her pale cheeks.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was not a fashionable place, but even among the pleasant



<P>people there, the girls made few friends, preferring to live for



<P>one another.&nbsp; Beth was too shy to enjoy society, and Jo too



<P>wrapped up in her to care for anyone else.&nbsp; So they were all in



<P>all to each other, and came and went, quite unconscious of the



<P>interest they exited in those about them, who watched with sympathetic



<P>eyes the strong sister and the feeble one, always



<P>together, as if they felt instinctively that a long separation



<P>was not far away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They did feel it, yet neither spoke of it, for often between



<P>ourselves and those nearest and dearest to us there exists a reserve



<P>which it is very hard to overcome.&nbsp; Jo felt as if a veil



<P>had fallen between her heart and Beth's, but when she put out



<P>her hand to lift it up, there seemed something sacred in the



<P>silence, and she waited for Beth to speak.&nbsp; She wondered, and



<P>was thankful also, that her parents did not seem to see what



<P>she saw, and during the quiet weeks when the shadows grew so



<P>plain to her, she said nothing of it to those at home, believing



<P>that it would tell itself when Beth came back no better.



<P>She wondered still more if her sister really guessed the hard



<P>truth, and what thoughts were passing through her mind during



<P>the long hours when she lay on the warm rocks with her head in



<P>Jo's lap, while the winds blew healthfully over her and the sea



<P>made music at her feet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One day Beth told her.&nbsp; Jo thought she was asleep, she lay



<P>so still, and putting down her book, sat looking at her with



<P>wistful eyes, trying to see signs of hope in the faint color on



<P>Beth's cheeks.&nbsp; But she could not find enough to satisfy her,



<P>for the cheeks were very thin, and the hands seemed too feeble



<P>to hold even the rosy little shells they had been collecting.



<P>It came to her then more bitterly than ever that Beth was



<P>slowly drifting away form her, and her arms instinctively



<P>tightened their hold upon the dearest treasure she possessed.



<P>For a minute her eyes were too dim for seeing, and when they



<P>cleared, Beth was looking up at her so tenderly that there was



<P>hardly any need for her to say, "Jo, dear, I'm glad you know



<P>it.&nbsp; I've tried to tell you, but I couldn't."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was no answer except her sister's cheek against her



<P>own, not even tears, for when most deeply moved, Jo did not



<P>cry.&nbsp; She was the weaker then, land Beth tried to comfort and



<P>sustain her, with her arms about her and the soothing words



<P>she whispered in her ear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I've known it for a good while, dear, and now I'm used



<P>to it, it isn't hard to think of or to bear.&nbsp; Try to see it so



<P>and don't be troubled about me, because it's best, indeed it is."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Is this what made you so unhappy in the autumn, Beth? You



<P>did not feel it then, land keep it to yourself so long, did you?"



<P>asked Jo, refusing to see or say that it was best, but glad to



<P>know that Laurie had no part in Beth's trouble.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, I gave up hoping then, but I didn't like to own it.



<P>I tried to think it was a sick fancy, and would not let it



<P>trouble anyone.&nbsp; But when I saw you all so well and strong and



<P>full of happy plans, it was hard to feel that I could never be



<P>like you, and then I was miserable, Jo."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, Beth, and you didn't tell me, didn't let me comfort and



<P>help you?&nbsp; How could you shut me out, bear it all alone?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo's voice was full of tender reproach, and her heart ached



<P>to think of the solitary struggle that must have gone on while



<P>Beth learned to say goodbye to health, love, and live, and take



<P>up her cross so cheerfully.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Perhaps it was wrong, but I tried to do right.&nbsp; I wasn't sure,



<P>no one said anything, and I hoped I was mistaken.&nbsp; It would have



<P>been selfish to frighten you all when Marmee was so anxious about



<P>Meg, and Amy away, and you so happy with Laurie--at least I thought



<P>so then."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And I thought you loved him, Beth, and I went away because



<P>I couldn't," cried Jo, glad to say all the truth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Beth looked so amazed at the idea that Jo smiled in spite



<P>of her pain, and added softly, "Then you didn't, dearie? I was



<P>afraid it was so, and imagined your poor little heart full of



<P>lovelornity all that while."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, Jo, how could I, when he was so fond of you?" asked



<P>Beth, as innocently as a child.&nbsp; "I do love him dearly.&nbsp; He

is



<P>so good to me, how can I help It?&nbsp; But he could never be anything



<P>to me but my brother.&nbsp; I hope he truly will be, sometime."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not through me," said Jo decidedly.&nbsp; "Amy is left for him,



<P>and they would suit excellently, but I have no heart for such



<P>things, now.&nbsp; I don't care what becomes of anybody but you, Beth.



<P>You must get well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I want to, oh, so much!&nbsp; I try, but every day I lose a little,



<P>and feel more sure that I shall never gain it back.&nbsp; It's like

the



<P>tide, Jo, when it turns, it goes slowly, but it can't be stopped.."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It shall be stopped, your tide must not turn so soon, nineteen



<P>is too young, Beth.&nbsp; I can't let you go.&nbsp; I'll work and pray



<P>and fight against it.&nbsp; I'll keep you in spite of everything.&nbsp;

There



<P>must be ways, it can't be too late.&nbsp; God won't be so cruel as to



<P>take you from me," cried poor Jo rebelliously, for her spirit was



<P>far less piously submissive than Beth's.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Simple, sincere people seldom speak much of their piety.&nbsp; It



<P>shows itself in acts rather than in words, and has more influence



<P>than homilies or protestations.&nbsp; Beth could not reason upon or



<P>explain the faith that gave her courage and patience to give up



<P>life, and cheerfully wait for death.&nbsp; Like a confiding child, she



<P>asked no questions, but left everything to God and nature, Father



<P>and Mother of us all, feeling sure that they, and they only,



<P>could teach and strengthen heart and spirit for this life and



<P>the life to come.&nbsp; She did not rebuke Jo with saintly speeches,



<P>only loved her better for her passionate affection, and clung



<P>more closely to the dear human love, from which our Father never



<P>means us to be weaned, but through which He draws us closer to



<P>Himself.&nbsp; She could not say, "I'm glad to go," for life was very



<P>sweet for her.&nbsp; She could only sob out, "I try to be willing,"



<P>while she held fast to Jo, as the first bitter wave of this



<P>great sorrow broke over them together.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>By and by Beth said, with recovered serenity, "You'll tell



<P>them this when we go home?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think they will see it without words," sighed Jo, for now



<P>it seemed to her that Beth changed every day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Perhaps not.&nbsp; I've heard that the people who love best are



<P>often blindest to such things.&nbsp; If they don't see it, you will

tell



<P>them for me.&nbsp; I don't want any secrets, and it's kinder to prepare



<P>them.&nbsp; Meg has John and the babies to comfort her, but you must



<P>stand by Father and Mother, won't you Jo?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If I can.&nbsp; But, Beth, I don't give up yet.&nbsp; I'm going to

believe



<P>that it is a sick fancy, and not let you think it's true."



<P>said Jo, trying to speak cheerfully.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Beth lay a minute thinking, and then said in her quiet way,



<P>"I don't know how to express myself, and shouldn't try to anyone



<P>but you, because I can't speak out except to my Jo.&nbsp; I only mean



<P>to say that I have a feeling that it never was intended I should



<P>live long.&nbsp; I'm not like the rest of you.&nbsp; I never made any

plans



<P>about what I'd do when I grew up.&nbsp; I never thought of being married,



<P>as you all did.&nbsp; I couldn't seem to imagine myself anything



<P>but stupid little Beth, trotting about at home, of no use anywhere



<P>but there.&nbsp; I never wanted to go away, and the hard part now is



<P>the leaving you all.&nbsp; I'm not afraid, but it seems as if I should



<P>be homesick for you even in heaven."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo could not speak, and for several minutes there was no



<P>sound but the sigh of the wind and the lapping of the tide.&nbsp; A



<P>white-winged gull flew by, with the flash of sunshine on its



<P>silvery breast.&nbsp; Beth watched it till it vanished, and her eyes



<P>were full of sadness.&nbsp; A little gray-coated sand bird came tripping



<P>over the beach `peeping' softly to itself, as if enjoying



<P>the sun and sea.&nbsp; It came quite close to Beth, and looked at her



<P>with a friendly eye and sat upon a warm stone, dressing its wet



<P>feathers, quite at home.&nbsp; Beth smiled and felt comforted, for



<P>the tiny thing seemed to offer its small friendship and remind



<P>her that a pleasant world was still to be enjoyed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dear little bird!&nbsp; See, Jo, how tame it is.&nbsp; I like peeps



<P>better than the gulls.&nbsp; They are not so wild and handsome, but



<P>they seem happy, confiding little things.&nbsp; I used to call them



<P>my birds last summer, and Mother said they reminded her of me



<P>--busy, quaker-colored creatures, always near the shore, and



<P>always chirping that contented little song of theirs.&nbsp; You are



<P>the gull, Jo, strong and wild, fond of the storm and the wind,



<P>flying far out to sea, and happy all alone.&nbsp; Meg is the turtledove,



<P>and Amy is like the lark she write about, trying to get



<P>up among the clouds, but always dropping down into its nest



<P>again.&nbsp; Dear little girl!&nbsp; She's so ambitious, but her heart

is



<P>good and tender, and no matter how high she flies, she never



<P>will forget home.&nbsp; I hope I shall see her again, but she seems



<P>so far away."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She is coming in the spring, and I mean that you shall be



<P>all ready to see and enjoy her.&nbsp; I'm going to have you well and



<P>rosy by that time." began Jo, feeling that of all the changes



<P>in Beth, the talking change was the greatest, for it seemed to



<P>cost no effort now, and she thought aloud in a way quite unlike



<P>bashful Beth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Jo, dear, don't hope any more.&nbsp; It won't do any good.&nbsp; I'm



<P>sure of that.&nbsp; We won't be miserable, but enjoy being together



<P>while we wait.&nbsp; We'll have happy times, for I don't suffer much,



<P>and I think the tide will go out easily, if you help me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo leaned down to kiss the tranquil face, and with that



<P>silent kiss, she dedicated herself soul and body to Beth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was right.&nbsp; There was no need of any words when they



<P>got home, for Father and Mother saw plainly now what they had



<P>prayed to be saved from seeing.&nbsp; Tired with her short journey,



<P>Beth went at once to bed, saying how glad she was to be home,



<P>and when Jo went down, she found that she would be spared the



<P>hard task of telling Beth's secret.&nbsp; Her father stood leaning



<P>his head on the mantelpiece and did not turn as she came in,



<P>but her mother stretched out her arms as if for help, and Jo



<P>went to comfort her without a word.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I don't think I have any words in which to tell the meeting



<P>of the mother and daughters.&nbsp; Such hours are beautiful to live,



<P>but very hard to describe, so I will leave it to the imagination



<P>of my readers, merely saying that the house was full of genuine



<P>happiness, and that Meg's tender hope was realized, for when Beth



<P>woke from that long, healing sleep, the first objects on which



<P>her eyes fell were the little rose and Mother's face.&nbsp; Too weak



<P>to wonder at anything, she only smiled and nestled close in the



<P>loving arms about her, feeling that the hungry longing was



<P>satisfied at last.&nbsp; Then she slept again, and the girls waited

upon



<P>their mother, for she would not unclasp the thin hand which



<P>clung to hers even in sleep.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Hannah had `dished up' and astonishing breakfast for the



<P>traveler, finding it impossible to vent her excitement in any



<P>other way, and Meg and Jo fed their mother like dutiful young



<P>storks, while they listened to her whispered account of Father's



<P>state, Mr. Brooke's promise to stay and nurse him, the delays



<P>which the storm occasioned on the homeward journey, and the



<P>unspeakable comfort Laurie's hopeful face had given her when she



<P>arrived, worn out with fatigue, anxiety, and cold.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>What a strange yet pleasant day that was.&nbsp; So brilliant and



<P>gay without, for all the world seemed abroad to welcome the first



<P>snow.&nbsp; So quiet and reposeful within, for everyone slept, spent



<P>with watching, and a Sabbath stillness reigned through the house,



<P>while nodding Hannah mounted guard at the door.&nbsp; With a blissful



<P>sense of burdens lifted off, Meg and Jo closed their weary eyes,



<P>and lay at rest, like storm-beaten boats safe at anchor in a



<P>quiet harbor.&nbsp; Mrs. March would not leave Beth's side, but rested



<P>in the big chair, waking often to look at, touch, and brood over



<P>her child, like a miser over some recovered treasure.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie meanwhile posted off to comfort Amy, and told his



<P>story so well that Aunt March actually `sniffed' herself, and



<P>never once said "I told you so".&nbsp; Amy came out so strong on



<P>this occasion that I think the good thoughts in the little chapel



<P>really began to bear fruit.&nbsp; She dried her tears quickly,



<P>restrained her impatience to see her mother, and never even thought



<P>of the turquoise ring, when the old lady heartily agreed in Laurie's



<P>opinion, that she behaved `like a capital little woman'.&nbsp; Even



<P>Polly seemed impressed, for he called her a good girl, blessed



<P>her buttons, and begged her to "come and take a walk, dear", in



<P>his most affable tone.&nbsp; She would very gladly have gone out to



<P>enjoy the bright wintry weather, but discovering that Laurie



<P>was dropping with sleep in spite of manful efforts to conceal



<P>the fact, she persuaded him to rest on the sofa, while she wrote



<P>a note to her mother.&nbsp; She was a long time about it, and when she



<P>returned, he was stretched out with both arms under his head,



<P>sound asleep, while Aunt March had pulled down the curtains and



<P>sat doing nothing in an unusual fit of benignity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a while, they began to think he was not going to wake



<P>up till night, and I'm not sure that he would, had he not been



<P>effectually roused by Amy's cry of joy at sight of her mother.



<P>There probably were a good many happy little girls in and about



<P>the city that day, but it is my private opinion that Amy was the



<P>happiest of all, when she sat in her mother's lap and told her



<P>trials, receiving consolation and compensation in the shape of



<P>approving smiles and fond caresses.&nbsp; They were alone together



<P>in the chapel, to which her mother did not object when its



<P>purpose was explained to her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"On the contrary, I like it very much, dear," looking from



<P>the dusty rosary to the well-worn little book, and the lovely



<P>picture with its garland of evergreen.&nbsp; "It is an excellent plan



<P>to have some place where we can go to be quiet, when things vex



<P>or grieve us.&nbsp; There are a good many hard times in this life of



<P>ours, but we can always bear them if we ask help in the right



<P>way.&nbsp; I think my little girl is learning this."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, Mother, and when I go home I mean to have a corner



<P>in the big closet to put my books and the copy of that picture



<P>which I've tried to make.&nbsp; The woman's face is not good, it's



<P>too beautiful for me to draw, but the baby is done better, and



<P>I love it very much.&nbsp; I like to think He was a little child once,



<P>for then I don't seem so far away, and that helps me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As Amy pointed to the smiling Christ child on his Mother's



<P>knee, Mrs. March saw something on the lifted hand that made her



<P>smile.&nbsp; She said nothing, but Amy understood the look, and after



<P>a minute's pause, she added gravely, "I wanted to speak to you



<P>about this, but I forgot it.&nbsp; Aunt gave me the ring today.&nbsp;

She



<P>called me to her and kissed me, and put it on my finger, and



<P>said I was a credit to her, and she'd like to keep me always.



<P>She gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on, as it's too



<P>big.&nbsp; I'd like to wear them Mother, can I?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They are very pretty, but I think you're rather too young



<P>for such ornaments, Amy," said Mrs. March, looking at the plump



<P>little hand, with the band of sky-blue stones on the forefinger,



<P>and the quaint guard formed of two tiny golden hands clasped



<P>together.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll try not to be vain," said Amy.&nbsp; "I don't think I like



<P>it only because it's so pretty, but I want to wear it as the girl



<P>in the story wore her bracelet, to remind me of something."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you mean Aunt March?" asked her mother, laughing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, to remind me not to be selfish."&nbsp; Amy looked so



<P>earnest and sincere about it that her mother stopped laughing,



<P>and listened respectfully to the little plan.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I've thought a great deal lately about my `bundle of



<P>naughties', and being selfish is the largest one in it, so I'm



<P>going to try hard to cure it, if I can.&nbsp; Beth isn't selfish, and



<P>that's the reason everyone loves her and feels so bad at the



<P>thoughts of losing her.&nbsp; People wouldn't feel so bat about me



<P>if I was sick, and I don't deserve to have them, but I'd like



<P>to be loved and missed by a great many friends, so I'm going



<P>to try and be like Beth all I can.&nbsp; I'm apt to forget my



<P>resolutions, but if I had something always about me to remind me,



<P>I guess I should do better.&nbsp; May we try this way?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, but I have more faith in the corner of the big closet.



<P>Wear your ring, dear, and do your best.&nbsp; I think you will prosper,



<P>for the sincere wish to be good is half the battle.&nbsp; Now I must



<P>go back to Beth.&nbsp; Keep up your heart, little daughter, and we will



<P>soon have you home again."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That evening while Meg was writing to her father to report



<P>the traveler's safe arrival, Jo slipped upstairs into Beth's room,



<P>and finding her mother in her usual place, stood a minute twisting



<P>her fingers in her hair, with a worried gesture and an undecided



<P>look.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What is it, deary?' asked Mrs. March, holding out her hand,



<P>with a face which invited confidence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I want to tell you something, Mother."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"About Meg?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How quickly you guessed!&nbsp; Yes, it's about her, and though



<P>it's a little thing, it fidgets me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Beth is asleep.&nbsp; Speak low, and tell me all about it.&nbsp; That



<P>Moffat hasn't been here, I hope?" asked Mrs. March rather sharply.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No.&nbsp; I should have shut the door in his face if he had,"



<P>said Jo, settling herself on the floor at her mother's feet.&nbsp; "Last



<P>summer Meg left a pair of gloves over at the Laurences' and only



<P>one was returned.&nbsp; We forgot about it, till Teddy told me that

Mr.



<P>Brooke owned that he liked Meg but didn't dare say so, she was so



<P>young and he so poor.&nbsp; Now, isn't it a dreadful state of things?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you think Meg cares for him?" asked Mrs. March, with an



<P>anxious look.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mercy me!&nbsp; I don't know anything about love and such



<P>nonsense!" cried Jo, with a funny mixture of interest and contempt.



<P>"In novels, the girls show it by starting and blushing, fainting



<P>away, growing thin, and acting like fools.&nbsp; Now Meg does not do



<P>anything of the sort.&nbsp; She eats and drinks and sleeps like a



<P>sensible creature, she looks straight in my face when I talk



<P>about that man, and only blushes a little bit when Teddy jokes



<P>about lovers.&nbsp; I forbid him to do it, but he doesn't mind me as



<P>he ought."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then you fancy that Meg is not interested in John?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Who?" cried Jo, staring.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr. Brooke.&nbsp; I call him `John' now.&nbsp; We fell into the way



<P>of doing so at the hospital, and he likes it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, dear!&nbsp; I know you'll take his part.&nbsp; He's been good to



<P>Father, and you won't send him away, but let Meg marry him, if



<P>she wants to.&nbsp; Mean thing!&nbsp; To go petting Papa and helping

you,



<P>just to wheedle you into liking him." And Jo pulled her hair



<P>again with a wrathful tweak.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear, don't get angry about it, and I will tell you how



<P>it happened.&nbsp; John went with me at Mr. Laurence's request, and



<P>was so devoted to poor Father that we couldn't help getting fond



<P>of him.&nbsp; He was perfectly open and honorable about Meg, for he



<P>told us he loved her, but would earn a comfortable home before



<P>he asked her to marry him.&nbsp; He only wanted our leave to love her



<P>and work for her, and the right to make her love him if he could.



<P>He is a truly excellent young man, and we could not refuse to



<P>listen to him, but I will not consent to Meg's engaging herself



<P>so young."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Of course not.&nbsp; It would be idiotic!&nbsp; I knew there was



<P>mischief brewing.&nbsp; I felt it, and now it's worse than I imagined.



<P>I just wish I could marry Meg myself, and keep her safe in the



<P>family."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This odd arrangement made Mrs. March smile, but she said



<P>gravely, "Jo, I confide in you and don't wish you to say anything



<P>to Meg yet.&nbsp; When John comes back, and I see them together, I can



<P>judge better of her feelings toward him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She'll see those handsome eyes that she talks about, and



<P>then it will be all up with her.&nbsp; She's got such a soft heart,



<P>it will melt like butter in the sun if anyone looks sentimentlly



<P>at her.&nbsp; She read the short reports he sent more than she did



<P>your letters, and pinched me when I spoke of it, and likes brown



<P>eyes, and doesn't think John an ugly name, and she'll go and fall



<P>in love, and there's an end of peace and fun, and cozy times together.



<P>I see it all!&nbsp; They'll go lovering around the house, and we shall



<P>have to dodge.&nbsp; Meg will be absorbed and no good to me any more.



<P>Brooke will scratch up a fortune somehow, carry her off,



<P>and make a hole in the family, and I shall break my heart, and



<P>everything will be abominably uncomfortable.&nbsp; Oh, dear me!&nbsp;

Why



<P>weren't we all boys, then there wouldn't be any bother."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo leaned her chin on her knees in a disconsolate attitude



<P>and shook her fist at the reprehensible John.&nbsp; Mrs. March sighed,



<P>and Jo looked up with an air of relief.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You don't like it, Mother?&nbsp; I'm glad of it.&nbsp; Let's send him



<P>about his business, and not tell Meg a word of it, but all be



<P>happy together as we always have been."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I did wrong to sigh, Jo.&nbsp; It is natural and right you should



<P>all go to homes of your own in time, but I do want to keep my girls



<P>as long as I can, and I am sorry that this happened so soon, for



<P>Meg is only seventeen and it will be some years before John can



<P>make a home for her.&nbsp; Your father and I have agreed that she shall



<P>not bind herself in any way, nor be married, before twenty.&nbsp; If



<P>she and John love one another, they can wait, and test the love



<P>by doing so.&nbsp; She is conscientious, and I have no fear of her



<P>treating him unkindly.&nbsp; My pretty, tender hearted girl!&nbsp; I

hope



<P>things will go happily with her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hadn't you rather have her marry a rich man?" asked Jo, as



<P>her mother's voice faltered a little over the last words.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Money is a good and useful thing, Jo, and I hope my girls



<P>will never feel the need of it too bitterly not be tempted by



<P>too much.&nbsp; I should like to know that John was firmly established



<P>in some good business, which gave him an income large enough to



<P>keep free from debt and make Meg comfortable.&nbsp; I'm not ambitious



<P>for a splendid fortune, a fashionable position, or a great name



<P>for my girls.&nbsp; If rank and money come with love and virtue, also,



<P>I should accept them gratefully, and enjoy your good fortune, but



<P>I know, by experience, how much genuine happiness can be had in



<P>a plain little house, where the daily bread is earned, and some



<P>privations give sweetness to the few pleasures.&nbsp; I am content to



<P>see Meg begin humbly, for if I am not mistaken, she will be rich



<P>in the possession of a good man's heart, and that is better than



<P>a fortune."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I understand, Mother, and quite agree, but I'm disappointed



<P>about Meg, for I'd planned to have her marry Teddy by-and-by and



<P>sit in the lap of luxury all her days.&nbsp; Wouldn't it be nice?"



<P>asked Jo, looking up with a brighter face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He is younger than she, you know," began Mrs. March, but Jo



<P>broke in...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Only a little, he's old for his age, and tall, and can be



<P>quite grown-up in his manners if he likes.&nbsp; Then he's rich and



<P>generous and good, and loves us all, and I say it's a pity my



<P>plan is spoiled."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm afraid Laurie is hardly grown-up enough for Meg, and



<P>altogether too much of a weathercock just now for anyone to



<P>depend on.&nbsp; Don't make plans, Jo, but let time and their own



<P>hearts mate your friends.&nbsp; We can't meddle safely in such



<P>matters, and had better not get `romantic rubbish' as you



<P>call it, into our heads, lest it spoil our friendship."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I won't, but I hate to see things going all crisscross



<P>and getting snarled up, when a pull her and a snip there



<P>would straighten it out.&nbsp; I wish wearing flatirons on our heads



<P>would keep us from growing up.&nbsp; But buds will be roses, and



<P>kittens cats, more's the pity!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What's that about flatirons and cats?" asked Meg, as she



<P>crept into the room with the finished letter in her hand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Only one of my stupid speeches.&nbsp; I'm going to bed.&nbsp; Come,



<P>Peggy," said Jo, unfolding herself like an animated puzzle.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Quite right, and beautifully written.&nbsp; Please add that I



<P>send my love to John," said Mrs. March, as she glanced over



<P>the letter and gave it back.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you call him `John'?" asked Meg, smiling, with her



<P>innocent eyes looking down into her mother's.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, he has been like a son to us, and we are very fond of him,"



<P>replied Mrs. March, returning the look with a keen one.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm glad of that, he is so lonely.&nbsp; Good night, Mother,



<P>dear.&nbsp; It is so inexpressibly comfortable to have you here,"



<P>was Meg's answer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The kiss her mother gave her was a very tender one, and



<P>as she went away, Mrs. March said, with a mixture of satisfaction



<P>and regret, "She does not love John yet, but will soon learn to.

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Though very happy in the social atmosphere about her, and



<P>very busy with the daily work that earned her bread and made it



<P>sweeter for the effort, Jo still found time for literary labors.



<P>The purpose which now took possession of her was a natural one



<P>to a poor and ambitious girl, but the means she took to gain



<P>her end were not the best.&nbsp; She saw that money conferred power,



<P>therefore, she resolved to have, not to be used for herself alone,



<P>but for those whom she loved more than life.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The dream of filling home with comforts, giving Beth everything



<P>she wanted, from strawberries in winter to an organ in her bedroom,



<P>going abroad herself, and always having more than enough,



<P>so that she might indulge in the luxury of charity, had been



<P>for years Jo's most cherished castle in the air.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The prize-story experience had seemed to open a way which



<P>might, after long traveling and much uphill work, lead to this



<P>delightful chateau en Espagne.&nbsp; But the novel disaster quenched



<P>her courage for a time, for public opinion is a giant which has



<P>frightened stouter-hearted Jacks on bigger beanstalks than hers.



<P>Like that immortal hero, she reposed awhile after the first



<P>attempt, which resulted in a tumble and the least lovely of the



<P>giant's treasures, if I remember rightly.&nbsp; But the `up again



<P>and take another' spirit was as strong in Jo as in Jack, so



<P>she scrambled up on the shady side this time and got more



<P>booty, but nearly left behind her what was far more precious



<P>than the moneybags.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She took to writing sensation stories, for in those dark



<P>ages, even all-perfect America read rubbish.&nbsp; She told no one,



<P>but concocted a `thrilling tale', and boldly carried it herself



<P>to Mr. Dashwood, editor of the Weekly Volcano.&nbsp; She had



<P>never read Sartor Resartus, but she had a womanly instinct



<P>that clothes possess an influence more powerful over many



<P>than the worth of character or the magic of manners.&nbsp; So she



<P>dressed herself in her best, and trying to persuade herself



<P>that she was neither excited nor nervous, bravely climbed two



<P>pairs of dark and dirty stairs to find herself in a disorderly



<P>room, a cloud of cigar smoke, and the presence of three gentlemen,



<P>sitting with their heels rather higher than their hats,



<P>which articles of dress none of them took the trouble to remove



<P>on her appearance.&nbsp; somewhat daunted by this reception, Jo hesitated



<P>on the threshold, murmuring in much embarrassment...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Excuse me, I was looking for the Weekly Volcano office.



<P>I wished to see Mr. Dashwood."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Down went the highest pair of heels, up rose the smokiest



<P>gentleman, and carefully cherishing his cigar between his



<P>fingers, he advanced with a nod and a countenance expressive



<P>of nothing but sleep.&nbsp; Feeling that she must get through the



<P>matter somehow, Jo produced her manuscript and, blushing



<P>redder and redder with each sentence, blundered out fragments



<P>of the little speech carefully prepared for the occasion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A friend of mine desired me to offer--a story--just as



<P>an experiment--would like your opinion--be glad to write more



<P>if this suits."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While she blushed and blundered, Mr. Dashwood had taken



<P>the manuscript, and was turning over the leaves with a pair



<P>of rather dirty fingers, and casting critical glances up and



<P>down the neat pages.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not a first attempt, I take it?" observing that the



<P>pages were numbered, covered only on one side, and not tied



<P>up with a ribbon--sure sign of a novice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, sir.&nbsp; She has had some experience, and got a prize



<P>for a tale in the BLARNEYSTONE BANNER."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, did she?" And Mr. Dashwood gave JO a quick look,



<P>which seemed to take note of everything she had on, from the



<P>bow in her bonnet to the buttons on her boots.&nbsp; "Well, you



<P>can leave it, if you like.&nbsp; We've more of this sort of thing



<P>on hand than we know what to do with at present, but I'll run



<P>my eye over it, and give you an answer next week."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, Jo did not like to leave it, for Mr. Dashwood didn't



<P>suit her at all, but, under the circumstances, there was nothing



<P>for her to do but bow and walk away, looking particularly tall



<P>and dignified, as she was apt to do when nettled or abashed.



<P>Just then she was both, for it was perfectly evident from the



<P>knowing glances exchanged among the gentlemen that her little



<P>fiction of `my friend' was considered a good joke, and a



<P>laugh, produced by some inaudible remark of the editor, as



<P>he closed the door, completed her discomfiture.&nbsp; Half resolving



<P>never to return, she went home, and worked off her



<P>irritation by stitching pinafores vigorously, and in an



<P>hour or two was cool enough to laugh over the scene and long



<P>for next week.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When she went again, Mr. Dashwood was alone, whereat she



<P>rejoiced.&nbsp; Mr. Dashwood was much wider awake than before,



<P>which was agreeable and Mr. Dashwood was not too deeply absorbed



<P>in a cigar to remember his manners, so the second



<P>interview was much more comfortable than the first.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We'll take this (editors never say I), if you don't



<P>object to a few alterations.&nbsp; It's too long, but omitting



<P>the passages I've marked will make it just the right length,"



<P>he said, in a businesslike tone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo hardly knew her own MS again, so crumpled and underscored



<P>were its pages and paragraphs, but feeling as a tender



<P>patent might on being asked to cut off her baby's legs in



<P>order that it might fit into a new cradle, she looked at the



<P>marked passages and was surprised to find that all the moral



<P>reflections--which she had carefully put in as ballast for



<P>much romance--had been stricken out.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But, Sir, I thought every story should have some sort of



<P>a moral, so I took care to have a few of my sinners repent."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Dashwoods's editorial gravity relaxed into a smile, for



<P>Jo had forgotten her `friend', and spoken as only an author



<P>could.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"People want to be amused, not preached at, you know.&nbsp; Morals



<P>don't sell nowadays."&nbsp; Which was not quite a correct statement,



<P>by the way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You think it would do with these alterations, then?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, it's a new plot, and pretty well worked up--language



<P>good, and so on," was Mr. Dashwood's affable reply.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What do you--that is, what compensation--" began Jo, not



<P>exactly knowing how to express herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, yes, well, we give from twenty-five to thirty for



<P>things of this sort.&nbsp; Pay when it comes out," returned Mr. Dashwood,



<P>as if that point had escaped him.&nbsp; Such trifles do escape



<P>the editorial mind, it is said.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very well, you can have it," said Jo, handing back the



<P>story with a satisfied air, for after the dollar-a-column work,



<P>even twenty-five seemed good pay.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Shall I tell my friend you will take another if she has one



<P>better than this?" asked Jo, unconscious of her little slip of



<P>the tongue, and emboldened by her success.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, we'll look at it.&nbsp; Can't promise to take it.&nbsp; Tell

her



<P>to make it short and spicy, and never mind the moral.&nbsp; What name



<P>would your friend like to put on it?" in a careless tone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"None at all, if you please, she doesn't wish her name to



<P>appear and has no nom de plume," said Jo, blushing in spite of



<P>herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Just as she likes, of course.&nbsp; The tale will be out next week.



<P>Will you call for the money, or shall I send it?" asked Mr. Dashwood,



<P>who felt a natural desire to know who his new contributor might be.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll call.&nbsp; Good morning, Sir."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As she departed, Mr. Dashwood put up his feet, with the graceful



<P>remark, "Poor and proud, as usual, but she'll do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Following Mr. Dashwood's directions, and making Mrs. Northbury



<P>her model, Jo rashly took a plunge into the frothy sea of sensational



<P>literature, but thanks to the life preserver thrown her by a friend,



<P>she came up again not much the worse for her ducking.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Like most young scribblers, she went abroad for her characters



<P>and scenery, and banditti, counts, gypsies, nuns, and duchesses



<P>appeared upon her stage, and played their parts with as



<P>much accuracy and spirit as could be expected.&nbsp; Her readers



<P>were not particular about such trifles as grammar, punctuation,



<P>and probability, and Mr. Dashwood graciously permitted her to



<P>fill his columns at the lowest prices, not thinking it necessary



<P>to tell her that the real cause of his hospitality was the



<P>fact that one of his hacks, on being offered higher wages, had



<P>basely left him in the lurch.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She soon became interested in her work, for her emaciated



<P>purse grew stout, and the little hoard she was making to take



<P>Beth to the mountains next summer grew slowly but surely as



<P>the weeks passed.&nbsp; One thing disturbed her satisfaction, and



<P>that was that she did not tell them at home.&nbsp; She had a feeling



<P>that Father and Mother would not approve, and preferred to have



<P>her own way first, and beg pardon afterward.&nbsp; It was easy to



<P>keep her secret, for no name appeared with her stories.&nbsp; Mr.



<P>Dashwood had of course found it out very soon, but promised



<P>to be dumb, and for a wonder kept his word.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She thought it would do her no harm, for she sincerely



<P>meant to write nothing of which she would be ashamed, and



<P>quieted all pricks of conscience by anticipations of the



<P>happy minute when she should show her earnings and laugh over



<P>her well-kept secret.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Mr. Dashwood rejected any but thrilling tales, and as



<P>thrills could not be produced except by harrowing up the souls



<P>of the readers, history and romance, land and sea, science and



<P>art, police records and lunatic asylums, had to be ransacked



<P>for the purpose.&nbsp; Jo soon found that her innocent experience



<P>had given her but few glimpses of the tragic world which



<P>underlies society, so regarding it in a business light, she set



<P>about supplying her deficiencies with characteristic energy.



<P>Eager to find material for stories, and bent on making them



<P>original in plot, if not masterly in execution, she searched



<P>newspapers for accidents, incidents, and crimes.&nbsp; She excited



<P>the suspicions of public librarians by asking for works on



<P>poisons.&nbsp; She studied faces in the street, and characters,



<P>good, bad, and indifferent, all about her.&nbsp; She delved in



<P>the dust of ancient times for facts or fictions so old that



<P>they were as good as new, and introduced herself to folly, sin,



<P>and misery, as well as her limited opportunities allowed.&nbsp; She



<P>thought she was prospering finely, but unconsciously she was



<P>beginning to desecrate some of the womanliest attributes of a



<P>woman's character.&nbsp; She was living in bad society, and imaginary



<P>though it was, its influence affected her, for she was



<P>feeding heart and fancy on dangerous and unsubstantial food,



<P>and was fast brushing the innocent bloom from her nature by



<P>a premature acquaintance with the darker side of life, which



<P>comes soon enough to all of us.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was beginning to feel rather than see this, for much



<P>describing of other people's passions and feelings set her



<P>to studying and speculating about her own.&nbsp; a morbid amusement



<P>in which healthy young minds do not voluntarily indulge.



<P>Wrongdoing always brings its own punishment, and when Jo



<P>most needed hers, she got it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I don't know whether the study of Shakespeare helped her



<P>to read character, or the natural instinct of a woman for what



<P>was honest, brave, and strong, but while endowing her imaginary



<P>heroes with every perfection under the sun, Jo was discovering



<P>a live hero, who interested her in spite of many human imperfections.



<P>Mr. Bhaer, in one of their conversations, had advised



<P>her to study simple, true, and lovely characters, wherever she



<P>found them, as good training for a writer.&nbsp; Jo took him at his



<P>word, for she coolly turned round and studied him--a proceeding



<P>which would have much surprised him, had he know it, for the



<P>worthy Professor was very humble in his own conceit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Why everybody liked him was what puzzled Jo, at first.&nbsp; He



<P>was neither rich nor great, young nor handsome, in no respect



<P>what is called fascinating, imposing, or brilliant, and yet



<P>he was as attractive as a genial fire, and people seemed to



<P>gather about him as naturally as about a warm hearth.&nbsp; He was



<P>poor, yet always appeared to be giving something away; a



<P>stranger, yet everyone was his friend; no longer young, but



<P>as happy-hearted as a boy; plain and peculiar, yet his face



<P>looked beautiful to many, and his oddities were freely forgiven



<P>for his sake.&nbsp; Jo often watched him, trying to discover



<P>the charm, and at last decided that it was benevolence which



<P>worked the miracle.&nbsp; If he had any sorrow, `it sat with its



<P>head under its wing', and he turned only his sunny side to the



<P>world.&nbsp; There were lines upon his forehead, but Time seemed



<P>to have touched him gently, remembering how kind he was to



<P>others.&nbsp; The pleasant curves about his mouth were the memorials



<P>of many friendly words and cheery laughs, his eyes were never



<P>cold or hard, and his big hand had a warm, strong grasp



<P>that was more expressive than words.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His very clothes seemed to partake of the hospitable nature



<P>of the wearer.&nbsp; They looked as if they were at ease, and liked



<P>to make him comfortable.&nbsp; His capacious waistcoat was sugges-



<P>tive of a large heart underneath.&nbsp; His rusty coat had a social



<P>air, and the baggy pockets plainly proved that little hands



<P>often went in empty and came out full.&nbsp; His very boots were



<P>benevolent, and his collars never stiff and raspy like other people's.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's it!" said Jo to herself, when she at length discovered



<P>that genuine good will toward one's fellow men could beautify



<P>and dignify even a stout German teacher, who shoveled in his dinner,



<P>darned his own socks, and was burdened with the name of Bhaer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo valued goodness highly, but she also possessed a most



<P>feminine respect for intellect, and a little discovery which



<P>she made about the Professor added much to her regard for him.



<P>He never spoke of himself, and no one ever knew that in his



<P>native city he had been a man much honored and esteemed for



<P>learning and integrity, till a countryman came to see him.



<P>He never spoke of himself, and in a conversation with Miss



<P>Norton divulged the pleasing fact.&nbsp; From her Jo learned it,



<P>and liked it all the better because Mr. Bhaer had never told



<P>it.&nbsp; She felt proud to know that he was an honored Professor



<P>in Berlin, though only a poor language-master in America,



<P>and his homely, hard-working life was much beautified by the



<P>spice of romance which this discovery gave it.



<P>Another and a better gift than intellect was shown her in



<P>a most unexpected manner.&nbsp; Miss Norton had the entree into



<P>most society, which Jo would have had no chance of seeing but



<P>for her.&nbsp; The solitary woman felt an interest in the ambitious



<P>girl, and kindly conferred many favors of this sort both on Jo



<P>and the Professor.&nbsp; She took them with her one night to a select



<P>symposium, held in honor of several celebrities.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo went prepared to bow down and adore the mighty ones



<P>whom she had worshiped with youthful enthusiasm afar off.&nbsp; But



<P>her reverence for genius received a severe shock that night,



<P>and it took her some time to recover from the discovery that



<P>the great creatures were only men and women after all.&nbsp; Imagine



<P>her dismay, on stealing a glance of timid admiration at the



<P>poet whose lines suggested an ethereal being fed on `spirit,



<P>fire, and dew', to behold him devouring his supper with an



<P>ardor which flushed his intellectual countenance.&nbsp; Turning



<P>as from a fallen idol, she made other discoveries which



<P>rapidly dispelled her romantic illusions.&nbsp; The great novelist



<P>vibrated between two decanters with the regularity of a pendulum;



<P>the famous divine flirted openly with one of the



<P>Madame de Staels of the age, who looked daggers at another



<P>Corinne, who was amiably satirizing her, after outmaneuvering



<P>her in efforts to absorb the profound philosopher, who imbibed



<P>tea Johnsonianly and appeared to slumber, the loquacity of the



<P>lady rendering speech impossible.&nbsp; The scientific celebrities,



<P>forgetting their mollusks and glacial periods, gossiped about



<P>art, while devoting themselves to oysters and ices with



<P>characteristic energy; the young musician, who was charming



<P>the city like a second Orpheus, talked horses; and the specimen



<P>of the British nobility present happened to be the most ordinary



<P>man of the party.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Before the evening was half over, Jo felt so completely



<P>disillusioned, that she sat down in a corner to recover herself.



<P>Mr. Bhaer soon joined her, looking rather out of his element,



<P>and presently several of the philosophers, each mounted on his



<P>hobby, came ambling up to hold an intellectual tournament in



<P>the recess.&nbsp; The conversations were miles beyond Jo's comprehension,



<P>but she enjoyed it, though Kant and Hegel were unknown



<P>gods, the Subjective and Objective unintelligible terms, and



<P>the only thing `evolved from her inner consciousness' was a



<P>bad headache after it was all over.&nbsp; It dawned upon her gradually



<P>that the world was being picked to pieces, and put together on



<P>new and, according to the talkers, on infinitely better principles



<P>than before, that religion was in a fair way to be



<P>reasoned into nothingness, and intellect was to be the only



<P>God.&nbsp; Jo knew nothing about philosophy or metaphysics of any



<P>sort, but a curious excitement, half pleasurable, half painful,



<P>came over her as she listened with a sense of being turned



<P>adrift into time and space, like a young balloon out on a holiday.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She looked round to see how the Professor liked it, and



<P>found him looking at her with the grimest expression she had



<P>ever seen him wear.&nbsp; He shook his head and beckoned her to



<P>come away, but she was fascinated just then by the freedom



<P>of Speculative Philosophy, and kept her seat, trying to find



<P>out what the wise gentlemen intended to rely upon after



<P>they had annihilated all the old beliefs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, Mr. Bhaer was a diffident man and slow to offer his



<P>own opinions, not because they were unsettled, but too sincere



<P>and earnest to be lightly spoken.&nbsp; As he glanced from Jo



<P>to several other young people, attracted by the brilliancy



<P>of the philosophic pyrotechnics, he knit his brows and longed



<P>to speak, fearing that some inflammable young soul would be



<P>led astray by the rockets, to find when the display was over



<P>that they had only an empty stick or a scorched hand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He bore it as long as he could, but when he was appealed



<P>to for an opinion, he blazed up with honest indignation and



<P>defended religion with all the eloquence of truth--an eloquence



<P>which made his broken English musical and his plain



<P>face beautiful.&nbsp; He had a hard fight, for the wise men argued



<P>well, but he didn't know when he was beaten and stood to his



<P>colors like a man.&nbsp; Somehow, as he talked, the world got



<P>right again to Jo.&nbsp; The old beliefs, that had lasted so long,



<P>seemed better than the new.&nbsp; God was not a blind force, and



<P>immortality was not a pretty fable, but a blessed fact.&nbsp; She



<P>felt as if she had solid ground under her feet again, and



<P>when Mr. Bhaer paused, outtalked but not one whit convinced,



<P>Jo wanted to clap her hands and thank him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She did neither, but she remembered the scene, and gave



<P>the Professor her heartiest respect, for she knew it cost him



<P>an effort to speak out then and there, because his conscience



<P>would not let him be silent.&nbsp; She began to see that character



<P>is a better possession than money, rank, intellect, or beauty,



<P>and to feel that if greatness is what a wise man has defined



<P>it to be, `truth, reverence, and good will', then her friend



<P>friedrich Bhaer was not only good, but great.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This belief strengthened daily.&nbsp; She valued his esteem,



<P>she coveted his respect, she wanted to be worthy of his friendship,



<P>and just when the wish was sincerest, she came near to



<P>losing everything.&nbsp; It all grew out of a cocked hat, for one



<P>evening the Professor came in to give Jo her lesson with a



<P>paper soldier cap on his head, which Tina had put there and



<P>he had forgotten to take off.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's evident he doesn't look in his glass before coming



<P>down," thought Jo, with a smile, as he said "Goot efening,"



<P>and sat soberly down, quite unconscious of the ludicrous



<P>contrast between his subject and his headgear, for he was



<P>going to read her the Death of Wallenstein.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She said nothing at first, for she liked to hear him laugh



<P>out his big, hearty laugh when anything funny happened, so she



<P>left him to discover it for himself, and presently forgot all



<P>about it, for to hear a German read Schiller is rather an absorbing



<P>occupation.&nbsp; After the reading came the lesson, which



<P>was a lively one, for Jo was in a gay mood that night, and



<P>the cocked hat kept her eyes dancing with merriment.&nbsp; The



<P>Professor didn't know what to make of her, and stopped at



<P>last to ask with an air of mild surprise that was irresistible



<P>...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mees Marsch, for what do you laugh in your master's face?



<P>Haf you no respect for me, that you go on so bad?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How can I be respectful, Sir, when you forget to take



<P>your hat off?" said Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lifting his hand to his head, the absent-minded Professor



<P>gravely felt and removed the little cocked hat, looked at it a



<P>minute, and then threw back his head and laughed like a merry



<P>bass viol.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah!&nbsp; I see him now, it is that imp Tina who makes me a



<P>fool with my cap.&nbsp; Well, it is nothing, but see you, if this



<P>lesson goes not well, you too shall wear him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But the lesson did not go at all for a few minutes because



<P>Mr. Bhaer caught sight of a picture on the hat, and unfolding it,



<P>said with great disgust, "I wish these papers did not come in the house.



<P>They are not for children to see,&nbsp; nor young people to read.



<P>It is not well, and I haf no patience with those who make this harm."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo glanced at the sheet and saw a pleasing illustration



<P>composed of a lunatic, a corpse, a villian, and a viper.&nbsp; She



<P>did not like it, but the impulse that made her turn it over



<P>was not one of displeasure but fear, because for a minute



<P>she fancied the paper was the Volcano.&nbsp; It was not, however,



<P>and her panic subsided as she remembered that even if it



<P>had been and one of her own tales in it, there would have



<P>been no name to betray her.&nbsp; She had betrayed herself, however,



<P>by a look and a blush, for though an absent man, the



<P>Professor saw a good deal more than people fancied.&nbsp; He



<P>knew that Jo wrote, and had met her down among the newspaper



<P>offices more than once, but as she never spoke of it,



<P>he asked no questions in spite of a strong desire to see her



<P>work.&nbsp; Now it occurred to him that she was doing what she



<P>was ashamed to own, and it troubled him.&nbsp; He did not say to



<P>himself, "It is none of my business.&nbsp; I've no right to say



<P>anything," as many people would have done.&nbsp; He only remembered



<P>that she was young and poor, a girl far away from



<P>mother's love and father's care, and he was moved to help



<P>her with an impulse as quick and natural as that which



<P>would prompt him to put out his hand to save a baby from



<P>a puddle.&nbsp; All this flashed through his mind in a minute,



<P>but not a trace of it appeared in his face, and by the



<P>time the paper was turned, and Jo's needle threaded, he



<P>was ready to say quite naturally, but very gravely...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, you are right to put it from you.&nbsp; I do not think



<P>that good young girls should see such things.&nbsp; They are made



<P>pleasant to some, but I would more rather give my boys gunpowder



<P>to play with than this bad trash."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"All may not be bad, only silly, you know, and if there



<P>is a demand for it, I don't see any harm in supplying it.



<P>Many very respectable people make an honest living out of



<P>what are called sensation stories," said Jo, scratching gathers



<P>so energetically that a row of little slits followed her pin.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is a demand for whisky, but I think you and I do



<P>not care to sell it.&nbsp; If the respectable people knew what harm



<P>they did, they would not feel that the living was honest.&nbsp; They



<P>haf no right to put poison in the sugarplum, and let the small



<P>ones eat it.&nbsp; No, they should think a little, and sweep mud in



<P>the street before they do this thing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Bhaer spoke warmly, and walked to the fire, crumpling



<P>the paper in his hands.&nbsp; Jo sat still, looking as if the fire



<P>had come to her, for her cheeks burned long after the cocked



<P>hat had turned to smoke and gone harmlessly up the chimney.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I should like much to send all the rest after him," muttered



<P>the Professor, coming back with a relieved air.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo thought what a blaze her pile of papers upstairs would



<P>make, and her hard-earned money lay rather heavily on her conscience



<P>at that minute.&nbsp; Then she thought consolingly to herself,



<P>"Mine are not like that, they are only silly, never bad,



<P>so I won't be worried," and taking up her book, she said,



<P>with a studious face, "Shall we go on, Sir?&nbsp; I'll be very



<P>good and proper now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall hope so," was all he said, but he meant more than



<P>she imagined, and the grave, kind look he gave her made her



<P>feel as if the words Weekly Volcano were printed in large



<P>type on her forehead.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As soon as she went to her room, she got out her papers,



<P>and carefully reread every one of her stories.&nbsp; Being a little



<P>shortsighted, Mr. Bhaer sometimes used eye glasses, and Jo



<P>had tried them once, smiling to see how they magnified the



<P>fine print of her book.&nbsp; Now she seemed to have on the Professor's



<P>mental or moral spectacles also, for the faults of these



<P>poor stories glared at her dreadfully and filled her with dismay.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They are trash, and will soon be worse trash if I go



<P>on, for each is more sensational than the last.&nbsp; I've gone



<P>blindly on, hurting myself and other people, for the sake of



<P>money.&nbsp; I know it's so, for I can't read this stuff in sober



<P>earnest without being horribly ashamed of it, and what should



<P>I do if they were seen at home or Mr. Bhaer got hold of them?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo turned hot at the bare idea, and stuffed the whole bundle



<P>into her stove, nearly setting the chimney afire with the blaze.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, that's the best place for such inflammable nonsense.



<P>I'd better burn the house down, I suppose, than let other



<P>people blow themselves up with my gunpowder," she thought as



<P>she watched the Demon of the Jura whisk away, a little black



<P>cinder with fiery eyes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But when nothing remained of all her three month's work



<P>except a heap of ashes and the money in her lap, Jo looked



<P>sober, as she sat on the floor, wondering what she ought to



<P>do about her wages.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think I haven't done much harm yet, and may keep this



<P>to pay for my time," she said, after a long meditation, adding



<P>impatiently, "I almost wish I hadn't any conscience, it's so



<P>inconvenient.&nbsp; If I didn't care about doing right, and didn't



<P>feel uncomfortable when doing wrong, I should get on capitally.



<P>I can't help wishing sometimes, that Mother and Father hadn't



<P>been so particular about such things."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Ah, Jo, instead of wishing that, thank God that `Father



<P>and Mother were particular'.&nbsp; and pity from your heart those



<P>who have no such guardians to hedge them round with principles



<P>which may seem like prison walls to impatient youth,



<P>but which will prove sure foundations to build character upon



<P>in womanhood.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo wrote no more sensational stories, deciding that the



<P>money did not pay for her share of the sensation, but going



<P>to the other extreme, as is the way with people of her stamp,



<P>she took a course of Mrs. Sherwood, Miss Edgeworth, and Hannah



<P>More, and then produced a tale which might have been more



<P>properly called an essay or a sermon, so intensely moral



<P>was it.&nbsp; She had her doubts about it from the beginning, for



<P>her lively fancy and girlish romance felt as ill at ease in the



<P>new style as she would have done masquerading in the stiff



<P>and cumbrous costume of the last century.&nbsp; She sent this didactic



<P>gem to several markets, but it found no purchaser,



<P>and she was inclined to agree with Mr. Dashwood that morals



<P>didn't sell.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then she tried a child's story, which she could easily have



<P>disposed of if she had not been mercenary enough to demand filthy



<P>lucre for it.&nbsp; The only person who offered enough to make it



<P>worth her while to try juvenile literature was a worthy gentleman



<P>who felt it his mission to convert all the world to his



<P>particular belief.&nbsp; But much as she liked to write for children,



<P>Jo could not consent to depict all her naughty boys as



<P>being eaten by bears or tossed by mad bulls because they did



<P>not go to a particular Sabbath school, nor all the good infants



<P>who did go as rewarded by every kind of bliss, from gilded



<P>gingerbread to escorts of angels when they departed this life



<P>with psalms or sermons on their lisping tongues.&nbsp; So nothing



<P>came of these trials, land Jo corked up her inkstand, and



<P>said in a fit of very wholesome humility...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't know anything.&nbsp; I'll wait until I do before I try



<P>again, and meantime, `sweep mud in the street' if I can't do



<P>better, that's honest, at least."&nbsp; Which decision proved that



<P>her second tumble down the beanstalk had done her some good.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While these internal revolutions were going on, her external



<P>life had been as busy and uneventful as usual, and if she



<P>sometimes looked serious or a little sad no one observed



<P>it but Professor Bhaer.&nbsp; He did it so quietly that Jo never



<P>knew he was watching to see if she would accept and profit by



<P>his reproof, but she stood the test, and he was satisfied, for



<P>though no words passed between them, he knew that she had



<P>given up writing.&nbsp; Not only did he guess it by the fact that



<P>the second finger of her right hand was no longer inky, but



<P>she spent her evenings downstairs now, was met no more among



<P>newspaper offices, and studied with a dogged patience, which



<P>assured him that she was bent on occupying her mind with



<P>something useful, if not pleasant.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He helped her in many ways, proving himself a true friend,



<P>and Jo was happy, for while her pen lay idle, she was learning



<P>other lessons besides German, and laying a foundation for the



<P>sensation story of her own life.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was a pleasant winter and a long one, for she did not



<P>leave Mrs. Kirke till June.&nbsp; Everyone seemed sorry when the time



<P>came.&nbsp; The children were inconsolable, and Mr. Bhaer's hair



<P>stuck straight up all over his head, for he always rumpled it



<P>wildly when disturbed in mind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Going home?&nbsp; Ah, you are happy that you haf a home to go



<P>in," he said, when she told him, and sat silently pulling his



<P>beard in the corner, while she held a little levee on that last



<P>evening.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was going early, so she bade them all goodbye overnight,



<P>and when his turn came, she said warmly, "Now, Sir, you won't



<P>forget to come and see us, if you ever travel our way, will you?



<P>I'll never forgive you if you do, for I want them all to know my



<P>friend."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you?&nbsp; Shall I come?" he asked, looking down at her with



<P>an eager expression which she did not see.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, come next month.&nbsp; Laurie graduates then, and you'd



<P>enjoy commencement as something new."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That is your best friend, of whom you speak?" he said in



<P>an altered tone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, my boy Teddy.&nbsp; I'm very proud of him and should like



<P>you to see him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo looked up then, quite unconscious of anything but her



<P>own pleasure in the prospect of showing them to one another.



<P>Something in Mr. Bhaer's face suddenly recalled the fact that



<P>she might find Laurie more than a `best friend', and simply



<P>because she particularly wished not to look as if anything was



<P>the matter, she involuntarily began to blush, and the more she



<P>tried not to, the redder she grew.&nbsp; If it had not been for Tina



<P>on her knee.&nbsp; She didn't know what would have become of her.



<P>Fortunately the child was moved to hug her, so she managed to



<P>hide her face an instant, hoping the Professor did not see it.



<P>But he did, and his own changed again from that momentary anxiety



<P>to its usual expression, as he said cordially...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I fear I shall not make the time for that, but I wish the friend



<P>much success, and you all happiness.&nbsp; Gott bless you!"&nbsp; And

with that,



<P>he shook hands warmly, shouldered Tina, and went away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But after the boys were abed, he sat long before his fire



<P>with the tired look on his face and the `heimweh', or homesickness,



<P>lying heavy at his heart.&nbsp; Once, when he remembered



<P>Jo as she sat with the little child in her lap and that new



<P>softness in her face, he leaned his head on his hands a minute,



<P>and then roamed about the room, as if in search of something



<P>that he could not find.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is not for me, I must not hope it now," he said to himself,



<P>with a sigh that was almost a groan.&nbsp; Then, as if reproach-



<P>ing himself for the longing that he could not repress, he went



<P>and kissed the two tousled heads upon the pillow, took down his



<P>seldom-used meerschaum, and opened his Plato.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He did his best and did it manfully, but I don't think he found



<P>that a pair of rampant boys, a pipe, or even the divine Plato,



<P>were very satisfactory substitutes for wife and child at home.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Early as it was, he was at the station next morning to see



<P>Jo off, and thanks to him, she began her solitary journey with



<P>the pleasant memory of a familiar face smiling its farewell, a



<P>bunch of violets to keep her company, and best of all, the happy



<P>thought, "Well, the winter's gone, and I've written no books,



<P>earned no fortune, but I've made a friend worth having and I'll



<P>try to keep him all my life."

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Girls, where are you going?" asked Amy, coming into their



<P>room one Saturday afternoon, and finding them getting ready to



<P>go out with an air of secrecy which excited her curiosity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Never mind.&nbsp; Little girls shouldn't ask questions," returned



<P>Jo sharply.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now if there is anything mortifying to out feelings when we



<P>are young, it is to be told that, and to be bidden to "run away,



<P>dear" is still more trying to us.&nbsp; Amy bridled up at this insult,



<P>and determined to find out the secret, if she teased for an hour.



<P>Turning to Meg, who never refused her anything very long, she said



<P>coaxingly, "Do tell me! I should think you might let me go, too,



<P>for Beth is fussing over her piano, and I haven't got anything to



<P>do, and am so lonely."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I can't, dear, because you aren't invited," began Meg, but



<P>Jo broke in impatiently, "Now, Meg, be quiet or you will spoil it



<P>all.&nbsp; You can't go, Amy, so don't be a baby and whine about it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are going somewhere with Laurie, I know you are.&nbsp; You



<P>were whispering and laughing together on the sofa last night, and



<P>you stopped when I came in.&nbsp; Aren't you going with him?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, we are.&nbsp; Now do be still, and stop bothering."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy held her tongue, but used her eyes, and saw Meg slip a



<P>fan into her pocket.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I know!&nbsp; I know!&nbsp; You're going to the theater to see the



<P>SEVEN CASTLES!" she cried, adding resolutely, "and I shall go,



<P>for Mother said I might see it, and I've got my rag money, and



<P>it was mean not to tell me in time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Just listen to me a minute, and be a good child," said Meg



<P>soothingly.&nbsp; "Mother doesn't wish you to go this week, because



<P>your eyes are not well enough yet to bear the light of this



<P>fairy piece.&nbsp; Next week you can go with Beth and Hannah, and



<P>have a nice time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't like that half as well as going with you and Laurie.



<P>Please let me.&nbsp; I've been sick with this cold so long, and shut



<P>up, I'm dying for some fun.&nbsp; Do, Meg!&nbsp; I'll be ever so good,"



<P>pleaded Amy, looking as pathetic as she could.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Suppose we take her.&nbsp; I don't believe Mother would mind,



<P>if we bundle her up well," began Meg.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If she goes I shan't, and if I don't, Laurie won't like it,



<P>and it will be very rude, after he invited only us, to go and



<P>drag in Amy.&nbsp; I should think she'd hate to poke herself where



<P>she isn't wanted," said Jo crossly, for she disliked the trouble



<P>of overseeing a fidgety child when she wanted to enjoy herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her tone and manner angered Amy, who began to put her boots



<P>on, saying, in her most aggravating way, "I shall go.&nbsp; Meg says

I



<P>may, and if I pay for myself, Laurie hasn't anything to do with it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You can't sit with us, for our seats are reserved, and you



<P>mustn't sit alone, so Laurie will give you his place, and that



<P>will spoil our pleasure.&nbsp; Or he'll get another seat for you, and



<P>that isn't proper when you weren't asked.&nbsp; You shan't stir a



<P>step, so you may just stay where you are," scolded Jo, crosser



<P>than ever, having just pricked her finger in her hurry.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sitting on the floor with one boot on, Amy began to cry



<P>and Meg to reason with her, when Laurie called from below, and



<P>the two girls hurried down, leaving their sister wailing.&nbsp; For



<P>now and then she forgot her grown-up ways and acted like a



<P>spoiled child.&nbsp; Just as the party was setting out, Amy called



<P>over the banisters in a threatening tone, "You'll be sorry for



<P>this, Jo March, see if you ain't."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Fiddlesticks!" returned Jo, slamming the door.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They had a charming time, for THE SEVEN CASTLES OF THE



<P>DIAMOND LAKE was as brilliant and wonderful as heart could wish.



<P>But in spite of the comical red imps, sparkling elves, and the



<P>gorgeous princes and princesses, Jo's pleasure had a drop of



<P>bitterness in it.&nbsp; The fairy queen's yellow curls reminded her



<P>of Amy, and between the acts she amused herself with wondering



<P>what her sister would do to make her `sorry for it'.&nbsp; She and



<P>Amy had had many lively skirmishes in the course of their lives,



<P>for both had quick tempers and were apt to be violent when fairly



<P>roused.&nbsp; Amy teased Jo, and Jo irritated Amy, and semioccasional



<P>explosions occurred, of which both were much ashamed afterward.



<P>Although the oldest, Jo had the least self-control, and had hard



<P>times trying to curb the fiery spirit which was continually getting



<P>her into trouble.&nbsp; Her anger never lasted long, and having humbly



<P>confessed her fault, she sincerely repented and tried to do better.



<P>Her sisters used to say that they rather liked to get Jo into a



<P>fury because she was such an angel afterward.&nbsp; Poor Jo tried



<P>desperately to be good, but her bosom enemy was always ready to



<P>flame up and defeat her, and it took years of patient effort to



<P>subdue it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When they got home, they found amy reading in the parlor.



<P>She assumed an injured air as they came in, never lifted her eyes



<P>from her book, or asked a single question.&nbsp; Perhaps curiosity



<P>might have conquered resentment, if Beth had not been there to



<P>inquire and receive a glowing description of the play.&nbsp; On going



<P>up to put away her best hat, Jo's first look was toward the



<P>bureau, for in their last quarrel Amy had soothed her feelings



<P>by turning Jo's top drawer upside down on the floor.&nbsp; Everything



<P>was in its place, however, and after a hasty glance into her



<P>various closets, bags, and boxes, Jo decided that Amy had



<P>forgiven and forgotten her wrongs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There Jo was mistaken, for next day she made a discovery



<P>which produced a tempest.&nbsp; Meg, Beth, and Amy were sitting together,



<P>late in the afternoon, when Jo burst into the room, looking excited



<P>and demanding breathlessly, "Has anyone taken my book?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg and Beth said, "No." at once, and looked surprised.&nbsp; Amy



<P>poked the fire and said nothing.&nbsp; Jo saw her color rise and was



<P>down upon her in a minute.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Amy, you've got it!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I haven't."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You know where it is, then!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I don't."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's a fib!" cried Jo, taking her by the shoulders, and



<P>looking fierce enough to frighten a much braver child than Amy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It isn't.&nbsp; I haven't got it, don't know where it is now, and



<P>don't care."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You know something about it, and you'd better tell at once,



<P>or I'll make you."&nbsp; And Jo gave her a slight shake.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Scold as much as you like, you'll never see your silly old



<P>book again," cried Amy, getting excited in her turn.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"why not?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I burned it up."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What!&nbsp; My little book I was so fond of, and worked over, and



<P>meant to finish before Father got home?&nbsp; Have you really burned

it?"



<P>said Jo, turning very pale, while her eyes kindled and her hands



<P>clutched Amy nervously.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, I did!&nbsp; I told you I'd make you pay for being so cross



<P>yesterday, and I have, so..."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy got no farther, for Jo's hot temper mastered her, and



<P>she shook Amy till her teeth chattered in her head, crying in a



<P>passion of grief and anger...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You wicked, wicked girl!&nbsp; I never can write it again, and



<P>I'll never forgive you as long as I live."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg flew to rescue Amy, and Beth to pacify Jo, but Jo was



<P>quite beside herself, and with a parting box on her sister's ear,



<P>she rushed out of the room up to the old sofa in the garret, and



<P>finished her fight alone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The storm cleared up below, for Mrs. March came home, and,



<P>having heard the story, soon brought Amy to a sense of the wrong



<P>she had done her sister.&nbsp; Jo's book was the pride of her heart,



<P>and was regarded by her family as a literary sprout of great



<P>promise.&nbsp; It was only half a dozen little fairy tales, but Jo



<P>had worked over them patiently, putting her whole heart into



<P>her work, hoping to make something good enough to print.&nbsp; She



<P>had just copied them with great care, and had destroyed the old



<P>manuscript, so that Amy's bonfire had consumed the loving work



<P>of several years.&nbsp; It seemed a small loss to others, but to Jo



<P>it was a dreadful calamity, and she felt that it never could be



<P>made up to her.&nbsp; Beth mourned as for a departed kitten, and Meg



<P>refused to defend her pet.&nbsp; Mrs. March looked grave and grieved,



<P>and Amy felt that no one would love her till she had asked pardon



<P>for the act which she now regretted more than any of them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the tea bell rang, Jo appeared, looking so grim and



<P>unapproachable that it took all Amy's courage to say meekly...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Please forgive me, Jo.&nbsp; I'm very, very sorry."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I never shall forgive you," was Jo's stern answer, and



<P>from that moment she ignored Amy entirely.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>No one spoke of the great trouble, not even Mrs. March, for



<P>all had learned by experience that when Jo was in that mood words



<P>were wasted, and the wisest course was to wait till some little



<P>accident, or her own generous nature, softened Jo's resentment



<P>and healed the breach.&nbsp; It was not a happy evening, for though



<P>they sewed as usual, while their mother read aloud from Bremer,



<P>Scott, or Edgeworth, something was wanting, and the sweet home



<P>peace was disturbed.&nbsp; They felt this most when singing time came,



<P>for Beth could only play, Jo stood dumb as a stone, and Amy broke



<P>down, so Meg and Mother sang alone.&nbsp; But in spite of their efforts



<P>to be as cheery as larks, the flutelike voices did not seem to



<P>chord as well as usual, and all felt out of tune.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As Jo received her good-night kiss, Mrs. March whispered gently,



<P>"My dear, don't let the sun go down upon your anger.&nbsp; Forgive each



<P>other, help each other, and begin again tomorrow."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo wanted to lay her head down on that motherly bosom, and



<P>cry her grief and anger all away, but tears were an unmanly



<P>weakness, and she felt so deeply injured that she really couldn't



<P>quite forgive yet.&nbsp; So she winked hard, shook her head, and said



<P>gruffly because Amy was listening, "It was an abominable thing,



<P>and she doesn't deserve to be forgiven."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With that she marched off to bed, and there was no merry



<P>or confidential gossip that night.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy was much offended that her overtures of peace had been



<P>repulsed, and began to wish she had not humbled herself, to feel



<P>more injured than ever, and to plume herself on her superior



<P>virtue in a way which was particularly exasperating.&nbsp; Jo still



<P>looked like a thunder cloud, and nothing went well all day.&nbsp; It



<P>was bitter cold in the morning, she dropped her precious turnover



<P>in the gutter, Aunt March had an attack of the fidgets, Meg was



<P>sensitive, Beth would look grieved and wistful when she got home,



<P>and Amy kept making remarks about people who were always talking



<P>about being good and yet wouldn't even try when other people set



<P>them a virtuous example.



<P>"Everybody is so hateful, I'll ask Laurie to go skating.&nbsp; He



<P>is always kind and jolly, and will put me to rights, I know," said



<P>Jo to herself, and off she went.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy heard the clash of skates, and looked out with an impatient



<P>exclamation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There!&nbsp; She promised I should go next time, for this is the



<P>last ice we shall have.&nbsp; But it's no use to ask such a crosspatch



<P>to take me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't say that.&nbsp; You were very naughty, and it is hard to



<P>forgive the loss of her precious little book, but I think she



<P>might do it now, and I guess she will, if you try her at the



<P>right minute," said Meg.&nbsp; "Go after them.&nbsp; Don't say anything

till



<P>Jo has got good-natured with Laurie, than take a quiet minute and



<P>just kiss her, or do some kind thing, and I'm sure she'll be



<P>friends again with all her heart."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll try," said Amy, for the advice suited her, and after a



<P>flurry to get ready, she ran after the friends, who were just



<P>disappearing over the hill.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was not far to the river, but both were ready before Amy



<P>reached them.&nbsp; Jo saw her coming, and turned her back.&nbsp; Laurie

did



<P>not see, for he was carefully skating along the shore, sounding the



<P>ice, for a warm spell had preceded the cold snap.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll go on to the first bend, and see if it's all right before



<P>we begin to race," Amy heard him say, as he shot away, looking like



<P>a young Russian in his fur-trimmed coat and cap.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo heard Amy panting after her run, stamping her feet and



<P>blowing on her fingers as she tried to put her skates on, but Jo



<P>never turned and went slowly zigzagging down the river, taking a



<P>bitter, unhappy sort of satisfaction in her sister's troubles.



<P>She had cherished her anger till it grew strong and took possession



<P>of her, as evil thoughts and feelings always do unless cast out at



<P>once.&nbsp; As Laurie turned the bend, he shouted back...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Keep near the shore.&nbsp; It isn't safe in the middle."



<P>Jo heard, but Amy was struggling to her feet and did not catch



<P>a word.&nbsp; Jo glanced over her shoulder, and the little demon she

was



<P>harboring said in her ear...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No matter whether she heard or not, let her take care of



<P>herself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie had vanished round the bend, Jo was just at the turn,



<P>and Amy, far behind, striking out toward the the smoother ice in



<P>the middle of the river.&nbsp; For a minute Jo stood still with a



<P>strange feeling in her heart, then she resolved to go on, but



<P>something held and turned her round, just in time to see Amy throw



<P>up her hands and go down, with a sudden crash of rotten ice, the



<P>splash of water, and a cry that made Jo's heart stand still with



<P>fear.&nbsp; She tried to call Laurie, but her voice was gone.&nbsp;

She tried



<P>to rush forward, but her feet seemed to have no strength in them,



<P>and for a second, she could only stand motionless, staring with a



<P>terror-stricken face at the little blue hood above the black water.



<P>Something rushed swiftly by her, and Laurie's voice cried out...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Bring a rail.&nbsp; Quick, quick!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>How she did it, she never knew, but for the next few minutes



<P>she worked as if possessed, blindly obeying Laurie, who was quite



<P>self-possessed, and lying flat, held Amy up by his arm and hockey



<P>stick till Jo dragged a rail from the fence, and together they



<P>got the child out, more frightened than hurt.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now then, we must walk her home as fast as we can.&nbsp; Pile our



<P>things on her, while I get off these confounded skates," cried



<P>Laurie, wrapping his coat round Amy, and tugging away at the straps



<P>which never seemed so intricate before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Shivering, dripping, and crying, they got Amy home, and after



<P>an exciting time of it, she fell asleep, rolled in blankets before



<P>a hot fire.&nbsp; During the bustle Jo had scarcely spoken but flown



<P>about, looking pale and wild, with her things half off, her dress torn,



<P>and her hands cut and bruised by ice and rails and refractory buckles.



<P>When Amy was comfortably asleep, the house quiet,&nbsp; and Mrs. March

sitting



<P>by the bed, she called Jo to her and began to bind up the hurt hands.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Are you sure she is safe?" whispered Jo, looking remorsefully



<P>at the golden head, which might have been swept away from her sight



<P>forever under the treacherous ice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Quite safe, dear.&nbsp; she is not hurt, and won't even take cold,



<P>I think, you were so sensible in covering and getting her home



<P>quickly," replied her mother cheerfully.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Laurie did it all.&nbsp; I only let her go.&nbsp; Mother, if she should



<P>die, it would be my fault."&nbsp; And Jo dropped down beside the bed

in



<P>a passion of penitent tears, telling all that had happened, bitterly



<P>condemning her hardness of heart, and sobbing out her gratitude for



<P>being spared the heavy punishment which might have come upon her.



<P>"It's my dreadful temper!&nbsp; I try to cure it, I think I have,



<P>and then it breaks out worse than ever.&nbsp; OH, Mother, what shall

I



<P>do?&nbsp; What shall I do?" cried poor Jo, in despair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Watch and pray, dear, never get tired of trying, and never



<P>think it is impossible to conquer your fault," said Mrs. March,



<P>drawing the blowzy head to her shoulder and kissing the wet cheek



<P>so tenderly that Jo cried even harder.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You don't know, you can't guess how bad it is!&nbsp; It seems as



<P>if I could do anything when I'm in a passion.&nbsp; I get so savage,

I



<P>could hurt anyone and enjoy it.&nbsp; I'm afraid I shall do something



<P>dreadful some day, and spoil my life, and make everybody hate me.



<P>Oh, Mother, help me, do help me!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I will, my child, I will.&nbsp; Don't cry so bitterly, but remember



<P>this day, and resolve with all your soul that you will never know



<P>another like it.&nbsp; Jo, dear, we all have our temptations, some far



<P>greater than yours, and it often takes us all our lives to conquer



<P>them.&nbsp; You think your temper is the worst in the world, but mine



<P>used to be just like it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yours, Mother?&nbsp; Why, you are never angry!"&nbsp; And for the



<P>moment Jo forgot remorse in surprise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I've been trying to cure it for forty years, and have only



<P>succeeded in controlling it.&nbsp; I am angry nearly every day of my



<P>life, Jo, but I have learned not to show it, and I still hope to



<P>learn not to feel it, though it may take me another forty years



<P>to do so."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The patience and the humility of the face she loved so well



<P>was a better lesson to Jo than the wisest lecture, the sharpest



<P>reproof.&nbsp; She felt comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence



<P>given her.&nbsp; The knowledge that her mother had a fault like



<P>hers, and tried to mend it, made her own easier to bear and



<P>strengthened her resolution to cure it, though forty years seemed



<P>rather a long time to watch and pray to a girl of fifteen.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mother, are you angry when you fold your lips tight together



<P>and go out of the room sometimes, when Aunt March scolds or people



<P>worry you?" asked Jo, feeling nearer and dearer to her mother



<P>than ever before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, I've learned to check the hasty words that rise to my



<P>lips, and when I feel that they mean to break out against my will,



<P>I just go away for a minute, and give myself a little shake for



<P>being so weak and wicked," answered Mrs. March with a sigh and a



<P>smile, as she smoothed and fastened up Jo's disheveled hair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How did you learn to keep still?&nbsp; That is what troubles me,



<P>for the sharp words fly out before I know what I'm about, and the



<P>more I say the worse I get, till it's a pleasure to hurt people's



<P>feelings and say dreadful things.&nbsp; Tell me how you do it, Marmee



<P>dear."



<P>"My good mother used to help me..."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"As you do us..." interrupted Jo, with a grateful kiss.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But I lost her when I was a little older than you are, and



<P>for years had to struggle on alone, for I was too proud to confess



<P>my weakness to anyone else.&nbsp; I had a hard time, Jo, and shed a

good



<P>many bitter tears over my failures, for in spite of my efforts I



<P>never seemed to get on.&nbsp; Then your father came, and I was so happy



<P>that i found it easy to be good.&nbsp; But by-and-by, when I had four



<P>little daughters round me and we were poor, then the old trouble



<P>began again, for I am not patient by nature, and it tried me very



<P>much to see my children wanting anything."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Poor Mother!&nbsp; What helped you then?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your father, Jo.&nbsp; He never loses patience, never doubts or



<P>complains, but always hopes, and works and waits so cheerfully



<P>that one is ashamed to do otherwise before him.&nbsp; He helped and



<P>comforted me, and showed me that I must try to practice all the



<P>virtues I would have my little girls possess, for I was their



<P>example.&nbsp; It was easier to try for your sakes than for my own.



<P>A startled or surprised look from one of you when I spoke sharply



<P>rebuked me more than any words could have done, and the love,



<P>respect, and confidence of my children was the sweetest reward I



<P>could receive for my efforts to be the woman I would have them



<P>copy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, Mother, if I'm ever half as good as you, I shall be



<P>satisfied," cried Jo, much touched.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hope you will be a great deal better, dear, but you must



<P>keep watch over your `bosom enemy', as father calls it, or it



<P>may sadden, if not spoil your life.&nbsp; You have had a warning.



<P>Remember it, and try with heart and soul to master this quick



<P>temper, before it brings you greater sorrow and regret than you



<P>have known today."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I will try, Mother, I truly will.&nbsp; But you must help me,



<P>remind me, and keep me from flying out.&nbsp; I used to see Father



<P>sometimes put his finger on his lips, and look at you with a



<P>very kind but sober face, and you always folded your lips tight



<P>and went away.&nbsp; Was he reminding you then?" asked Jo softly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes.&nbsp; I asked him to help me so, and he never forgot it,



<P>but saved me from many a sharp word by that little gesture



<P>and kind look."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo saw that her mother's eyes filled and her lips trembled



<P>as she spoke, and fearing that she had said too much, she



<P>whispered anxiously, "Was it wrong to watch you and to speak of



<P>it?&nbsp; I didn't mean to be rude, but it's so comfortable to say all



<P>I think to you, and feel so safe and happy here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mu Jo, you may say anything to your mother, for it is my



<P>greatest happiness and pride to feel that my girls confide in me



<P>and know how much I love them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I thought I'd grieved you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, dear, but speaking of Father reminded me how much I



<P>miss him, how much I owe him, and how faithfully I should watch



<P>and work to keep his little daughters safe and good for him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yet you told him to go, Mother, and didn't cry when he



<P>went, and never complain now, or seem as if you needed any help,"



<P>said Jo, wondering.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I gave my best to the country I love, and kept my tears



<P>till he was gone.&nbsp; Why should I complain, when we both have



<P>merely done our duty and will surely be the happier for it in



<P>the end?&nbsp; If I don't seem to need help, it is because I have a



<P>better friend, even than Father, to comfort and sustain me.&nbsp; My



<P>child, the troubles and temptations of your life are beginning



<P>and may be many, but you can overcome and outlive them all if



<P>you learn to feel the strength and tenderness of your Heavenly



<P>Father as you do that of your earthly one.&nbsp; The more you love



<P>and trust Him, and the less you will depend on human power and



<P>wisdom.&nbsp; His love and care never tire or change, can never be



<P>taken from you, but my become the source of lifelong peace,



<P>happiness, and strength.&nbsp; Believe this heartily, and go to God



<P>with all your little cares, and hopes, and sins, and sorrows, as



<P>freely and confidingly as you come to your mother."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo's only answer was to hold her mother close, and in the



<P>silence which followed the sincerest prayer she had ever prayed



<P>left her heart without words.&nbsp; For in that sad yet happy hour,



<P>she had learned not only the bitterness of remorse and despair,



<P>but the sweetness of self-denial and self-control, and led by



<P>her mother's hand, she had drawn nearer to the Friend who always



<P>welcomes every child with a love stronger than that of any father,



<P>tenderer than that of any mother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy stirred and sighed in her sleep, and as if eager to begin



<P>at once to mend her fault, l Jo looked up with an expression on her



<P>face which it had never worn before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I let the sun go down on my anger.&nbsp; I wouldn't forgive her,



<P>and today, if it hadn't been for Laurie, it might have been too



<P>late!&nbsp; How could I be so wicked?" said Jo, half aloud, as she



<P>leaned over her sister softly stroking the wet hair scattered on



<P>the pillow.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As if she heard, Amy opened her eyes, and held out her arms,



<P>with a smile that went straight to Jo's heart.&nbsp; Neither said a



<P>word, but they hugged one another close, in spite of the blankets,



<P>and everything was forgiven and forgotten in one hearty kiss.

<P>"I do think it was the most fortunate thing in the world that



<P>those children should have the measles just now," said Meg, one



<P>April day, as she stood packing the `go abroady' trunk in her room,



<P>surrounded by her sisters.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And so nice of Annie Moffat not to forget her promise.&nbsp; A



<P>whole fortnight of fun will be regularly splendid," replied Jo,



<P>looking like a windmill as she folded skirts with her long arms.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And such lovely weather, I'm so glad of that," added Beth,



<P>tidily sorting neck and hair ribbons in her best box, lent for



<P>the great occasion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wish I was going to have a fine time and wear all these



<P>nice things," said Amy with her mouth full of pins, as she



<P>artistically replenished her sister's cushion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wish you were all going, but as you can't, I shall keep



<P>my adventures to tell you when I come back.&nbsp; I'm sure it's the



<P>least I can do when you have been so kind, lending me things



<P>and helping me get ready," said Meg, glancing round the room



<P>at the very simple outfit, which seemed nearly perfect in their



<P>eyes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What did Mother give you out of the treasure box?" asked



<P>Amy, who had not been present at the opening of a certain cedar



<P>chest in which Mrs. March kept a few relics of past splendor, as



<P>gifts for her girls when the proper time came.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A pair of silk stockings, that pretty carved fan, and a



<P>lovely blue sash.&nbsp; I wanted the violet silk, but there isn't



<P>time to make it over, so I must be contented with my old tarlatan."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It will look nice over my new muslin skirt, and the sash will



<P>set it off beautifully.&nbsp; I wish I hadn't smashed my coral bracelet,



<P>for you might have had it," said Jo, who loved to give and lend,



<P>but whose possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much



<P>use.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is a lovely old-fashioned pearl set in the treasure



<P>chest, but Mother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament



<P>for a young girl, and Laurie promised to send me all I want,"



<P>replied Meg.&nbsp; "Now, let me see, there's my new gray walking suit,



<P>just curl up the feather in my hat, Beth, then my poplin for



<P>Sunday and the small party, it looks heavy for spring, doesn't



<P>it?&nbsp; The violet silk would be so nice.&nbsp; Oh, dear!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Never mind, you've got the tarlatan for the big party, and



<P>you always look like an angel in white," said Amy, brooding



<P>over the little store of finery in which her soul delighted.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It isn't low-necked, and it doesn't sweep enough, but it



<P>will have to do.&nbsp; My blue housedress looks so well, turned and



<P>freshly trimmed, that I feel as if I'd got a new one.&nbsp; My silk



<P>sacque isn't a bit the fashion, and my bonnet doesn't look like



<P>Sallie's.&nbsp; I didn't like to say anything, but I was sadly



<P>disappointed in my umbrella.&nbsp; I told Mother black with a white



<P>handle, but she forgot and bought a green one with a yellowish



<P>handle.&nbsp; It's strong and neat, so I ought not to complain, but

I



<P>know I shall feel ashamed of it beside Annie's silk one with a



<P>gold top," sighed Meg, surveying the little umbrella with great



<P>disfavor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Change it," advised Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I won't be so silly, or hurt Marmee's feelings, when she



<P>took so much pains to get my things.&nbsp; It's a nonsensical notion



<P>of mine, and I'm not going to give up to it.&nbsp; My silk stockings



<P>and two pairs of new gloves are my comfort.&nbsp; You are a dear to



<P>lend me yours, Jo.&nbsp; I feel so rich and sort of elegant, with



<P>two new pairs, and the old ones cleaned up for common."&nbsp; And



<P>Meg took a refreshing peep at her glove box.



<P>"Annie Moffat has blue and pink bows on her nightcaps.



<P>Would you put some on mine?" she asked, as Beth brought up a



<P>pile of snowy muslins, fresh from Hannah's hands.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I wouldn't, for the smart caps won't match the plain



<P>gowns without any trimming on them.&nbsp; Poor folks shouldn't rig,"



<P>said Jo decidedly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wonder if I shall ever be happy enough to have real lace



<P>on my clothes and bows on my caps?" said Meg impatiently.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You said the other day that you'd be perfectly happy if



<P>you could only go to Annie Moffat's," observed Beth in her quiet



<P>way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So I did!&nbsp; Well, I am happy, and I won't fret, but it does



<P>seem as if the more one gets the more one wants, doesn't it?&nbsp; There



<P>now, the trays are ready, and everything in but my ball dress,



<P>which I shall leave for Mother to pack," said Meg, cheering up, as



<P>she glanced from the half-filled trunk to the many times pressed



<P>and mended white tarlatan, which she called her `ball dress' with



<P>an important air.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The next day was fine, and Meg departed in style for a fortnight



<P>of novelty and pleasure.&nbsp; Mrs. March had consented to the



<P>visit rather reluctantly, fearing that Margaret would come back



<P>more discontented than she went.&nbsp; But she begged so hard, and



<P>Sallie had promised to take good care of her, and a little pleasure



<P>seemed so delightful after a winter of irksome work that the mother



<P>yielded, and the daughter went to take her first taste of fashionable

life.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Moffats were very fashionable, and simple Meg was rather



<P>daunted, at first, by the splendor of the house and the elegance



<P>of its occupants.&nbsp; But they were kindly people, in spite of the



<P>frivolous life they led, and soon put their guest at her ease.



<P>Perhaps Meg felt, without understanding why, that they were not



<P>particularly cultivated or intelligent people, and that all their



<P>gilding could not quite conceal the ordinary material of which



<P>they were made.&nbsp; It certainly was agreeable to fare sumptuously,



<P>drive in a fine carriage, wear her best frock every day, and do



<P>nothing but enjoy herself.&nbsp; It suited her exactly, and soon she



<P>began to imitate the manners and conversation of those about her,



<P>to put on little airs and graces, use French phrases, crimp her



<P>hair, take in her dresses, and talk about the fashions as well as



<P>she could.&nbsp; The more she saw of Annie Moffat's pretty things, the



<P>more she envied her and sighed to be rich.&nbsp; Home now looked bare



<P>and dismal as she thought of it, work grew harder than ever, and



<P>she felt that she was a very destitute and much-injured girl, in



<P>spite of the new gloves and silk stockings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had not much time for repining, however, for the three



<P>young girls were busily employed in `having a good time'.&nbsp; They



<P>shopped, walked, rode, and called all day, went to theaters and



<P>operas or frolicked at home in the evening, for Annie had many



<P>friends and knew how to entertain them.&nbsp; Her older sisters were



<P>very fine young ladies, and one was engaged, which was extremely



<P>interesting and romantic, Meg thought.&nbsp; Mr. Moffat was a fat,



<P>jolly old gentleman, who knew her father, and Mrs. Moffat, a fat,



<P>jolly old lady, who took as great a fancy to Meg as her daughter



<P>had done.&nbsp; Everyone petted her, and `Daisey', as they called her,



<P>was in a fair way to have her head turned.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the evening for the small party came, she found that



<P>the poplin wouldn't do at all, for the other girls were putting



<P>on thin dresses and making themselves very fine indeed.&nbsp; So out



<P>came the tarlatan, looking older, limper, and shabbier than ever



<P>beside Sallie's crisp new one.&nbsp; Meg saw the girls glance at it



<P>and then at one another, and her cheeks began to burn, for with



<P>all her gentleness she was very proud.&nbsp; No one said a word about



<P>it, but Sallie offered to dress her hair, and Annie to tie her



<P>sash, and Belle, the engaged sister, praised her white arms.&nbsp; But



<P>in their kindness Meg saw only pity for her poverty, and her



<P>heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself, while the others



<P>laughed, chattered, and flew about like gauzy butterflies.&nbsp; The



<P>hard, bitter feeling was getting pretty bad, when the maid



<P>brought in a box of flowers.&nbsp; Before she could speak, Annie had



<P>the cover off, and all were exclaiming at the lovely roses, heath,



<P>and fern within.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's for Belle, of course, George always sends her some,



<P>but these are altogether ravishing," cried Annie, with a great



<P>sniff.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They are for Miss March, the man said.&nbsp; And here's a note,"



<P>put in the maid, holding it to Meg.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What fun!&nbsp; Who are they from?&nbsp; Didn't know you had a lover,"



<P>cried the girls, fluttering about Meg in a high state of curiosity



<P>and surprise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The note is from Mother, and the flowers from Laurie," said



<P>Meg simply, yet much gratified that he had not forgotten her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, indeed!" said Annie with a funny look, as Meg slipped



<P>the note into her pocket as a sort of talisman against envy,



<P>vanity, and false pride, for the few loving words had done her



<P>good, and the flowers cheered her up by their beauty.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Feeling almost happy again, she laid by a few ferns and roses



<P>for herself, and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for



<P>the breasts, hair, or skirts of her friends, offering them so



<P>prettily that Clara, the elder sister, told her she was `the



<P>sweetest little thing she ever saw', and they looked quite



<P>charmed with her small attention.&nbsp; Somehow the kind act finished



<P>her despondency, and when all the rest went to show themselves



<P>to Mrs. Moffat, she saw a happy, bright-eyed face in the mirror,



<P>as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair and fastened



<P>the roses in the dress that didn't strike her as so very shabby



<P>now.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She enjoyed herself very much that evening, for she danced



<P>to her heart's content.&nbsp; Everyone was very kind, and she had



<P>three compliments.&nbsp; Annie made her sing, and some one said she



<P>had a remarkably fine voice.&nbsp; Major Lincoln asked who `the fresh



<P>little girl with the beautiful eyes' was, and Mr. Moffat insisted



<P>on dancing with her because she `didn't dawdle, but had some spring



<P>in her', as he gracefully expressed it.&nbsp; So altogether she had

a



<P>very nice time, till she overheard a bit of conversation, which



<P>disturbed her extremely.&nbsp; She was sitting just inside the



<P>conservatory, waiting for her partner to bring her an ice, when she



<P>heard a voice ask on the other side of the flowery wall...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How old is he?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sixteen or seventeen, I should say," replied another voice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It would be a grand thing for one of those girls, wouldn't



<P>it?&nbsp; Sallie says they are very intimate now, and the old man quite



<P>dotes on them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mrs. M.&nbsp; has made her plans, I dare say, and will play her



<P>cards well, early as it is.&nbsp; The girl evidently doesn't think of

it



<P>yet," said Mrs. Moffat.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She told that fib about her momma, as if she did know, and



<P>colored up when the flowers came quite prettily.&nbsp; Poor thing!



<P>She'd be so nice if she was only got up in style.&nbsp; Do you think



<P>she'd be offended if we offered to lend her a dress for Thursday?"



<P>asked another voice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She's proud, but I don't believe she'd mind, for that dowdy



<P>tarlatan is all she has got.&nbsp; She may tear it tonight, and that



<P>will be a good excuse for offering a decent one."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here Meg's partner appeared, to find her looking much flushed



<P>and rather agitated.&nbsp; She was proud, and her pride was useful



<P>just then, for it helped her hide her mortification, anger, and



<P>disgust at what she had just heard.&nbsp; For, innocent and unsuspicious



<P>as she was, she could not help understanding the gossip of her



<P>friends.&nbsp; She tried to forget it, but could not, and kept repeating



<P>to herself, "Mrs. M.&nbsp; has made her plans," "that fib about her



<P>mamma," and 'dowdy tarlatan," till she was ready to cry and rush



<P>home to tell her troubles and ask for advice.&nbsp; As that was impossible,



<P>she did her best to seem gay, and being rather excited, she



<P>succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an effort she was making.



<P>She was very glad when it was all over and she was quiet in her bed,



<P>where she could think and wonder and fume till her head ached and



<P>her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears.&nbsp; Those foolish,



<P>yet well meant words, had opened a new world to Meg, and much



<P>disturbed the peace of the old one in which till now she had lived



<P>as happily as a child.&nbsp; Her innocent friendship with Laurie was



<P>spoiled by the silly speeches she had overheard.&nbsp; Her faith in

her



<P>mother was a little shaken by the worldly plans attributed to her



<P>by Mrs. Moffat, who judged others by herself, and the sensible



<P>resolution to be contented with the simple wardrobe which suited



<P>a poor man's daughter was weakened by the unnecessary pity of



<P>girls who thought a shabby dress one of the greatest calamities



<P>under heaven.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Poor Meg had a restless night, and got up heavy-eyed, unhappy,



<P>half resentful toward her friends, and half ashamed of herself for



<P>not speaking out frankly and setting everything right.&nbsp; Everybody



<P>dawdled that morning, and it was noon before the girls found



<P>energy enough even to take up their worsted work.&nbsp; Something in



<P>the manner of her friends struck Meg at once.&nbsp; They treated her



<P>with more respect, she thought, took quite a tender interest in



<P>what she said, and looked at her with eyes that plainly betrayed



<P>curiosity.&nbsp; All this surprised and flattered her, though she did



<P>not understand it till Miss Belle looked up from her writing, and



<P>said, with a sentimental air...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Daisy, dear, I've sent an invitation to your friend, Mr.



<P>Laurence, for Thursday.&nbsp; We should like to know him, and it's only



<P>a proper compliment to you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg colored, but a mischievous fancy to tease the girls made



<P>her reply demurely, "You are very kind, but I'm afraid he won't



<P>come."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why not, Cherie?" asked Miss Belle.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He's too old."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My child, what do you mean?&nbsp; What is his age, I beg to



<P>know!" cried Miss Clara.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nearly seventy, I believe," answered Meg, counting stitches



<P>to hide the merriment in her eyes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You sly creature!&nbsp; Of course we meant the young man,"



<P>exclaimed Miss Belle, laughing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There isn't any, Laurie is only a little boy."&nbsp; And Meg



<P>laughed also at the queer look which the sisters exchanged as she



<P>thus described her supposed lover.



<P>"About you age," Nan said.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nearer my sister Jo's, I am seventeen in August," returned



<P>Meg, tossing her head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's very nice of him to send you flowers, isn't it?" said



<P>Annie, looking wise about nothing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, he often does, to all of us, for their house is full, and



<P>we are so fond of them.&nbsp; My mother and old Mr. Laurence are friends,



<P>you know, so it is quite natural that we children should play together."



<P>And Meg hoped they would say no more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's evident Daisy isn't out yet," said Miss Clara to Belle with a

nod.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Quite a pastoral state of innocence all round," returned



<P>Miss Belle with a shrug.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm going out to get some little matters for my girls.&nbsp; Can



<P>I do anything for you, young ladies?" asked Mrs. Moffat, lumbering



<P>in like an elephant in silk and lace.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, thank you, ma'am," replied Sallie.&nbsp; "I've got my new



<P>pink silk for Thursday and don't want a thing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nor I..." began Meg, but stopped because it occurred to



<P>her that she did want several things and could not have them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What shall you wear?" asked Sallie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My old white one again, if I can mend it fit to be seen, it



<P>got sadly torn last night," said Meg, trying to speak quite easily,



<P>but feeling very uncomfortable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why don't you send home for another?" said Sallie, who was



<P>not an observing young lady.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I haven't got any other."&nbsp; It cost Meg an effort to say that,



<P>but Sallie did not see it and exclaimed in amiable surprise, "Only



<P>that?" How funny..."&nbsp; She did not finish her speech, for Belle



<P>shook her head at her and broke in, saying kindly...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not at all.&nbsp; Where is the use of having a lot of dresses



<P>when she isn't out yet?&nbsp; There's no need of sending home, Daisy,



<P>even if you had a dozen, for I've got a sweet blue silk laid away,



<P>which I've outgrown, and you shall wear it to please me, won't



<P>you, dear?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are very kind, but I don't mind my old dress if you



<P>don't, it does well enough for a little girl like me," said Meg.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now do let me please myself by dressing you up in style.



<P>I admire to do it, and you'd be a regular little beauty with a



<P>touch here and there.&nbsp; I shan't let anyone see you till you are



<P>done, and then we'll burst upon them like Cinderella and her



<P>godmother going to the ball," said Belle in her persuasive tone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg couldn't refuse the offer so kindly made, for a desire to



<P>see if she would be `a little beauty' after touching up caused



<P>her to accept and forget all her former uncomfortable feelings



<P>toward the Moffats.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On the Thursday evening, Belle shut herself up with her maid,



<P>and between them they turned Meg into a fine lady.&nbsp; They crimped



<P>and curled her hair, they polished her neck and arms with some



<P>fragrant powder, touched her lips with coralline salve to make



<P>them redder, and Hortense would have added `a soupcon of rouge',



<P>if Meg had not rebelled.&nbsp; They laced her into a sky-blue dress,



<P>which was so tight she could hardly breathe and so low in the



<P>neck that modest Meg blushed at herself in the mirror.&nbsp; A set



<P>of silver filagree was added, bracelets, necklace, brooch, and



<P>even earrings, for Hortense tied them on with a bit of pink



<P>silk which did not show.&nbsp; A cluster of tea-rose buds at the



<P>bosom and a ruche, reconciled Meg to the display of her pretty,



<P>white shoulders, and a pair of high-heeled silk boots satisfied



<P>the last wish of her heart.&nbsp; A lace handkerchief, a plumy fan,



<P>and a bouquet in a shoulder holder finished her off, and Miss



<P>Belle surveyed her with the satisfaction of a little girl with



<P>a newly dressed doll.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mademoiselle is chatmante, tres jolie, is she not?" cried



<P>Hortense, clasping her hands in an affected rapture.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Come and show yourself," said Miss Belle, leading the way



<P>to the room where the others were waiting.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As Meg went rustling after, with her long skirts trailing,



<P>her earrings tinkling, her curls waving, and her heart beating,



<P>she felt as if her fun had really begun at last, for the mirror



<P>had plainly told her that she was `a little beauty'.&nbsp; Her friends



<P>repeated the pleasing phrase enthusiastically, and for several



<P>minutes she stood, like a jackdaw in the fable, enjoying her



<P>borrowed plumes, while the rest chattered like a party of magpies.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"While I dress, do you drill her, Nan, in the management of her



<P>skirt and those French heels, or she will trip herself up.&nbsp; Take



<P>your silver butterfly, and catch up that long curl on the left side



<P>of her head, Clara, and don't any of you disturb the charming work



<P>of my hands," said Belle, as she hurried away, looking well pleased



<P>with her success.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You don't look a bit like yourself, but you are very nice.



<P>I'm nowhere beside you, for Belle has heaps of taste, and you're



<P>quite French, I assure you.&nbsp; Let your flowers hang, don't be so



<P>careful of them, and be sure you don't trip," returned Sallie, trying



<P>not to care that Meg was prettier than herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Keeping that warning carefully in mind, Margaret got safely



<P>downstairs and sailed into the drawing rooms where the Moffats and



<P>a few early guests were assembled.&nbsp; She very soon discovered that



<P>there is a charm about fine clothes which attracts a certain class



<P>of people and secures their respect.&nbsp; Several young ladies, who



<P>had taken no notice of her before, were very affectionate all of



<P>a sudden.&nbsp; Several young gentlemen, who had only stared at her

at



<P>the other party, now not only stared, but asked to be introduced,



<P>and said all manner of foolish but agreeable things to her, and



<P>several old ladies, who sat on the sofas, and criticized the rest



<P>of the party, inquired who she was with an air of interest.&nbsp; She



<P>heard Mrs. Moffat reply to one of them...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Daisy March--father a colonel in the army--one of our first



<P>families, but reverses of fortune, you know; intimate friends of



<P>the Laurences; sweet creature, I assure you; my Ned is quite wild



<P>about her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dear me!" said the old lady, putting up her glass for



<P>another observation of Meg, who tried to look as if she had not



<P>heard and been rather shocked at Mrs. Moffat's fibs.



<P>The `queer feeling' did not pass away, but she imagined



<P>herself acting the new part of fine lady and so got on pretty



<P>well, though the tight dress gave her a side-ache, the train kept



<P>getting under her feet, and she was in constant fear lest her



<P>earrings should fly off and get lost or broken.&nbsp; She was flirting



<P>her fan and laughing at the feeble jokes of a young gentleman



<P>who tried to be witty, when she suddenly stopped laughing and



<P>looked confused, for just opposite, she saw Laurie.&nbsp; He was



<P>staring at her with undisguised surprise, and disapproval also,



<P>she thought, for though he bowed and smiled, yet something in



<P>his honest eyes made her blush and wish she had her old dress on.



<P>To complete her confusion, she saw Belle nudge Annie, and both



<P>glance from her to Laurie, who, she was happy to see, looked



<P>unusually boyish and shy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Silly creatures, to put such thoughts into my head.&nbsp; I won't



<P>care for it, or let it change me a bit," thought Meg, and rustled



<P>across the room to shake hands with her friend.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm glad you came, I was afraid you wouldn't." she said,



<P>with her most grown-up air.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Jo wanted me to come, and tell her how you looked, so I



<P>did," answered Laurie, without turning his eyes upon her, though



<P>he half smiled at her maternal tone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What shall you tell her?" asked Meg, full of curiosity to



<P>know his opinion of her, yet feeling ill at ease with him for the



<P>first time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall say I didn't know you, for you look so grown-up and



<P>unlike yourself, I'm quite afraid of you," he said, fumbling at



<P>his glove button.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How absurd of you!&nbsp; The girls dressed me up for fun, and I



<P>rather like it.&nbsp; Wouldn't Jo stare if she saw me?" said Meg, bent



<P>on making him say whether he thought her improved or not.



<P>"Yes, I think she would," returned Laurie gravely.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't you like me so?' asked Meg.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I don't," was the blunt reply.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why not?" in an anxious tone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He glanced at her frizzled head, bare shoulders, and fantastically



<P>trimmed dress with an expression that abashed her more than



<P>his answer, which had not particle of his usual politeness in it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't like fuss and feathers."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That was altogether too much from a lad younger than herself,



<P>and Meg walked away, saying petulantly, "You are the rudest boy I



<P>ever saw."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Feeling very much ruffled, she went and stood at a quiet window



<P>to cool her cheeks, for the tight dress gave her an uncomfortably



<P>brilliant color.&nbsp; As she stood there, Major Lincoln passed by,

and



<P>a minute after she heard him saying to his mother...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They are making a fool of that little girl.&nbsp; I wanted you



<P>to see her, but they have spoiled her entirely.&nbsp; She's nothing



<P>but a doll tonight."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, dear!" sighed Meg.&nbsp; "I wish I'd been sensible and worn



<P>my own things, then I should not have disgusted other people, or



<P>felt so uncomfortable and ashamed of myself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She leaned her forehead on the cool pane, and stood half



<P>hidden by the curtains, never minding that her favorite waltz



<P>had begun, till some one touched her, and turning, she saw



<P>Laurie, looking penitent, as he said, with his very best bow



<P>and his hand out...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Please forgive my rudeness, and come and dance with me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm afraid it will be to disagreeable to you," said Meg,



<P>trying to look offended and failing entirely.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not a bit of it, I'm dying to do it.&nbsp; Come, I'll be good.



<P>I don't like your gown, but I do think you are just splendid."



<P>And he waved his hands, as if words failed to express his



<P>admiration.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg smiled and relented, and whispered as they stood waiting



<P>to catch the time, "Take care my skirt doesn't trip you up.&nbsp; It's



<P>the plague of my life and I was a goose to wear it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Pin it round your neck, and then it will be useful," said



<P>Laurie, looking down at the little blue boots, which he evidently



<P>approved of.



<P>Away they went fleetly and gracefully, for having practiced



<P>at home, they were well matched, and the blithe young couple were



<P>a pleasant sight to see, as they twirled merrily round and round,



<P>feeling more friendly than ever after their small tiff.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Laurie, I want you to do me a favor, will you?' said Meg,



<P>as he stood fanning her when her breath gave out, which it did



<P>very soon though she would not own why.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Won't I!" said Laurie, with alacrity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Please don't tell them at home about my dress tonight.



<P>They won't understand the joke, and it will worry Mother.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then why did you do it?" said Laurie's eyes, so plainly



<P>that Meg hastily added...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall tell them myself all about it, and `fess' to Mother



<P>how silly I've been.&nbsp; But I'd rather do it myself.&nbsp; So you'll

not



<P>tell, will you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I give you my word I won't, only what shall I say when



<P>they ask me?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Just say I looked pretty well and was having a good time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll say the first with all my heart, but how about the



<P>other?&nbsp; You don't look as if you were having a good time.&nbsp;

Are



<P>you?' And Laurie looked at her with an expression which made her



<P>answer in a whisper...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, not just now.&nbsp; Don't think I'm horrid.&nbsp; I only wanted



<P>a little fun, but this sort doesn't pay, I find, and I'm getting



<P>tired of it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here comes Ned Moffat.&nbsp; What does he want?" said Laurie,



<P>knitting his black brows as if he did not regard his young host



<P>in the light of a pleasant addition to the party.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He put his name down for three dances, and I suppose he's



<P>coming for them.&nbsp; What a bore!" said Meg, assuming a languid air



<P>which amused Laurie immensely.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He did not speak to her again till suppertime, when he saw



<P>her drinking champagne with Ned and his friend Fisher, who were



<P>behaving `like a pair of fools', as Laurie said to himself, for



<P>he felt a brotherly sort of right to watch over the Marches and



<P>fight their battles whenever a defender was needed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You'll have a splitting headache tomorrow, if you drink



<P>much of that.&nbsp; I wouldn't, Meg, your mother doesn't like it, you



<P>know," he whispered, leaning over her chair, as Ned turned to



<P>refill her glass and Fisher stooped to pick up her fan.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm not Meg tonight, I'm `a doll' who does all sorts of



<P>crazy things.&nbsp; Tomorrow I shall put away my `fuss and feathers'



<P>and be desperately good again," se answered with an affected



<P>little laugh.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Wish tomorrow was here, then," muttered Laurie, walking off,



<P>ill-pleased at the change he saw in her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg danced and flirted, chattered and giggled, as the other



<P>girls did.&nbsp; After supper she undertook the German, and blundered



<P>through it, nearly upsetting her partner with her long skirt, and



<P>romping in a way that scandalized Laurie, who looked on and meditated



<P>a lecture.&nbsp; But he got no chance to deliver it, for Meg kept away



<P>from him till he came to say good night.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Remember!" she said, trying to smile, for the splitting



<P>headache had already begun.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Silence a` la mort," replied Laurie, with a melodramatic



<P>flourish, as he went away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This little bit of byplay excited Annie's curiosity, but Meg



<P>was too tired for gossip and went to bed, feeling as if she had



<P>been to a masquerade and hadn't enjoyed herself as much as she



<P>expected.&nbsp; She was sick all the next day, and on Saturday went

home,



<P>quite used up with her fortnight's fun and feeling that she had



<P>`sat in the lap of luxury' long enough.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It does seem pleasant to be quiet, and not have company



<P>manners on all the time.&nbsp; Home is a nice place, though it isn't



<P>splendid," said Meg, looking about her with a restful expression,



<P>as she sat with her mother and Jo on the Sunday evening.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm glad to hear you say so, dear, for I was afraid home



<P>would seem dull and poor to you after your fine quarters," replied



<P>her mother, who had given her many anxious looks that day.&nbsp; For



<P>motherly eyes are quick to see any change in children's faces.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg had told her adventures gayly and said over and over what



<P>a charming time she had had, but something still seemed to weigh



<P>upon her spirits, and when the younger girls were gone to bed, she



<P>sat thoughtfully staring at the fire, saying little and looking



<P>worried.&nbsp; As the clock struck nine and Jo proposed bed, Meg



<P>suddenly left her chair and, taking Beth's stool, leaned her elbows



<P>on her mother's knee, saying bravely...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Marmee, I want to `fess'."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I thought so.&nbsp; What is it, dear?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Shall I go away?" asked Jo discreetly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Of course not.&nbsp; Don't I always tell you everything?&nbsp; I was



<P>ashamed to speak of it before the younger children, but I want you



<P>to know all the dreadful things I did at the Moffats'."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We are prepared," said Mrs. March, smiling but looking a



<P>little anxious.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I told you they dressed me up, but I didn't tell you that



<P>they powdered and squeezed and frizzled, and made me look like a



<P>fashion plate.&nbsp; Laurie thought I wasn't proper.&nbsp; I know he

did,



<P>though he didn't say so, and one man called me `a doll'.&nbsp; I knew



<P>it was silly, but they flattered me and said I was a beauty, and



<P>quantities of nonsense, so I let them make a fool of me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Is that all?" asked Jo, as Mrs. March looked silently at



<P>the downcast face of her pretty daughter, and could not find it



<P>in her heart to blame her little follies.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I drank champagne and romped and tried to flirt, and



<P>was altogether abominable," said Meg self-reproachfully.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is something more, I think."&nbsp; And Mrs. March smoothed



<P>the soft cheek, which suddenly grew rosy as Meg answered slowly...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes.&nbsp; It's very silly, but I want to tell it, because I hate



<P>to have people say and think such things about us and Laurie."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then she told the various bits of gossip she had heard at the



<P>Moffats', and as she spoke, Jo saw her mother fold her lips tightly,



<P>as if ill pleased that such ideas should be put into Meg's innocent



<P>mind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, if that isn't the greatest rubbish I ever heard," cried



<P>Jo indignantly.&nbsp; "Why didn't you pop out and tell them so on the



<P>spot?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I couldn't, it was so embarrassing for me.&nbsp; I couldn't help



<P>hearing at first, and then I was so angry and ashamed, I didn't



<P>remember that I ought to go away."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Just wait till I see Annie Moffat, and I'll show you how to



<P>settle such ridiculous stuff.&nbsp; The idea of having `plans' and being



<P>kind to Laurie because he's rich and may marry us by-and-by!&nbsp; Won't



<P>he shout when I tell him what those silly things say about us poor



<P>children?" And Jo laughed, as if on second thoughts the thing



<P>struck her as a good joke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If you tell Laurie, I'll never forgive you!&nbsp; She mustn't,



<P>must she, Mother?" said Meg, looking distressed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, never repeat that foolish gossip, and forget it as soon



<P>as you can," said Mrs. March gravely.&nbsp; "I was very unwise to let



<P>you go among people of whom I know so little, kind, I dare say,



<P>but worldly, ill-bred, and full of these vulgar ideas about young



<P>people.&nbsp; I am more sorry than I can express for the mischief this



<P>visit may have done you, Meg."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't be sorry, I won't let it hurt me.&nbsp; I'll forget all the



<P>bad and remember only the good, for I did enjoy a great deal, and



<P>thank you very much for letting me go.&nbsp; I'll not be sentimental

or



<P>dissatisfied, Mother.&nbsp; I know I'm a silly little girl, and I'll



<P>stay with you till I'm fit to take care of myself.&nbsp; But it is nice



<P>to be praised and admired, and I can't help saying I like it," said



<P>Meg, looking half ashamed of the confession.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That is perfectly natural, and quite harmless, if the liking



<P>does not become a passion and lead one to do foolish or unmaidenly



<P>things.&nbsp; Learn to know and value the praise which is worth having,



<P>and to excite the admiration of excellent people by being modest



<P>as well as pretty, Meg."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Margaret sat thinking a moment, while Jo stood with her hands



<P>behind her, looking both interested and a little perplexed, for it



<P>was a new thing to see Meg blushing and talking about admiration,



<P>lovers, and things of that sort.&nbsp; And Jo felt as if during that



<P>fortnight her sister had grown up amazingly, and was drifting away



<P>from her into a world where she could not follow.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mother, do you have `plans', as Mrs. Moffat said?" asked Meg



<P>bashfully.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, my dear, I have a great many, all mothers do, but mine



<P>differ somewhat from Mrs. Moffat's, I suspect.&nbsp; I will tell you



<P>some of them, for the time has come when a word may set this



<P>romantic little head and heart of yours right, on a very serious



<P>subject.&nbsp; You are young, Meg, but not too young to understand me,



<P>and mothers' lips are the fittest to speak of such things to girls



<P>like you.&nbsp; Jo, your turn will come in time, perhaps, so listen

to



<P>my `plans' and help me carry them out, if they are good."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo went and sat on one arm of the chair, looking as if she



<P>thought they were about to join in some very solemn affair.



<P>Holding a hand of each, and watching the two young faces wistfully,



<P>Mrs. March said, in her serious yet cheery way...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I want my daughters to be beautiful, accomplished, and good.



<P>To be admired, loved, and respected.&nbsp; To have a happy youth, to



<P>be well and wisely married, and to lead useful, pleasant lives,



<P>with as little care and sorrow to try them as God sees fit to send.



<P>To be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing



<P>which can happen to a woman, and I sincerely hope my girls may



<P>know this beautiful experience.&nbsp; It is natural to think of it,

Meg,



<P>right to hope and wait for it, and wise to prepare for it, so that



<P>when the happy time comes, you may feel ready for the duties and



<P>worthy of the joy.&nbsp; My dear girls, I am ambitious for you, but

not



<P>to have you make a dash in the world, marry rich men merely because



<P>they are rich, or have splendid houses, which are not homes because



<P>love is wanting.&nbsp; Money is a needful and precious thing, and when



<P>well used, a noble thing, but I never want you to think it is the



<P>first or only prize to strive for.&nbsp; I'd rather see you poor men's



<P>wives, if you were happy, beloved, contented, than queens on thrones,



<P>without self-respect and peace."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Poor girls don't stand any chance, Belle says, unless they



<P>put themselves forward," sighed Meg.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then we'll be old maids," said Jo stoutly.



<P>"right, Jo.&nbsp; Better be happy old maids than unhappy wives, or



<P>unmaidenly girls, running about to find husbands," said Mrs. March



<P>decidedly.&nbsp; "Don't be troubled, Meg, poverty seldom daunts a sincere



<P>lover.&nbsp; Some of the best and most honored women I know were poor



<P>girls, but so love-worthy that they were not allowed to be old maids.



<P>Leave these things to time.&nbsp; Make this home happy, so that you

may



<P>be fit for homes of your own, if they are offered you, and contented



<P>here if they are not.&nbsp; One thing remember, my girls.&nbsp; Mother

is



<P>always ready to be your confidante, Father to be your friend, and



<P>both of hope and trust that our daughters, whether married or single,



<P>will be the pride and comfort of out lives."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We will, Marmee, we will!" cried both, with all their hearts,



<P>as she bade them good night.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Whatever his motive might have been, Laurie studied to



<P>some purpose that year, for he graduated with honor, and



<P>gave the Latin oration with the grace of a Phillips and the



<P>eloquence of a Demosthenes, so his friends said.&nbsp; They were



<P>all there, his grandfather--oh, so proud--Mr. and Mrs. March,



<P>John and Meg, Jo and Beth, and all exulted over him with the



<P>sincere admiration which boys make light of at the time, but



<P>fail to win from the world by any after-triumphs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I've got to stay for this confounded supper, but I shall



<P>be home early tomorrow.&nbsp; You'll come and meet me as usual,



<P>girls?" Laurie said, as he put the sisters into the carriage



<P>after the joys of the day were over.&nbsp; He said `girls', but he



<P>meant Jo, for she was the only one who kept up the old custom.



<P>She had not the heart to refuse her splendid, successful boy



<P>anything, and answered warmly...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll come, Teddy, rain or shine, and march before you,



<P>playing `Hail the conquering hero comes' on a jew's-harp."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie thanked her with a look that made her think in a



<P>sudden panic, "Oh, deary me!&nbsp; I know he'll say something, and



<P>then what shall I do?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Evening meditation and morning work somewhat allayed her



<P>fears, and having decided that she wouldn't be vain enough



<P>to think people were going to propose when she had given them



<P>every reason to know what her answer would be, she set forth



<P>at the appointed time, hoping Teddy wouldn't do anything to



<P>make her hurt his poor feelings.&nbsp; A call at Meg's, and a



<P>refreshing sniff and sip at the Daisy and Demijohn, still



<P>further fortified her for the tete-a-tete, but when she saw



<P>a stalwart figure looming in the distance, she had a strong



<P>desire to turn about and run away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Where's the jew's-harp, Jo?" cried Laurie, as soon as



<P>he was within speaking distance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I forgot it." And Jo took heart again, for that salutation



<P>could not be called loverlike.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She always used to take his arm on these occasions, now



<P>she did not, and he made no complaint, which was a bad sign,



<P>but talked on rapidly about all sorts of faraway subjects,



<P>till they turned from the road into the little path that led



<P>homeward through the grove.&nbsp; Then he walked more slowly, suddenly



<P>lost his fine flow of language, and now and then a dreadful



<P>pause occurred.&nbsp; To rescue the conversation from one of



<P>the wells of silence into which it kept falling, Jo said



<P>hastily, "Now you must have a good long holiday!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I intend to."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Something in his resolute tone made Jo look up quickly to



<P>find him looking down at her with an expression that assured



<P>her the dreaded moment had come, and made her put out her hand



<P>with an imploring, "No, Teddy.&nbsp; Please don't!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I will, and you must hear me.&nbsp; It's no use, Jo, we've got



<P>to have it out, and the sooner the better for both of us," he



<P>answered, getting flushed and excited all at once.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Say what you like then.&nbsp; I'll listen," said Jo, with a



<P>desperate sort of patience.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie was a young lover, but he was in earnest, and meant



<P>to `have it out', if he died in the attempt, so he plunged into



<P>the subject with characteristic impetuousity, saying in a voice



<P>that would get choky now and then, in spite of manful efforts to



<P>keep it steady .&nbsp; ..



<P>"I've loved you ever since I've known you, Jo, couldn't help



<P>it, you've been so good to me.&nbsp; I've tried to show it, but you



<P>wouldn't let me.&nbsp; Now I'm going to make you hear, and give me an



<P>answer, for I can't go on so any longer."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wanted to save you this.&nbsp; I thought you'd understand...



<P>began Jo, finding it a great deal harder than she expected.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I know you did, but the girls are so queer you never know



<P>what they mean.&nbsp; They say no when they mean yes, and drive a



<P>man out of his wits just for the fun of it," returned Laurie,



<P>entrenching himself behind an undeniable fact.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't.&nbsp; I never wanted to make you care for me so, and



<P>I went away to keep you from it if I could."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I thought so.&nbsp; It was like you, but it was no use.&nbsp; I



<P>only loved you all the more, and I worked hard to please you,



<P>and I gave up billiards and everything you didn't like, and



<P>waited and never complained, for I hoped you'd love me, though



<P>I'm not half good enough..." Here there was a choke that



<P>couldn't be controlled, so he decapitated buttercups while he



<P>cleared his `confounded throat'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You, you are, you're a great deal too good for me, and



<P>I'm so grateful to you, and so proud and fond of you, I don't



<P>know why I can't love you as you want me to.&nbsp; I've tried, but



<P>I can't change the feeling, and it would be a lie to say I do



<P>when I don't."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Really, truly, Jo?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He stopped short, and caught both her hands as he put



<P>his question with a look that she did not soon forget.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Really, truly, dear."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They were in the grove now, close by the stile, and when



<P>the last words fell reluctantly from Jo's lips, Laurie dropped



<P>her hands and turned as if to go on, but for once in his life



<P>the fence was too much for him.&nbsp; So he just laid his head down



<P>on the mossy post, and stood so still that Jo was frightened.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, Teddy, I'm sorry, so desperately sorry, I could kill



<P>myself if it would do any good!&nbsp; I wish you wouldn't take it



<P>so hard, I can't help it.&nbsp; You know it's impossible for people



<P>to make themselves love other people if they don't," cried Jo



<P>inelegantly but remorsefully, as she softly patted his shoulder,



<P>remembering the time when he had comforted her so long ago.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They do sometimes," said a muffled voice from the post.



<P>"I don't believe it's the right sort of love, and I'd



<P>rather not try it," was the decided answer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a long pause, while a blackbird sung blithely on



<P>the willow by the river, and the tall grass rustled in the wind.



<P>Presently Jo said very soberly, as she sat down on the step of



<P>the stile, "Laurie, I want to tell you something."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He started as if he had been shot, threw up his head, and



<P>cried out in a fierce tone, "Don't tell me that, Jo, I can't bear



<P>it now!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Tell what?" she asked, wondering at his violence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That you love that old man."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What old man?" demanded Jo, thinking he must mean his



<P>grandfather.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That devilish Professor you were always writing about.



<P>If you say you love him, I know I shall do something desperate."



<P>And he looked as if he would keep his word, as he clenched



<P>his hands with a wrathful spark in his eyes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo wanted to laugh, but restrained herself and said warmly,



<P>for she too, was getting excited with all this, "Don't swear,



<P>Teddy!&nbsp; He isn't old, nor anything bad, but good and kind, and



<P>the best friend I've got, next to you.&nbsp; Pray, don't fly into



<P>a passion.&nbsp; I want to be kind, but I know I shall get angry if



<P>you abuse my Professor.&nbsp; I haven't the least idea of loving



<P>him or anybody else."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But you will after a while, and then what will become of me?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You'll love someone else too, like a sensible boy, and



<P>forget all this trouble."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I can't love anyone else, and I'll never forget you, Jo,



<P>Never! Never!" with a stamp to emphasize his passionate words.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What shall I do with him?" sighed Jo, finding that emotions



<P>were more unmanagable than she expected.&nbsp; "You haven't heard



<P>what I wanted to tell you.&nbsp; Sit down and listen, for indeed I



<P>want to do right and make you happy," she said, hoping to soothe



<P>him with a little reason, which proved that she knew nothing



<P>about love.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Seeing a ray of hope in that last speech, Laurie threw himself



<P>down on the grass at her feet, leaned his arm on the lower



<P>step of the stile, and looked up at her with an expectant face.



<P>Now that arrangement was not conducive to calm speech or clear



<P>thought on Jo's part, for how could she say hard things to her



<P>boy while he watched her with eyes full of love and longing,



<P>and lashes still wet with the bitter drop or two her hardness



<P>of heart had wrung from him?&nbsp; She gently turned his head away,



<P>saying, as she stroked the wavy hair which had been allowed to



<P>grow for her sake--how touching that was, to be sure!



<P>"I agree with Mother that you and I are not suited to each



<P>other, because our quick tempers and strong wills would probably



<P>make us very miserable, if we were so foolish as to..."



<P>Jo paused a little over the last word, but Laurie uttered it



<P>with a rapturous expression.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Marry--no we shouldn't!&nbsp; If you loved me, Jo, I should



<P>be a perfect saint, for you could make me anything you like."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I can't.&nbsp; I've tried and failed, and I won't risk



<P>our happiness by such a serious experiment.&nbsp; We don't agree and



<P>we never shall, so we'll be good friends all our lives, but we



<P>won't go and do anything rash."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, we will if we get the chance," muttered Laurie rebelliously.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now do be reasonable, and take a sensible view of the case,"



<P>implored Jo, almost at her wit's end.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I won't be reasonable.&nbsp; I don't want to take what you



<P>call `a sensible view'.&nbsp; It won't help me, and it only makes



<P>it harder.&nbsp; I don't believe you've got any heart."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wish I hadn't."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a little quiver in Jo's voice, and thinking it a



<P>good omen, Laurie turned round, bringing all his persuasive



<P>powers to bear as he said, in the wheedlesome tone that had



<P>never been so dangerously wheedlesome before, "Don't disappoint



<P>us, dear!&nbsp; Everyone expects it.&nbsp; Grandpa has set his heart

upon



<P>it, your people like it, and I can't get on without you.&nbsp; Say



<P>you will, and let's be happy.&nbsp; Do, do!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Not until months afterward did Jo understand how she had



<P>the strength of mind to hold fast to the resolution she had



<P>made when she decided that she did not love her boy, and



<P>never could.&nbsp; It was very hard to do, but she did it, knowing



<P>that delay was both useless and cruel.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I can't say `yes' truly, so I won't say it at all.&nbsp; You'll



<P>see that I'm right, by-and-by, and thank me for it..." she



<P>began solemnly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll be hanged if I do!"&nbsp; And Laurie bounced up off the



<P>grass, burning with indignation at the very idea.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, you will!" persisted Jo.&nbsp; "You'll get over this after



<P>a while, and find some lovely accomplished girl, who will adore



<P>you, and make a fine mistress for your fine house.&nbsp; I shouldn't.



<P>I'm homely and awkward and odd and old, and you'd be ashamed



<P>of me, and we should quarrel--we can't help it even now, you see-and



<P>I shouldn't like elegant society and you would, and you'd



<P>hate my scribbling, and I couldn't get on without it, and we



<P>should be unhappy, and wish we hadn't done it, and everything



<P>would be horrid!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Anything more?" asked asked Laurie, finding it hard to



<P>listen patiently to this prophetic burst.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nothing more, except that I don't believe I shall ever



<P>marry.&nbsp; I'm happy as I am, and love my liberty too well to



<P>be in a hurry to give it up for any mortal man."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I know better!" broke in Laurie.&nbsp; "You think so now,



<P>but there'll come a time when you will care for somebody, and



<P>you'll love him tremendously, and live and die for him.&nbsp; I



<P>know you will, it's your way, and I shall have to stand by



<P>and see it."&nbsp; And the despairing lover cast his hat upon the



<P>ground with a gesture that would have seemed comical, if his



<P>face had not been so tragic.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, I will live and die for him, if her ever comes and



<P>makes me love him in spite of myself, and you must do the best



<P>you can!" cried Jo, losing patience with poor Teddy.&nbsp; "I've



<P>done my best, but you won't be reasonable, and it's selfish



<P>of you to keep teasing for what I can't give.&nbsp; I shall always



<P>be fond of you, very fond indeed, as a friend, but I'll never



<P>marry you, and the sooner you believe it the better for both



<P>of us--so now!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That speech was like gunpowder.&nbsp; Laurie looked at her a



<P>minute as if he did not quite know what to do with himself,



<P>then turned sharply away, saying in a desperate sort of tone,



<P>"You'll be sorry some day, Jo."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, where are you going?" she cried, for his face frightened her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To the devil!" was the consoling answer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For a minute Jo's heart stood still, as he swung himself



<P>down the bank toward the river, but it takes much folly, sin



<P>or misery to send a young man to a violent death, and Laurie



<P>was not one of the weak sort who are conquered by a single



<P>failure.&nbsp; He had no thought of a melodramatic plunge, but



<P>some blind instinct led him to fling hat and coat into his boat,



<P>and row away with all his might, making better time up the



<P>river than he had done in any race.&nbsp; Jo drew a long breath and



<P>unclasped her hands as she watched the poor fellow trying to



<P>outstrip the trouble which he carried in his heart.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That will do him good, and he'll come home in such a



<P>tender, penitent state of mind, that I shan't dare to see him."



<P>she said, adding, as she went slowly home, feeling as if she



<P>had murdered some innocent thing, and buried it under the



<P>leaves.&nbsp; "Now I must go and prepare Mr. Laurence to be very



<P>kind to my poor boy.&nbsp; I wish he'd love Beth, perhaps he may



<P>in time, but I begin to think I was mistaken about her.&nbsp; Oh



<P>dear!&nbsp; How can girls like to have lovers and refuse them?&nbsp;

I



<P>think it's dreadful."



<P>Being sure that no one could do it so well as herself, she



<P>went straight to Mr. Laurence, told the hard story bravely



<P>through, and then broke down, crying so dismally over her own



<P>insensibility that the kind old gentleman, though sorely disappointed,



<P>did not utter a reproach.&nbsp; He found it difficult to understand



<P>how any girl could help loving Laurie, and hoped she would



<P>change her mind, but he knew even better than Jo that love



<P>cannot be forced, so he shook his head sadly and resolved



<P>to carry his boy out of harm's way, for Young Impetuosity's



<P>parting words to Jo disturbed him more than he would confess.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Laurie came home, dead tired but quite composed, his



<P>grandfather met him as if he knew nothing, and kept up the



<P>delusion very successfully for an hour or two.&nbsp; But when they



<P>sat together in the twilight, the time they used to enjoy so



<P>much, it was hard work for the old man to ramble on as usual,



<P>and harder still for the young one to listen to praises of



<P>the last year's success, which to him now seemed like love's



<P>labor lost.&nbsp; He bore it as long as he could, then went to



<P>his piano and began to play.&nbsp; The window's were open, and Jo,



<P>walking in the garden with Beth, for once understood music



<P>better than her sister, for he played the `SONATA PATHETIQUE',



<P>and played it as he never did before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's very fine, I dare say, but it's sad enough to make



<P>one cry.&nbsp; Give us something gayer, lad," said Mr. Laurence,



<P>whose kind old heart was full of sympathy, which he longed to



<P>show but knew not how.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie dashed into a livelier strain, played stormily for



<P>several minutes, and would have got through bravely, if in a



<P>momentary lull Mrs. March's voice had not been heard calling,



<P>"Jo, dear, come in.&nbsp; I want you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Just what Laurie longed to say, with a different meaning!



<P>As he listened, he lost his place, the music ended with a broken



<P>chord, and the musician sat silent in the dark.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I can't stand this," muttered the old gentleman.&nbsp; Up he



<P>got, groped his way to the piano, laid a kind hand on either



<P>of the broad shoulders, and said, as gently as a woman, "I



<P>know, my boy, I know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>No answer for an instant, then Laurie asked sharply, "Who



<P>told you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Jo herself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then there's an end of it!"&nbsp; And he shook off his grandfather's



<P>hands with an impatient motion, for though grateful



<P>for the sympathy, his man's pride could not bear a man's pity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not quite.&nbsp; I want to say one thing, and then there shall



<P>be an end of it," returned Mr. Laurence with unusual mildness.



<P>"You won't care to stay at home now, perhaps?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't intend to run away from a girl.&nbsp; Jo can't prevent



<P>my seeing her, and I shall stay and do it as long as I like,"



<P>interrupted Laurie in a defiant tone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not if you are the gentleman I think you.&nbsp; I'm disappointed,



<P>but the girl can't help it, and the only thing left



<P>for you to do is to go away for a time.&nbsp; Where will you go?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Anywhere.&nbsp; I don't care what becomes of me."&nbsp; And Laurie



<P>got up with a reckless laugh that grated on his grandfather's



<P>ear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Take it like a man, and don't do anything rash, for God's



<P>sake.&nbsp; Why not go abroad, as you planned, and forget it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I can't."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But you've been wild to go, and I promised you should



<P>when you got through college."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, but I didn't mean to go alone!"&nbsp; And Laurie walked



<P>fast through the room with an expression which it was well



<P>his grandfather did not see.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't ask you to go alone.&nbsp; There's someone ready and



<P>glad to go with you, anywhere in the world."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Who, Sir?' stopping to listen.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Myself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie came back as quickly as he went, and put out his



<P>hand, saying huskily, "I'm a selfish brute, but--you know-Grandfather--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Lord help me, yes, I do know, for I've been through it all



<P>before, once in my own young days, and then with your father.



<P>Now, my dear boy, just sit quietly down and hear my plan.&nbsp; It's



<P>all settled, and can be carried out at once," said Mr. Laurence,



<P>keeping hold of the young man, as if fearful that he would break



<P>away as his father had done before him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, sir, what is it?" And Laurie sat down, without a



<P>sign of interest in face or voice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is business in London that needs looking after.&nbsp; I



<P>meant you should attend to it, but I can do it better myself,



<P>and things here will get on very well with Brooke to manage



<P>them.&nbsp; My partners do almost everything, I'm merely holding



<P>on until you take my place, and can be off at any time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But you hate traveling, Sir.&nbsp; I can't ask it of you at



<P>your age," began Laurie, who was grateful for the sacrifice,



<P>but much preferred to go alone, if he went at all.



<P>The old gentleman knew that perfectly well, and particularly



<P>desired to prevent it, for the mood in which he found his



<P>grandson assured him that it would not be wise to leave him to



<P>his own devices.&nbsp; So, stifling a natural regret at the thought



<P>of the home comforts he would leave behind him, he said stoutly,



<P>Bless your soul, I'm not superannuated yet.&nbsp; I quite enjoy the



<P>idea.&nbsp; It will do me good, and my old bones won't suffer, for



<P>traveling nowadays is almost as easy as sitting in a chair."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A restless movement from Laurie suggested that his chair



<P>was not easy, or that he did not like the plan, and made the



<P>old man add hastily, "I don't mean to be a marplot or a burden.



<P>I go because I think you'd feel happier than if I was



<P>left behind.&nbsp; I don't intend to gad about with you, but leave



<P>you free to go where you like, while I amuse myself in my own



<P>way.&nbsp; I've friends in London and Paris, and should like to



<P>visit them.&nbsp; Meantime you can go to Italy, Germany, Switzerland,



<P>where you will, and enjoy pictures, music, scenery,



<P>and adventures to your heart's content."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, Laurie felt just then that his heart was entirely



<P>broken and the world a howling wilderness, but at the sound



<P>of certain words which the old gentleman artfully introduced



<P>into his closing sentence, the broken heart gave an unexpected



<P>leap, and a green oasis or two suddenly appeared in the howling



<P>wilderness.&nbsp; He sighed, and then said, in a spiritless tone,



<P>"Just as you like, Sir.&nbsp; It doesn't matter where I go or what I

do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It does to me, remember that, my lad.&nbsp; I give you entire



<P>liberty, but I trust you to make an honest use of it.&nbsp; Promise



<P>me that, Laurie."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Anything you like, Sir."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Good," thought the old gentleman.&nbsp; "You don't care now,



<P>but there'll come a time when that promise will keep you out



<P>of mischief, or I'm much mistaken."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Being an energetic individual, Mr. Laurence struck while



<P>the iron was hot, and before the blighted being recovered spirit



<P>enough to rebel, they were off.&nbsp; During the time necessary for



<P>preparation, Laurie bore himself as young gentleman usually do



<P>in such cases.&nbsp; He was moody, irritable, and pensive by turns,



<P>lost his appetite, neglected his dress and devoted much time



<P>to playing tempestuously on his piano, avoided Jo, but consoled



<P>himself by staring at her from his window, with a tragic



<P>face that haunted her dreams by night and oppressed her with a



<P>heavy sense of guilt by day.&nbsp; Unlike some sufferers, he never



<P>spoke of his unrequited passion, and would allow no one, not



<P>even Mrs. March, to attempt consolation or offer sympathy.&nbsp; On



<P>some accounts, this was a relief to his friends, but the weeks



<P>before his departure were very uncomfortable, and everyone rejoiced



<P>that the `poor, dear fellow was going away to forget his



<P>trouble, and come home happy'.&nbsp; Of course, he smiled darkly at



<P>their delusion, but passed it by with the sad superiority of



<P>one who knew that his fidelity like his love was unalterable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the parting came he affected high spirits, to conceal



<P>certain inconvenient emotions which seemed inclined to assert



<P>themselves.&nbsp; This gaiety did not impose upon anybody, but they



<P>tried to look as if it did for his sake, and he got on very well



<P>till Mrs. March kissed him, whit a whisper full of motherly



<P>solicitude.&nbsp; Then feeling that he was going very fast, he hastily



<P>embraced them all round, not forgetting the afflicted Hannah, and



<P>ran downstairs as if for his life.&nbsp; Jo followed a minute after

to



<P>wave her hand to him if he looked round.&nbsp; He did look round, came



<P>back, put his arms about her as she stood on the step above him,



<P>and looked up at her with a face that made his short appeal eloquent



<P>and pathetic.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, Jo, can't you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Teddy, dear, I wish I could!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That was all, except a little pause.&nbsp; Then Laurie straightened



<P>himself up, said, "It's all right, never mind," and went away without



<P>another word.&nbsp; Ah, but it wasn't all right, and Jo did mind, for



<P>while the curly head lay on her arm a minute after her hard answer,



<P>she felt as if she had stabbed her dearest friend, and when he left



<P>her without a look behind him, she knew that the boy Laurie never



<P>would come again.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo's face was a study next day, for the secret rather weighed



<P>upon her, and she found it hard not to look mysterious and



<P>important.&nbsp; Meg observed it, but did not trouble herself to make



<P>inquiries, for she had learned that the best way to manage Jo was



<P>by the law of contraries, so she felt sure of being told everything



<P>if she did not ask.&nbsp; She was rather surprised, therefore,



<P>when the silence remained unbroken, and Jo assumed a patronizing



<P>air, which decidedly aggravated Meg, who in turn assumed an air



<P>of dignified reserve and devoted herself to her mother.&nbsp; This left



<P>Jo to her own devices, for Mrs. March had taken her place as nurse,



<P>and bade her rest, exercise, and amuse herself after her long



<P>confinement.&nbsp; Amy being gone, Laurie was her only refuge, and much



<P>as she enjoyed his society, she rather dreaded him just then, for



<P>he was an incorrigible tease, and she feared he would coax the



<P>secret from her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was quite right, for the mischief-loving lad no sooner



<P>suspected a mystery than he set himself to find it out, and led



<P>Jo a trying life of it.&nbsp; He wheedled, bribed, ridiculed,



<P>threatened, and scolded; affected indifference, that he might surprise



<P>the truth from her; declared her knew, then that he didn't care;



<P>and at last, by dint of perseverance, he satisfied himself that



<P>it concerned Meg and Mr. Brooke.&nbsp; Feeling indignant that he was



<P>not taken into his tutor's confidence, he set his wits to work



<P>to devise some proper retaliation for the slight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg meanwhile had apparently forgotten the matter and was



<P>absorbed in preparations for her father's return, but all of a



<P>sudden a change seemed to come over her, and, for a day or two,



<P>she was quite unlike herself.&nbsp; She started when spoken to,



<P>blushed when looked at, was very quiet, and sat over her sewing,



<P>with a timid, troubled look on her face.&nbsp; To her mother's inquiries



<P>she answered that she was quite well, and Jo's she silenced by



<P>begging to be let alone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She feels it in the air--love, I mean--and she's going very



<P>fast.&nbsp; She's got most of the symptoms--is twittery and cross,



<P>doesn't eat, lies awake, and mopes in corners.&nbsp; I caught her



<P>singing that song he gave her, and once she said `John', as you



<P>do, and then turned as red as a poppy.&nbsp; whatever shall we do?"



<P>said Jo, looking ready for any measures, however violent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nothing but wait.&nbsp; Let her alone, be kind and patient, and



<P>Father's coming will settle everything," replied her mother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here's a note to you, Meg, all sealed up.&nbsp; How odd! Teddy



<P>never seals mine," said Jo next day, as she distributed the



<P>contents of the little post office.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. March and Jo were deep in their own affairs, when a



<P>sound from Meg made them look up to see her staring at her



<P>note with a frightened face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My child, what is it?" cried her mother, running to her,



<P>while Jo tried to take the paper which had done the mischief.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's all a mistake, he didn't send it.&nbsp; Oh, Jo, how could



<P>you do it?" and Meg hid her face in her hands, crying as if her



<P>heart were quite broken.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Me!&nbsp; I've done nothing!&nbsp; What's she talking about?" cried



<P>Jo, bewildered.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg's mild eyes kindled with anger as she pulled a crumpled



<P>note from her pocket and threw it at Jo, saying reproachfully,



<P>"You wrote it, and that bad boy helped you.&nbsp; How could you be



<P>so rude, so mean, and cruel to us both?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo hardly heard her, for she and her mother were reading the



<P>note, which was written in a peculiar hand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My Dearest Margaret,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I can no longer restrain my passion, and must know my fate



<P>before I return.&nbsp; I dare not tell your parents yet, but I think



<P>they would consent if they knew that we adored one another.&nbsp; Mr.



<P>Laurence will help me to some good place, and then, my sweet



<P>girl, you will make me happy.&nbsp; I implore you to say nothing to



<P>your family yet, but to send one word of hope through Laurie to,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your devoted John."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, the little villain!&nbsp; That's the way he meant to pay me



<P>for keeping my word to Mother.&nbsp; I'll give him a hearty scolding



<P>and bring him over to beg pardon," cried Jo, burning to execute



<P>immediate justice.&nbsp; But her mother held her back, saying, with



<P>a look she seldom wore...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Stop, Jo, you must clear yourself first.&nbsp; You have played



<P>so many pranks that I am afraid you have had a hand in this."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"On my word, Mother, I haven't!&nbsp; I never saw that note



<P>before, and don't know anything about it, as true as I live!"



<P>said Jo, so earnestly that they believed her.&nbsp; "If I had taken



<P>part in it I'd have done it better than this, and have written



<P>a sensible note.&nbsp; I should think you'd have known Mr. Brooke



<P>wouldn't write such stuff as that," she added, scornfully



<P>tossing down the paper.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's like his writing," faltered Meg, comparing it with the



<P>note in her hand.



<P>"Oh, Meg, you didn't answer it?" cried Mrs. March quickly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, I did!" and Meg hid her face again, overcome with shame.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here's a scrape!&nbsp; Do let me bring that wicked boy over to



<P>explain and be lectured.&nbsp; I can't rest till I get hold of him."



<P>And Jo made for the door again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hush!&nbsp; Let me handle this, for it is worse than I thought.



<P>Margaret, tell me the whole story," commanded Mrs. March, sitting



<P>down by Meg, yet keeping hold of Jo, lest she should fly off.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I received the first letter from Laurie, who didn't look



<P>as if he knew anything about it," began Meg, without looking up.



<P>"I was worried at first and meant to tell you, then I remembered



<P>how you liked Mr. Brooke, so I thought you wouldn't mind if I



<P>kept my little secret for a few days.&nbsp; I'm so silly that I liked



<P>to think no one knew, and while I was deciding what to say, I



<P>felt like the girls in books, who have such things to do.&nbsp; Forgive



<P>me, Mother, I'm paid for my silliness now.&nbsp; I never can look him



<P>in the face again."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What did you say to him?' asked Mrs. March.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I only said I was too young to do anything about it yet,



<P>that I didn't wish to have secrets from you, and he must speak



<P>to father.&nbsp; I was very grateful for his kindness, and would be



<P>his friend, but nothing more, for a long while."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. March smiled, as if well pleased, and Jo clapped her



<P>hands, exclaiming, with a laugh, "You are almost equal to



<P>Caroline Percy, who was a pattern of prudence!&nbsp; Tell on, Meg.



<P>What did he say to that?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He writes in a different way entirely, telling me that he



<P>never sent any love letter at all, and is very sorry that my



<P>roguish sister, Jo, should take liberties with our names.&nbsp; It's



<P>very kind and respectful, but think how dreadful for me!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg leaned against her mother, looking the image of despair,



<P>and Jo tramped about the room, calling Laurie names.&nbsp; All of a



<P>sudden she stopped, caught up the two notes, and after looking



<P>at them closely, said decidedly, "I don't believe Brooke ever



<P>saw either of these letters.&nbsp; Teddy wrote both, and keeps yours



<P>to crow over me with because I wouldn't tell him my secret."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't have any secrets, Jo.&nbsp; Tell it to Mother and keep



<P>out of trouble, as I should have done," said Meg warningly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Bless you, child!&nbsp; Mother told me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That will do, Jo.&nbsp; I'll comfort Meg while you go and get



<P>Laurie.&nbsp; I shall sift the matter to the bottom, and put a stop



<P>to such pranks at once."



<P>Away ran Jo, and Mrs. March gently told Meg Mr. Brooke's



<P>real feelings.&nbsp; "Now, dear, what are your own?&nbsp; Do you love

him



<P>enough to wait till her can make a home for you, or will you



<P>keep yourself quite free for the present?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I've been so scared and worried, I don't want to have



<P>anything to do with lovers for a long while, perhaps never,"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>answered Meg petulantly.&nbsp; "If John doesn't know anything about



<P>this nonsense, don't tell him, and make Jo and Laurie hold their



<P>tongues.&nbsp; I won't be deceived and plagued and made a fool of.



<P>It's a shame!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Seeing Meg's usually gentle temper was roused and her



<P>pride hurt by this mischievous joke, Mrs. March soothed her



<P>by promises of entire silence and great discretion for the



<P>future.&nbsp; The instant Laurie's step was heard in the hall, Meg



<P>fled into the study, and Mrs. March received the culprit alone.



<P>Jo had not told him why he was wanted, fearing he wouldn't come,



<P>but he knew the minute he saw Mrs. March's face, and stood



<P>twirling his hat with a guilty air which convicted him at once.



<P>Jo was dismissed, but chose to march up and down the hall like



<P>a sentinel, having some fear that the prisoner might bolt.&nbsp; The



<P>sound of voices in the parlor rose and fell for half an hour,



<P>but what happened during that interview the girls never knew.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When they were called in, Laurie was standing by their



<P>mother with such a penitent face that Jo forgave him on the



<P>spot, but did not think it wise to betray the fact.&nbsp; Meg received



<P>his humble apology, and was much comforted by the assurance that



<P>Brooke knew nothing of the joke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll never tell him to my dying day, wild horses shan't



<P>drag it out of me, so you'll forgive me, Meg, and I'll do



<P>anything to show how out-and-out sorry I am," he added,



<P>looking very much ashamed of himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll try, but it was a very ungentlemanly thing to do, I



<P>didn't think you could be so sly and malicious, Laurie," replied



<P>Meg, trying to hid her maidenly confusion under a gravely



<P>reproachful air.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It was altogether abominable, and I don't deserve to be



<P>spoken to for a month, but you will, though, won't you?" And



<P>Laurie folded his hands together with such and imploring gesture,



<P>as he spoke in his irresistibly persuasive tone, that it was



<P>impossible to frown upon him in spite of his scandalous behavior.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg pardoned him, and Mrs. March's grave face relaxed, in



<P>spite of her efforts to keep sober, when she heard him declare



<P>that he would atone for his sins by all sorts of penances, and



<P>abase himself like a worm before the injured damsel.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo stood aloof, meanwhile, trying to harden her heart



<P>against him, and succeeding only in primming up her face into



<P>an expression of entire disapprobation.&nbsp; Laurie looked at her



<P>once or twice, but as she showed no sign of relenting, he felt



<P>injured, and turned his back on her till the others were done



<P>with him, when he made her a low bow and walked off without a



<P>word.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As soon as he had gone, she wished she had been more forgiving,



<P>and when Meg and her mother went upstairs, she felt



<P>lonely and longed for Teddy.&nbsp; After resisting for some time,



<P>she yielded to the impulse, and armed with a book to return,



<P>went over to the big house.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Is Mr. Laurence in?" asked Jo, of a housemaid, who was



<P>coming downstairs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, Miss, but I don't believe he's seeable just yet."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why not?&nbsp; Is he ill?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"La, no Miss, but he's had a scene with Mr. Laurie, who is



<P>in one of his tantrums about something, which vexes the old



<P>gentleman, so I dursn't go nigh him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Where is Laurie?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Shut up in his room, and he won't answer, though I've been



<P>a-tapping.&nbsp; I don't know what's to become of the dinner, for it's



<P>ready, and there's no one to eat it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll go and see what the matter is.&nbsp; I'm not afraid of either



<P>of them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Up went Jo, and knocked smartly on the door of Laurie's



<P>little study.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Stop that, or I'll open the door and make you!" called out



<P>the young gentleman in a threatening tone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo immediately knocked again.&nbsp; The door flew open, and in



<P>she bounced before Laurie could recover from his surprise.&nbsp; Seeing



<P>that he really was out of temper, Jo, who knew how to manage him,



<P>assumed a contrite expression, and going artistically down upon



<P>her knees, said meekly, "Please forgive me for being so cross.&nbsp;

I



<P>came to make it up, and can't go away till I have."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's all right.&nbsp; Get up, and don't be a goose, Jo," was the



<P>cavalier reply to her petition.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you, I will.&nbsp; Could I ask what's the matter?&nbsp; You don't



<P>look exactly easy in your mind."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I've been shaken, and I won't bear it!" growled Laurie indignantly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Who did it?" demanded Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Grandfather.&nbsp; If it had been anyone else I'd have..."



<P>And the injured youth finished his sentence by an energetic



<P>gesture of the right arm.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's nothing.&nbsp; I often shake you, and you don't mind,"



<P>said Jo soothingly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Pooh!&nbsp; You're a girl, and it's fun, but I'll allow no man



<P>to shake me!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't think anyone would care to try it, if you looked



<P>as much like a thundercloud as you do now.&nbsp; Why were you treated



<P>so?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Just because I wouldn't say what your mother wanted me for.



<P>I'd promised not to tell, and of course I wasn't going to break



<P>my word."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Couldn't you satisfy your grandpa in any other way?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, he would have the truth, the whole truth, and nothing



<P>but the truth.&nbsp; I'd have told my part of the scrape, if I could



<P>without bringing Meg in.&nbsp; As I couldn't, I held my tongue, and



<P>bore the scolding till the old gentleman collared me.&nbsp; Then I



<P>bolted, for fear I should forget myself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It wasn't nice, but he's sorry, I know, so go down and



<P>make up.&nbsp; I'll help you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hanged if I do!&nbsp; I'm not going to be lectured and pummelled



<P>by everyone, just for a bit of a frolic.&nbsp; I was sorry about Meg,



<P>and begged pardon like a man, but I won't do it again,



<P>when I wasn't in the wrong."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He didn't know that."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He ought to trust me, and not act as if I was a baby.&nbsp; It's



<P>no use, Jo, he's got to learn that I'm able to take care of



<P>myself, and don't need anyone's apron string to hold on by."



<P>"What pepper pots you are! " sighed Jo.&nbsp; "How do you mean



<P>to settle this affair?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, he ought to beg pardon, and believe me when I say I



<P>can't tell him what the fuss's about."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Bless you!&nbsp; He won't do that."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I won't go down till he does."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now, Teddy, be sensible.&nbsp; Let it pass, and I'll explain



<P>what I can.&nbsp; You can't stay here, so what's the use of being



<P>melodramatic?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't intend to stay here long, anyway.&nbsp; I'll slip off and



<P>take a journey somewhere, and when Grandpa misses me he'll come



<P>round fast enough."



<P>"I dare say, but you ought not to go and worry him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't preach.&nbsp; I'll go to Washington and see Brooke.&nbsp; It's



<P>gay there, and I'll enjoy myself after the troubles."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What fun you'd have!&nbsp; I wish I could run off too," said



<P>Jo, forgetting her part of mentor in lively visions of martial



<P>life at the capital.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Come on, then!&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; You go and surprise your father,



<P>and I'll stir up old Brooke.&nbsp; It would be a glorious joke.&nbsp;

Let's



<P>do it, Jo.&nbsp; We'll leave a letter saying we are all right, and trot



<P>off at once.&nbsp; I've got money enough.&nbsp; It will do you good,

and no



<P>harm, as you go to your father."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For a moment Jo looked as if she would agree, for wild as



<P>the plan was, it just suited her.&nbsp; She was tired of care and



<P>confinement, longed for change, and thoughts of her father



<P>blended temptingly with the novel charms of camps and hospitals,



<P>liberty and fun.&nbsp; Her eyes kindled as they turned wistfully



<P>toward the window, but they fell on the old house opposite,



<P>and she shook her head with sorrowful decision.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If I was a boy, we'd run away together, and have a capital time,



<P>but as I'm a miserable girl, I must be proper and stop at home.



<P>Don't tempt me, Teddy, it's a crazy plan."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's the fun of it," began Laurie, who had got a willful



<P>fit on him and was possessed to break out of bounds in some way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hold your tongue!" cried Jo, covering her ears.&nbsp; "`Prunes



<P>and prisms' are my doom, and I may as well make up my mind to



<P>it.&nbsp; I came here to moralize, not to hear things that make me



<P>skip to think of."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I know Meg would wet-blanket such a proposal, but I



<P>thought you had more spirit," began Laurie insinuatingly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Bad boy, be quiet!&nbsp; Sit down and think of your own sins,



<P>don't go making me add to mine.&nbsp; If I get your grandpa to



<P>apologize for the shaking, will you give up running away?"



<P>asked Jo seriously.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, but you won't do it," answered Laurie, who wished



<P>to make up, but felt that his outraged dignity must be



<P>appeased first.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If I can manage the young one, I can the old one," muttered Jo,



<P>as she walked away, leaving Laurie bent over a railroad map



<P>with his head propped up on both hands.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Come in!"&nbsp; And Mr. Laurence's gruff voice sounded gruffer



<P>than ever, as Jo tapped at his door.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's only me, Sir, come to return a book," she said blandly,



<P>as she entered.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Want any more?" asked the old gentleman, looking grim and



<P>vexed, but trying not to show it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, please.&nbsp; I like old Sam so well, I think I'll try the



<P>second volume," returned Jo, hoping to propitiate him by



<P>accepting a second dose of Boswell's Johnson, as he had recommended



<P>that lively work.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The shaggy eyebrows unbent a little as he rolled the steps



<P>toward the shelf where the Johnsonian literature was placed.&nbsp; Jo



<P>skipped up, and sitting on the top step, affected to be searching



<P>for her book, but was really wondering how best to introduce the



<P>dangerous object of her visit.&nbsp; Mr. Laurence seemed to suspect



<P>that something was brewing in her mind, for after taking several



<P>brisk turns about the room, he faced round on her, speaking so



<P>abruptly that Rasselas tumbled face downward on the floor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What has that boy been about?&nbsp; Don't try to shield him.&nbsp;

I



<P>know he has been in mischief by the way he acted when he came



<P>home.&nbsp; I can't get a word from him, and when I threatened to



<P>shake the truth out of him he bolted upstairs and locked himself



<P>into his room."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He did wrong, but we forgave him, and all promised not to



<P>say a word to anyone," began Jo reluctantly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That won't do.&nbsp; He shall not shelter himself behind a promise



<P>from you softhearted girls.&nbsp; If he's done anything amiss, he



<P>shall confess, beg pardon, and be punished.&nbsp; Out with it, Jo.



<P>I won't be kept in the dark."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Laurence looked so alarming and spoke so sharply that Jo



<P>would have gladly run away, if she could, but she was perched aloft



<P>on the steps, and he stood at the foot, a lion in the path, so she



<P>had to stay and brave it out.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed, Sir, I cannot tell.&nbsp; Mother forbade it.&nbsp; Laurie has



<P>confessed, asked pardon, and been punished quite enough.&nbsp; We don't



<P>keep silence to shield him, but someone else, and it will make



<P>more trouble if you interfere.&nbsp; Please don't.&nbsp; It was partly

my



<P>fault, but it's all right now.&nbsp; So let's forget it, and talk about



<P>the RAMBLER or something pleasant."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hang the RAMBLER!&nbsp; Come down and give me your word that



<P>this harum-scarum boy of mine hasn't done anything ungrateful or



<P>impertinent.&nbsp; If he has, after all your kindness to him, I'll



<P>thrash him with my own hands."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The threat sounded awful, but did not alarm Jo, for she knew



<P>the irascible old gentleman would never lift a finger against his



<P>grandson, whatever he might say to the contrary.&nbsp; She obediently



<P>descended, and made as light of the prank as she could without



<P>betraying Meg or forgetting the truth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hum...&nbsp; ha...&nbsp; well, if the boy held his tongue



<P>because he promised, and not from obstinacy, I'll forgive him.



<P>He's a stubborn fellow and hard to manage," said Mr. Laurence,



<P>rubbing up his hair till it looked as if he had been out in a gale,



<P>and smoothing the frown from his brow with an air of relief.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So am I, but a kind word will govern me when all the king's



<P>horses and all the king's men couldn't," said Jo, trying to say



<P>a kind word for her friend, who seemed to get out of one scrape



<P>only to fall into another.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You think I'm not kind to him, hey?" was the sharp answer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, dear no, Sir.&nbsp; You are rather too kind sometimes, and



<P>then just a trifle hasty when he tries your patience.&nbsp; Don't you



<P>think you are?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo was determined to have it out now, and tried to look



<P>quite placid, though she quaked a little after her bold speech.



<P>To her great relief and surprise, the old gentleman only threw



<P>his spectacles onto the table with a rattle and exclaimed frankly,



<P>"You're right, girl, I am!&nbsp; I love the boy, but he tries my



<P>patience past bearing, and I know how it will end, if we go on so."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll tell you, he'll run away." Jo was sorry for that speech the minute



<P>it was made.&nbsp; She meant to warn him that Laurie would not bear

much restraint,



<P>and hoped he would be more forebearing with the lad.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Laurence's ruddy face changed suddenly, and he sat down,



<P>with a troubled glance at the picture of a handsome man, which



<P>hung over his table.&nbsp; It was Laurie's father, who had run away



<P>in his youth, and married against the imperious old man's will.



<P>Jo fancied her remembered and regretted the past, and she wished



<P>she had held her tongue.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He won't do it unless he is very much worried, and only



<P>threatens it sometimes, when he gets tired of studying.&nbsp; I often



<P>think I should like to, especially since my hair was cut, so if



<P>you ever miss us, you may advertise for two boys and look among



<P>the ships bound for India."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She laughed as she spoke, and Mr. Laurence looked relieved,



<P>evidently taking the whole as a joke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You hussy, how dare you talk in that way?&nbsp; Where's your



<P>respect for me, and your proper bringing up?&nbsp; Bless the boys



<P>and girls!&nbsp; What torments they are, yet we can't do without



<P>them," he said, pinching her cheeks good-humoredly.&nbsp; "Go and



<P>bring that boy down to his dinner, tell him it's all right, and



<P>advise him not to put on tragedy airs with his grandfather.&nbsp; I



<P>won't bear it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He won't come, Sir.&nbsp; He feels badly because you didn't believe

him



<P>when he said he couldn't tell.&nbsp; I think the shaking hurt his feelings



<P>very much."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo tried to look pathetic but must have failed, for Mr.



<P>Laurence began to laugh, and she knew the day was won.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm sorry for that, and ought to thank him for not shaking



<P>me, I suppose.&nbsp; What the dickens does the fellow expect?" And



<P>the old gentleman looked a trifle ashamed of his own testiness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If I were you, I'd write him an apology, Sir.&nbsp; He says he



<P>won't come down till he has one, and talks about Washington, and



<P>goes on in an absurd way.&nbsp; A formal apology will make him see



<P>how foolish he is, and bring him down quite amiable.&nbsp; Try it.&nbsp;

He



<P>likes fun, and this was is better than talking.&nbsp; I'll carry it



<P>up, and teach him his duty."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Laurence gave her a sharp look, and put on his spectacles,



<P>saying slowly, "You're a sly puss, but I don't mind being



<P>managed by you and Beth.&nbsp; Here, give me a bit of paper,



<P>and let us have done with this nonsense."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The note was written in the terms which one gentleman would



<P>use to another after offering some deep insult.&nbsp; Jo dropped a kiss



<P>on the top of Mr. Laurence's bald head, and ran up to slip the



<P>apology under Laurie's door, advising him through the keyhole to



<P>be submissive, decorous, and a few other agreeable impossibilities.



<P>Finding the door locked again, she left the note to do its work,



<P>and was going quietly away, when the young gentleman slid down



<P>the banisters, and waited for her at the bottom, saying, with his



<P>most virtuous expression of countenance, "What a good fellow you



<P>are, Jo! Did you get blown up?" he added, laughing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, he was pretty mild, on the whole."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"AH!&nbsp; I got it all round.&nbsp; Even you cast me off over there,



<P>and I felt just ready to go to the deuce," he began apologetically.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't talk that way, turn over a new leaf and begin again,



<P>Teddy, my son."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I keep turning over new leaves, and spoiling them, as I



<P>used to spoil my copybooks, and I make so many beginnings there



<P>never will be an end," he said dolefully.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Go and eat your dinner, you'll feel better after it.&nbsp; Men



<P>always croak when they are hungry," and Jo whisked out at the



<P>front door after that.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's a `label' on my `sect'," answered Laurie, quoting



<P>Amy, as he went to partake of humble pie dutifully with his



<P>grandfather, who was quite saintly in temper and overwhelmingly



<P>respectful in manner all the rest of the day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Everyone thought the matter ended and the little cloud



<P>blown over, but the mischief was done, for though others forgot



<P>it, Meg remembered.&nbsp; She never alluded to a certain person, but



<P>she thought of him a good deal, dreamed dreams more than ever,



<P>and once Jo, rummaging her sister's desk for stamps, found a



<P>bit of paper scribbled over with the words, `Mrs. John Brooke',



<P>whereat she groaned tragically and cast it into the fire, feeling



<P>that Laurie's prank had hastened the evil day for her.

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While these things were happening at home, Amy was having



<P>hard times at Aunt March's.&nbsp; She felt her exile deeply, and



<P>for the first time in her life, realized how much she was



<P>beloved and petted at home.&nbsp; Aunt March never petted any one.



<P>She did not approve of it, but she meant to be kind, for the well-



<P>behaved little girl pleased her very much, and Aunt March had



<P>a soft place in her old heart for her nephew's children, though



<P>she didn't think it proper to confess it.&nbsp; She really did her



<P>best to make Amy happy, but, dear me, what mistakes she made.



<P>Some old people keep young at heart in spite of wrinkles and



<P>gray hairs, can sympathize with children's little cares and



<P>joys, make them feel at home, and can hide wise lessons under



<P>pleasant plays, giving and receiving friendship in the sweetest



<P>way.&nbsp; But Aunt March had not this gift, and she worried Amy very



<P>much with her rules and orders, her prim ways, and long, prosy



<P>talks.&nbsp; Finding the child more docile and amiable than her sister,



<P>the old lady felt it her duty to try and counteract, as far as



<P>possible, the bad effects of home freedom and indulgence.&nbsp; So she



<P>took Amy by the hand, and taught her as she herself had been



<P>taught sixty years ago, a process which carried dismay to Amy's



<P>soul, and made her feel like a fly in the web of a very strict



<P>spider.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had to wash the cups every morning, and polish up the



<P>old-fashioned spoons, the fat silver teapot, and the glasses till



<P>they shone.&nbsp; Then she must dust the room, and what a trying job



<P>that was.&nbsp; Not a speck escaped Aunt March's eye, and all the



<P>furniture had claw legs and much carving, which was never dusted



<P>to suit.&nbsp; Then Polly had to be fed, the lap dog combed, and a



<P>dozen trips upstairs and down to get things or deliver orders,



<P>for the old lady was very lame and seldom left her big chair.&nbsp;

After



<P>these tiresome labors, she must do her lessons, which was a daily



<P>trial of every virtue she possessed.&nbsp; Then she was allowed one



<P>hour for exercise or play, and didn't she enjoy it?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie came every day, and wheedled Aunt March till Amy was



<P>allowed to go out with him, when they walked and rode and had



<P>capital times.&nbsp; After dinner, she had to read aloud, and sit still



<P>while the old lady slept, which she usually did for an hour, as



<P>she dropped off over the first page.&nbsp; Then patchwork or towels



<P>appeared, and Amy sewed with outward meekness and inward rebellion



<P>till dusk, when she was allowed to amuse herself as she liked



<P>till teatime.&nbsp; The evenings were the worst of all, for Aunt March



<P>fell to telling long stories about her youth, which were so



<P>unutterably dull that Amy was always ready to go to be, intending



<P>to cry over her hard fate, but usually going to sleep before



<P>she had squeezed out more than a tear or two.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If it had not been for Laurie, and old Esther, the maid,



<P>she felt that she never could have got through that dreadful



<P>time.&nbsp; The parrot alone was enough to drive her distracted, for



<P>he soon felt that she did not admire him, and revenged himself



<P>by being as mischievous as possible.&nbsp; He pulled her hair



<P>whenever she came near him, upset his bread and milk to plague her



<P>when she had newly cleaned his cage, made Mop bark by pecking



<P>at him while Madam dozed, called her names before company, and



<P>behaved in all respects like an reprehensible old bird.&nbsp; Then she



<P>could not endure the dog, a fat, cross beast who snarled and



<P>yelped at her when she made his toilet, and who lay on his back



<P>with all his legs in the air and a most idiotic expression of



<P>countenance when he wanted something to eat, which was about a



<P>dozen times a day.&nbsp; The cook was bad-tempered, the old coachman



<P>was deaf, and Esther the only one who ever took any notice of



<P>the young lady.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Esther was a Frenchwoman, who had lived with`Madame', as



<P>she called her mistress, for many years, and who rather



<P>tyrannized over the old lady, who could not get along without her.



<P>Her real name was Estelle, but Aunt March ordered her to change it,



<P>and she obeyed, on condition that she was never asked to change



<P>her religion.&nbsp; She took a fancy to Mademoiselle, and amused her



<P>very much with odd stories of her life in France, when Amy sat



<P>with her while she got up Madam's laces.&nbsp; She also allowed her



<P>to roam about the great house, and examine the curious and pretty



<P>things stored away in the big wardrobes and the ancient chests,



<P>for Aunt March hoarded like a magpie.&nbsp; Amy's chief delight was



<P>an Indian cabinet, full of queer drawers, little pigeonholes,



<P>and secret places, in which were kept all sorts of ornaments,



<P>some precious, some merely curious, all more or less antique.



<P>To examine and arrange these things gave Amy great satisfaction,



<P>especially the jewel cases, in which on velvet cushions reposed



<P>the ornaments which had adorned a belle forty years ago.&nbsp; There



<P>was the garnet set which Aunt March wore when she came out, the



<P>pearls her father gave her on her wedding day, her lover's diamonds,



<P>the jet mourning rings and pins, the queer lockets, with portraits



<P>of dead friends and weeping willows made of hair inside, the baby



<P>bracelets her one little daughter had worn, Uncle March's big



<P>watch, with the red seal so many childish hands had played with,



<P>and in a box all by itself lay Aunt March's wedding ring, too small



<P>now for her fat finger, but put carefully away like the most



<P>precious jewel of them all.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Which would Mademoiselle choose if she had her will?" asked



<P>Esther, wo always sat near to watch over and lock up the valuables.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I like the diamonds best, but there is no necklace among them,



<P>and I'm fond of necklaces, they are so becoming.&nbsp; I should choose



<P>this if I might," replied Amy, looking with great admiration at a



<P>string of gold and ebony beads from which hung a heavy cross of



<P>the same.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I, too, covet that, but not as a necklace.&nbsp; Ah, no!&nbsp; To me

it



<P>is a rosary, and as such I should use it like a good catholic," said



<P>Esther, eyeing the handsome thing wistfully.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Is it meant to use as you use the string of good-smelling



<P>wooden beads hanging over your glass?" asked Amy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Truly, yes, to pray with.&nbsp; It would be pleasing to the saints



<P>if one used so fine a rosary as this, instead of wearing it as a



<P>vain bijou."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You seem to take a great deal of comfort in your prayers,



<P>Esther, and always come down looking quiet and satisfied.&nbsp; I wish



<P>I could."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If Mademoiselle was a Catholic, she would find true comfort,



<P>but as that is not to be, it would be well if you went apart each



<P>day to meditate and pray, as did the good mistress whom I served



<P>before Madame.&nbsp; She had a little chapel, and in it found solacement



<P>for much trouble."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Would it be right for me to do so too?" asked Amy, who in



<P>her loneliness felt the need of help of some sort, and found that



<P>she was apt to forget her little book, now that Beth was not there



<P>to remind her of it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It would be excellent and charming, and I shall gladly



<P>arrange the little dressing room for you if you like it.&nbsp; Say



<P>nothing to Madame, but when she sleeps go you and sit alone a



<P>while to think good thoughts, and pray the dear God preserve



<P>your sister."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Esther was truly pious, and quite sincere in her advice, for



<P>she had an affectionate heart, and felt much for the sisters in



<P>their anxiety.&nbsp; Amy liked the idea, and gave her leave to arrange



<P>the light closet next her room, hoping it would do her good.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wish I knew where all these pretty things would go when



<P>Aunt March dies," she said, as she slowly replaced the shining



<P>rosary and shut the jewel cases one by one.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To you and your sisters.&nbsp; I know it, Madame confides in me.



<P>I witnessed her will, and it is to be so," whispered Esther smiling.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How nice!&nbsp; But I wish she'd let us have them now.



<P>Procrastination is not agreeable," observed Amy, taking a last



<P>look at the diamonds.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is too soon yet for the young ladies to wear these things.



<P>The first one who is affianced will have the pearls, Madame has said



<P>it, and I have a fancy that the little turquoise ring will be given



<P>to you when you go, for Madame approves your good behavior and



<P>charming manners."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you think so?&nbsp; Oh, I'll be a lamb, if I can only have that



<P>lovely ring!&nbsp; It's ever so much prettier than Kitty Bryant's.&nbsp;

I do



<P>like Aunt March after all." And Amy tried on the blue ring with a



<P>delighted face and a firm resolve to earn it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>From that day she was a model of obedience, and the old lady



<P>complacently admired the success of her training.&nbsp; Esther fitted



<P>up the closet with a little table, placed a footstool before it,



<P>and over it a picture taken from one of the shut-up rooms.&nbsp; She



<P>thought it was of no great value, but, being appropriate, she



<P>borrowed it, well knowing that Madame would never know it, nor



<P>care if she did.&nbsp; It was, however, a very valuable copy of one

of



<P>the famous pictures of the world, and Amy's beauty-loving eyes were



<P>never tired of looking up at the sweet face of the Divine Mother,



<P>while her tender thoughts of her own were busy at her heart.&nbsp; On



<P>the table she laid her little testament and hymnbook, kept a vase



<P>always full of the best flowers Laurie brought her, and came every



<P>day to `sit alone' thinking good thoughts, and praying the dear



<P>God to preserve her sister.&nbsp; Esther had given her a rosary of black



<P>beads with a silver cross, but Amy hung it up and did not use it,



<P>feeling doubtful as to its fitness for Protestant prayers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The little girl was very sincere in all this, for being left



<P>alone outside the safe home nest, she felt the need of some kind



<P>hand to hold by so sorely that she instinctively turned to the



<P>strong and tender Friend, whose fatherly love most closely



<P>surrounds His little children.&nbsp; She missed her mother's help to



<P>understand and rule herself, but having been taught where to look,



<P>she did her best to find the way and walk in it confidingly.&nbsp; But



<P>Amy was a young pilgrim, and just now her burden seemed very heavy.



<P>She tried to forget herself, to keep cheerful, and be satisfied with



<P>doing right, though no one saw or praised her for it.&nbsp; In her first



<P>effort at being very, very good, she decided to make her will, as



<P>Aunt March had done, so that if she did fall ill and die, her



<P>possessions might be justly and generously divided.&nbsp; It cost her

a pang



<P>even to think of giving up the little treasures which in her eyes



<P>were as precious as the old lady's jewels.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>During one of her play hours she wrote out the important



<P>document as well as she could, with some help from Esther as



<P>to certain legal terms, and when the good-natured Frenchwoman



<P>had signed her name, Amy felt relieved and laid it by to show



<P>Laurie, whom she wanted as a second witness.&nbsp; As it was a rainy



<P>day, she went upstairs to amuse herself in one of the large



<P>chambers, and took Polly with her for company.&nbsp; In this room



<P>there was a wardrobe full of old-fashioned costumes with which



<P>Esther allowed her to play, and it was her favorite amusement to



<P>array herself in the faded brocades, and parade up and down before



<P>the long mirror, making stately curtsies, and sweeping her train



<P>about with a rustle which delighted her ears.&nbsp; So busy was she

on



<P>this day that she did not hear Laurie's ring nor see his face



<P>peeping in at her as she gravely promenaded to and fro, flirting



<P>her fan and tossing her head, on which she wore a great pink turban,



<P>contrasting oddly with her blue brocade dress and yellow quilted



<P>petticoat.&nbsp; She was obliged to walk carefully, for she had on



<P>highheeled shoes, and, as Laurie told Jo afterward, it was a comical



<P>sight to see her mince along in her gay suit, with Polly sidilng



<P>and bridling just behind her, imitating her as well as he could,



<P>and occasionally stopping to laugh or exclaim, "Ain't we fine?



<P>Get along, you fright!&nbsp; Hold your tongue!&nbsp; Kiss me, dear!&nbsp;

Ha! Ha!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Having with difficulty restrained an explosion of merriment,



<P>lest it should offend her majesty, Laurie tapped and was graciously



<P>received.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sit down and rest while I put these things away, then I want



<P>to consult you about a very serious matter," said Amy, when she



<P>had shown her splendor and driven Polly into a corner.&nbsp; "That bird



<P>is the trial of my life," she continued, removing the pink mountain



<P>from her head, while Laurie seated himself astride a chair.



<P>"Yesterday, when Aunt was asleep and I was trying to be as still as

a



<P>mouse, Polly began to squall and flap about in his cage, so I went



<P>to let him out, and found a big spider there.&nbsp; I poked it out,

and



<P>it ran under the bookcase.&nbsp; Polly marched straight after it, stooped



<P>down and peeped under the bookcase, saying, in his funny way, with a



<P>cock of his eye, `Come out and take a walk, my dear.' I couldn't help



<P>laughing, which made Poll swear, and Aunt woke up and scolded us both."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Did the spider accept the old fellow's invitation?" asked Laurie, yawning.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, out it came, and away ran Polly, frightened to death, and



<P>scrambled up on Aunt's chair, calling out, `Catch her! Catch her!



<P>Catch her!' as I chased the spider."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's a lie!&nbsp; Oh, lor!" cried the parrot, pecking at Laurie's

toes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'd wring your neck if you were mine, you old torment," cried



<P>Laurie, shaking his fist at the bird, who put his head on one side



<P>and gravely croaked, "Allyluyer!&nbsp; Bless your buttons, dear!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now I'm ready," said Amy, shutting the wardrobe and taking a



<P>piece of paper out of her pocket.&nbsp; "I want you to read that, please,



<P>and tell me if it is legal and right.&nbsp; I felt I ought to do it,

for



<P>life is uncertain and I don't want any ill feeling over my tomb."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie bit his lips, and turning a little from the pensive



<P>speaker, read the following document, with praiseworthy gravity,



<P>considering the spelling:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>MY LAST WILL AND TESTIMENT

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I, Amy Curtis March, being in my sane mind, go give and



<P>bequeethe all my earthly property--viz.to wit:--namely

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To my father, my best pictures, sketches, maps, and works



<P>of art, including frames.&nbsp; Also my $100, to do what he likes with.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To my mother, all my clothes, except the blue apron with



<P>pockets--also my likeness, and my medal, with much love.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To my dear sister Margaret, I give my turkquoise ring (if I



<P>get it), also my green box with the doves on it, also my; piece



<P>of real lace for her neck, and my sketch of her as a memorial of



<P>her 'little girl'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To Jo I leave my breastpin, the one mended with sealing wax,



<P>also my bronze inkstand--she lost the cover--and my most precious



<P>plaster rabbit, because I am sorry I burned up her story.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To Beth (if she lives after me) I give my dolls and the



<P>little bureau, my fan, my linen collars and my new slippers if



<P>she can wear them being thin when she gets well.&nbsp; And I herewith



<P>also leave her my regret that I ever made fun of old Joanna.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To my friend and neighbor Theodore Laurence I bequeethe my



<P>paper mashay portfolio, my clay model of a horse though he did



<P>say it hadn't any neck.&nbsp; Also in return for his great kindness



<P>in the hour of affliction any one of my artistic works he likes,



<P>Noter Dame is the best.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To our venerable benefactor Mr. Laurence I leave my purple



<P>box with a looking glass in the cover which will be nice for



<P>his pens and remind him of the departed girl who thanks him



<P>for his favors to her family, especially Beth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I wish my favorite playmate Kitty Bryant to have the blue



<P>silk apron and my gold-bead ring with a kiss.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To Hannah I give the bandbox she wanted and all the patchwork



<P>I leave hoping she `will remember me, when it you see'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And now having disposed of my most valuable property I hope



<P>all will be satisfied and not blame the dead.&nbsp; I forgive everyone,



<P>and trust we may all meet when the trump shall sound.&nbsp; Amen.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To this will and testiment I set my hand and seal on this



<P>20th day of Nov.&nbsp; Anni Domino 1861.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy Curtis March

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Witnesses:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Estelle Valnor,



<P>Theodore Laurence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The last name was written in pencil, and Amy explained



<P>that he was to rewrite it in ink and seal it up for her properly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What put it into your head?&nbsp; Did anyone tell you about Beth's



<P>giving away her things?" asked Laurie soberly, as Amy laid a bit



<P>of red tape, with sealing wax, a taper, and a standish before him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She explained and then asked anxiously, "What about Beth?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm sorry I spoke, but as I did, I'll tell you.&nbsp; She felt so



<P>ill one day that she told Jo she wanted to give her piano to Meg,



<P>her cats to you, and the poor old doll to Jo, who would love it for



<P>her sake.&nbsp; She was sorry she had so little to give, and left locks



<P>of hair to the rest of us, and her best love to Grandpa.&nbsp; She never



<P>thought of a will."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie was signing and sealing as he spoke, and did not look



<P>up till a great tear dropped on the paper.&nbsp; Amy's face was full



<P>of trouble, but she only said, "Don't people put sort of



<P>postscripts to their wills, sometimes?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, `codicils', they call them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Put one in mine then, that I wish all my curls cut off, and



<P>given round to my friends.&nbsp; I forgot it, but I want it done though



<P>it will spoil my looks."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie added it, smiling at Amy's last and greatest sacrifice.



<P>Then he amused her for an hour, and was much interested in all her



<P>trials.&nbsp; But when he came to go, Amy held him back to whisper with



<P>trembling lips, "Is there really any danger about Beth?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm afraid there is, but we must hope for the best, so don't



<P>cry, dear."&nbsp; And Laurie put his arm about her with a brotherly



<P>gesture which was very comforting.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When he had gone, she went to her little chapel, and sitting



<P>in the twilight, prayed for Beth, with streaming tears and an



<P>aching heart, feeling that a million turquoise rings would not



<P>console her for the loss of her gentle little sister.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The June roses over the porch were awake bright and early on



<P>that morning, rejoicing with all their hearts in the cloudless



<P>sunshine, like friendly little neighbors, as they were.&nbsp; Quite

flushed



<P>with excitement were their ruddy faces, as they swung in the wind,



<P>whispering to one another what they had seen, for some peeped in at



<P>the dining room windows where the feast was spread, some climbed up



<P>to nod and smile at the sisters as they dressed the bride, others



<P>waved a welcome to those who came and went on various errands in



<P>garden, porch, and hall, and all, from the rosiest full-blown



<P>flower to the palest baby bud, offered their tribute of beauty and



<P>fragrance to the gentle mistress who had loved and tended them so



<P>long.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg looked very like a rose herself, for all that was best and



<P>sweetest in heart and soul seemed to bloom into her face that day,



<P>making it fair and tender, with a charm more beautiful than beauty.



<P>Neither silk, lace, nor orange flowers would she have.&nbsp; "I don't



<P>want a fashionable wedding, but only those about me whom I love,



<P>and to them I wish to look and be my familiar self."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So she made her wedding gown herself, sewing into it the tender



<P>hopes and innocent romances of a girlish heart.&nbsp; her sisters braided



<P>up her pretty hair, and the only ornaments she wore were the lilies



<P>of the valley, which `her John' liked best of all the flowers that



<P>grew.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You do look just like our own dear Meg, only so very sweet



<P>and lovely that I should hug you if it wouldn't crumple your dress,"



<P>cried Amy, surveying her with delight when all was done.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then I am satisfied.&nbsp; But please hug and kiss me, everyone,



<P>and don't mind my dress.&nbsp; I want a great many crumples of this



<P>sort put into it today."&nbsp; And Meg opened her arms to her sisters,



<P>who clung about her with April faces for a minute, feeling that



<P>the new love had not changed the old.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now I'm going to tie John's cravat for him, and then to stay



<P>a few minutes with Father quietly in the study."&nbsp; And Meg ran



<P>down to perform these little ceremonies, and then to follow her



<P>mother wherever she went, conscious that in spite of the smiles



<P>on the motherly face, there was a secret sorrow hid in the motherly



<P>heart at the flight of the first bird from the nest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As the younger girls stand together, giving the last touches



<P>to their simple toilet, it may be a good time to tell of a few



<P>changes which three years have wrought in their appearance, for



<P>all are looking their best just now.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo's angles are much softened, she has learned to carry herself



<P>with ease, if not grace.&nbsp; The curly crop has lengthened into



<P>a thick coil, more becoming to the small head atop of the tall



<P>figure.&nbsp; There is a fresh color in her brown cheeks, a soft shine



<P>in her eyes, and only gentle words fall from her sharp tongue today.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Beth has grown slender, pale, and more quiet than ever.&nbsp; The



<P>beautiful, kind eyes are larger, and in them lies an expression



<P>that saddens one, although it is not sad itself.&nbsp; It is the shadow



<P>of pain which touches the young face with such pathetic patience,



<P>but Beth seldom complains and always speaks hopefully of `being



<P>better soon'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy is with truth considered `the flower of the family', for



<P>at sixteen she has the air and bearing of a full-grown woman, not



<P>beautiful, but possessed of that indescribable charm called grace.



<P>One saw it in the lines of her figure, the make and motion of her



<P>hands, the flow of her dress, the droop of her hair, unconscious



<P>yet harmonious, and as attractive to many as beauty itself.&nbsp; Amy's



<P>nose still afflicted her, for it never would grow Grecian, so did



<P>her mouth, being too wide, and having a decided chin.&nbsp; These offending



<P>features gave character to her whole face, but she never could see it,



<P>and consoled herself with her wonderfully fair complexion,



<P>keen blue eyes, and curls more golden and abundant than ever.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>All three wore suits of thin silver gray (their best gowns for



<P>the summer), with blush roses in hair and bosom, and all three



<P>looked just what they were, fresh-faced, happy-hearted girls, pausing



<P>a moment in their busy lives to read with wistful eyes the sweetest



<P>chapter in the romance of womanhood.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There were to be no ceremonious performances, everything was



<P>to be as natural and homelike as possible, so when Aunt March arrived,



<P>she was scandalized to see the bride come running to welcome and lead

her in,



<P>to find the bridegroom fastening up a garland that had fallen down,



<P>and to catch a glimpse of the paternal minister marching upstairs



<P>with a grave countenance and a wine bottle under each arm.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Upon my word, here's a state of things!" cried the old lady,



<P>taking the seat of honor prepared for her, and settling the folds



<P>of her lavender moire with a great rustle.&nbsp; "You oughtn't to be



<P>seen till the last minute, child."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm not a show, Aunty, and no one is coming to stare at me,



<P>to criticize my dress, or count the cost of my luncheon.&nbsp; I'm too



<P>happy to care what anyone says or thinks, and I'm going to have



<P>my little wedding just as I like it.&nbsp; John, dear, here's your



<P>hammer."&nbsp; And away went Meg to help `that man' in his highly



<P>improper employment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Brooke didn't even say, "Thank you," but as he stooped



<P>for the unromantic tool, he kissed his little bride behind the



<P>folding door, with a look that made Aunt March whisk out her



<P>pocket handkerchief with a sudden dew in her sharp old eyes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A crash, a cry, and a laugh from Laurie, accompanied by the



<P>indecorous exclamation, "Jupiter Ammon!&nbsp; Jo's upset the cake again!"



<P>caused a momentary flurry, which was hardly over when a flock of



<P>cousins arrived, and `the party came in', as Beth used to say when



<P>a child.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't let that young giant come near me, he worries me worse



<P>than mosquitoes," whispered the old lady to Amy, as the rooms filled



<P>and Laurie's black head towered above the rest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He has promised to be very good today, and he can be perfectly



<P>elegant if he likes," returned Amy, and gliding away to warn



<P>Hercules to beware of the dragon, which warning caused him to haunt



<P>the old lady with a devotion that nearly distracted her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was no bridal procession, but a sudden silence fell upon



<P>the room as Mr. March and the young couple took their places under



<P>the green arch.&nbsp; Mother and sisters gathered close, as if loath

to



<P>give Meg up.&nbsp; The fatherly voice broke more than once, which only



<P>seemed to make the service more beautiful and solemn.&nbsp; The bridegroom's



<P>hand trembled visibly, and no one heard his replies.&nbsp; But Meg



<P>looked straight up in her husband's eyes, and said, "I will!"



<P>with such tender trust in her own face and voice that her mother's



<P>heart rejoiced and Aunt March sniffed audibly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo did not cry, though she was very near it once, and was only



<P>saved from a demonstration by the consciousness that Laurie was



<P>staring fixedly at her, with a comical mixture of merriment and



<P>emotion in his wicked black eyes.&nbsp; Beth kept her face hidden on

her



<P>mother's shoulder, but Amy stood like a graceful statue, with a



<P>most becoming ray of sunshine touching her white forehead and the



<P>flower in her hair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It wasn't at all the thing, I'm afraid, but the minute she was



<P>fairly married, Meg cried, "The first kiss for Marmee!" and turning,



<P>gave it with her heart on her lips.&nbsp; During the next fifteen minutes



<P>she looked more like a rose than ever, for everyone availed themselves



<P>of their privileges to the fullest extent, from Mr. Laurence



<P>to old Hannah, who, adorned with a headdress fearfully and



<P>wonderfully made, fell upon her in the hall, crying with a sob



<P>and a chuckle, "Bless you, deary, a hundred times!&nbsp; The cake ain't



<P>hurt a mite, and everything looks lovely."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Everybody cleared up after that, and said something brilliant,



<P>or tried to, which did just as well, for laughter is ready when



<P>hearts are light.&nbsp; There was no display of gifts, for they were



<P>already in the little house, nor was there an elaborate breakfast,



<P>but a plentiful lunch of cake and fruit, dressed with flowers.



<P>Mr. Laurence and Aunt March shrugged and smiled at one another when



<P>water, lemonade, and coffee were found to be to only sorts of



<P>nectar which the three Hebes carried around.&nbsp; No one said anything,



<P>till Laurie, who insisted on serving the bride, appeared before her,



<P>with a loaded salver in his hand and a puzzled expression on his face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Has Jo smashed all the bottles by accident?" he whispered,



<P>"or am I merely laboring under a delusion that I saw some lying



<P>about loose this morning?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, your grandfather kindly offered us his best, and Aunt



<P>March actually sent some, but Father put away a little for Beth,



<P>and dispatched the rest to the Soldier's Home.&nbsp; You know he thinks



<P>that wine should be used only in illness, and Mother says that



<P>neither she nor her daughters will ever offer it to any young man



<P>under her roof."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg spoke seriously and expected to see Laurie frown or laugh,



<P>but he did neither, for after a quick look at her, he said, in



<P>his impetuous way, "I like that!&nbsp; For I've seen enough harm done



<P>to wish other women would think as you do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are not made wise by experience, I hope?" And there was



<P>an anxious accent in Meg's voice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No.&nbsp; I give you my word for it.&nbsp; Don't think too well of

me,



<P>either, this is not one of my temptations.&nbsp; Being brought up where



<P>wine is as common as water and almost as harmless, I don't care for



<P>it, but when a pretty girl offers it, one doesn't like to refuse,



<P>you see."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But you will, for the sake of others, if not for your own.



<P>Come, Laurie, promise, and give me one more reason to call this the



<P>happiest day of my life."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A demand so sudden and so serious made the young man hesitate



<P>a moment, for ridicule is often harder to bear than self-denial.



<P>Meg knew that if he gave the promise he would keep it at all costs,



<P>and feeling her power, used it as a woman may for her friend's good.



<P>She did not speak, but she looked up at him with a face made very



<P>eloquent by happiness, and a smile which said, "No one can refuse



<P>me anything today."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie certainly could not, and with an answering smile, he



<P>gave her his hand, saying heartily, "I promise, Mrs. Brooke!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I thank you, very, very much."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And I drink `long life to your resolution', Teddy," cried Jo,



<P>baptizing him with a splash of lemonade, as she waved her glass and



<P>beamed approvingly upon him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So the toast was drunk, the pledge made and loyally kept in



<P>spite of many temptations, for with instinctive wisdom, the girls



<P>seized a happy moment to do their friend a service, for which he



<P>thanked them all his life.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After lunch, people strolled about, by twos and threes, through



<P>the house and garden, enjoying the sunshine without and within.&nbsp;

Meg



<P>and John happened to be standing together in the middle of the grass



<P>plot, when Laurie was seized with an inspiration which put the



<P>finishing touch to this unfashionable wedding.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"All the married people take hands and dance round the new-made



<P>husband and wife, as the Germans do, while we bachelors and spinsters



<P>prance in couples outside!" cried Laurie, promenading down the path



<P>with Amy, with such infectious spirit and skill that everyone else



<P>followed their example without a murmur.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. March, Aunt



<P>and Uncle Carrol began it, others rapidly joined in, even Sallie



<P>Moffat, after a moment's hesitation, threw her train over her arm



<P>and whisked Ned into the ring.&nbsp; But the crowning joke was Mr.



<P>Laurence and Aunt March, for when the stately old gentleman chass'ed



<P>solemnly up to the old lady, she just tucked her cane under arm, and



<P>hopped briskly away to join hands with the rest and dance about the



<P>bridal pair, while the young folks pervaded the garden like butterflies



<P>on a midsummer day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Want of breath brought the impromptu ball to a close, and then



<P>people began to go.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wish you well, my dear, I heartily wish you well, but I think



<P>you'll be sorry for it," said Aunt March to Meg, adding to the



<P>bridegroom, as he led her to the carriage, "You've got a treasure,



<P>young man, see that you deserve it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That is the prettiest wedding I've been to for an age, Ned, and



<P>I don't see why, for there wasn't a bit of style about it," observed



<P>Mrs. Moffat to her husband, as they drove away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Laurie, my lad, if you ever want to indulge in this sort of



<P>thing, get one of those little girls to help you, and I shall be



<P>perfectly satisfied," said Mr. Laurence, settling himself in his



<P>easy chair to rest after the excitement of the morning.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll do my best to gratify you, Sir," was Laurie's unusually



<P>dutiful reply, as he carefully unpinned the posy Jo had put in his



<P>buttonhole.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The little house was not far away, and the only bridal journey



<P>Meg had was the quiet walk with John from the old home to the new.



<P>When she came down, looking like a pretty Quakeress in her



<P>dovecolored suit and straw bonnet tied with white, they all gathered



<P>about her to say goodby, as tenderly as if she had been going to



<P>make the grand tour.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't feel that I am separated from you, Marmee dear, or that



<P>I love you any the less for loving John so much," she said, clinging



<P>to her mother, with full eyes for a moment.&nbsp; "I shall come every

day,



<P>Father, and expect to keep my old place in all your hearts, though I



<P>am married.&nbsp; Beth is going to be with me a great deal, and the

other



<P>girls will drop in now and then to laugh at my housekeeping struggles.



<P>Thank you all for my happy wedding day.&nbsp; Goodby, goodby!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They stood watching her, with faces full of love and hope and



<P>tender pride as she walked away, leaning on her husband's arm, with



<P>her hands full of flowers and the June sunshine brightening her happy



<P>face--and so Meg's married life began.

<P>London

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Dearest People,



<P>Here I really sit at a front window of the Bath Hotel,



<P>Piccadilly.&nbsp; It's not a fashionable place, but Uncle stopped



<P>here years ago, and won't go anywhere else.&nbsp; However, we don't



<P>mean to stay long, so it's no great matter.&nbsp; Oh, I can't begin



<P>to tell you how I enjoy it all!&nbsp; I never can, so I'll only give



<P>you bits out of my notebook, for I've done nothing but sketch



<P>and scribble since I started.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I sent a line from Halifax, when I felt pretty miserable,



<P>but after that I got on delightfully, seldom ill, on deck all



<P>day, with plenty of pleasant people to amuse me.&nbsp; Everyone was



<P>very kind to me, especially the officers.&nbsp; Don't laugh, Jo,



<P>gentlemen really are very necessary aboard ship, to hold on to,



<P>or to wait upon one, and as they have nothing to do, it's a mercy



<P>to make them useful, otherwise they would smoke themselves to death,



<P>I'm afraid.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Aunt and Flo were poorly all the way, and liked to be let



<P>alone, so when I had done what I could for them, I went and



<P>enjoyed myself.&nbsp; Such walks on deck, such sunsets, such splendid



<P>air and waves!&nbsp; It was almost as exciting as riding a fast horse,



<P>when we went rushing on so grandly.&nbsp; I wish Beth could have come,



<P>it would have done her so much good.&nbsp; As for Jo, she would have



<P>gone up and sat on the maintop jib, or whatever the high thing



<P>is called, made friends with the engineers, and tooted on the



<P>captain's speaking trumpet, she'd have been in such a state of



<P>rapture.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was all heavenly, but I was glad to see the Irish coast,



<P>and found it very lovely, so green and sunny, with brown cabins



<P>here and there, ruins on some of the hills, and gentlemen's



<P>countryseats in the valleys, with deer feeding in the parks.



<P>It was early in the morning, but I didn't regret getting up to



<P>see it, for the bay was full of little boats, the shore so picturesque,



<P>and a rosy sky overhead.&nbsp; I never shall forget it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At Queenstown on of my new acquaintances left us, Mr.



<P>Lennox, and when I said something about the Lakes of Killarney,



<P>he sighed and and, with a look at me...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, have you e'er heard of Kate Kearney?



<P>She lives on the banks of Killarney;



<P>From the glance of her eye,



<P>Shun danger and fly,



<P>For fatal's the glance of Kate Kearney."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Wasn't that nonsensical?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>We only stopped at Liverpool a few hours.&nbsp; It's a dirty,



<P>noisy place, and I was glad to leave it.&nbsp; Uncle rushed out and



<P>bought a pair of dogskin gloves, some ugly, thick shoes, and an



<P>umbrella, and got shaved `a la mutton chop, the first thing.



<P>Then he flattered himself that he looked like a true Briton,



<P>but the first time he had the mud cleaned off his shoes, the



<P>little bootblack knew that an American stood in them, and said,



<P>with a grin, "There yer har, sir.&nbsp; I've given `em the latest



<P>Yankee shine."&nbsp; It amused Uncle immensely.&nbsp; Oh, I must tell

you



<P>what that absurd Lennox did!&nbsp; He got his friend Ward, who came



<P>on with us, to order a bouquet for me, and the first thing I



<P>saw in my room was a lovely one, with "Robert Lennox's compliments,"



<P>on the card.&nbsp; Wasn't that fun, girls? I like traveling.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I never shall get to London if I don't hurry.&nbsp; The trip was



<P>like riding through a long picture gallery, full of lovely landscapes.



<P>The farmhouses were my delight, with thatched roofs,



<P>ivy up to the eaves, latticed windows, and stout women with rosy



<P>children at the doors.&nbsp; The very cattle looked more tranquil



<P>than ours, as they stood knee-deep in clover, and the hens had



<P>a contented cluck, as if they never got nervous like Yankee



<P>biddies.&nbsp; Such perfect color I never saw, the grass so green, sky



<P>so blue, grain so yellow, woods so dark, I was in a rapture all



<P>the way.&nbsp; So was Flo, and we kept bouncing from one side to the



<P>other, trying to see everything while we were whisking along at



<P>the rate of sixty miles an hour.&nbsp; Aunt was tired and went to sleep,



<P>but Uncle read his guidebook, and wouldn't be astonished at anything.



<P>This is the way we went on.&nbsp; Amy, flying up--"Oh, that



<P>must be Kenilworth, that gray place among the trees!"&nbsp; Flo, darting



<P>to my window--"How sweet!&nbsp; We must go there sometime, won't we



<P>Papa?" Uncle, calmly admiring his boots--"No, my dear, not unless



<P>you want beer, that's a brewery."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A pause--then Flo cried out, "Bless me, there's a gallows and



<P>a man going up."&nbsp; "Where, where?" shrieks Amy, staring out at two



<P>tall posts with a crossbeam and some dangling chains.&nbsp; "A colliery,"



<P>remarks Uncle, with a twinkle of the eye.&nbsp; "Here's a lovely flock



<P>of lambs all lying down," says Amy.&nbsp; "See, Papa, aren't they



<P>pretty?" added Flo sentimentally.&nbsp; "Geese, young ladies," returns



<P>Uncle, in a tone that keeps us quiet till Flo settles down to



<P>enjoy the FLIRTATIONS OF CAPTAIN CAVENDISH, and I have the scenery



<P>all to myself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Of course it rained when we got to London, and there was



<P>nothing to be seen but fog and umbrellas.&nbsp; We rested, unpacked,



<P>and shopped a little between the showers.&nbsp; Aunt Mary got me some



<P>new things, for I came off in such a hurry I wasn't half ready.



<P>A white hat and blue feather, a muslin dress to match, and the



<P>loveliest mantle you ever saw.&nbsp; Shopping in Regent Street is



<P>perfectly splendid.&nbsp; Things seem so cheap, nice ribbons only



<P>sixpence a yard.&nbsp; I laid in a stock, but shall get my gloves



<P>in Paris.&nbsp; Doesn't that sound sort of elegant and rich?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Flo and I, for the fun of it, ordered a hansom cab, while



<P>Aunt and Uncle were out, and went for a drive, though we learned



<P>afterward that it wasn't the thing for young ladies to ride in



<P>them alone.&nbsp; It was so droll!&nbsp; For when we were shut in by

the



<P>wooden apron, the man drove so fast that Flo was frightened, and



<P>told me to stop him.&nbsp; but he was up outside behind somewhere,



<P>and I couldn't get at him.&nbsp; He didn't hear me call, nor see me



<P>flap my parasol in front, and there we were, quite helpless,



<P>rattling away, and whirling around corners at a breakneck pace.



<P>At last, in my despair, I saw a little door in the roof, and on



<P>poking it open, a red eye appeared, and a beery voice said...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now, then, mum?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I gave my order as soberly as I could, and slamming down



<P>the door, with an "Aye, aye, mum," the man made his horse walk,



<P>as if going to a funeral.&nbsp; I poked again and said, "A little



<P>faster," then off he went, helter-skelter as before, and we



<P>resigned ourselves to our fate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Today was fair, and we went to Hyde Park, close by, for we



<P>are more aristocratic than we look.&nbsp; The Duke of Devonshire lives



<P>near.&nbsp; I often see his footmen lounging at the back gate, and



<P>the Duke of Wellington's house is not far off.&nbsp; Such sights as

I



<P>saw, my dear!&nbsp; It was as good as Punch, for there were fat dowagers



<P>rolling about in their red and yellow coaches, with gorgeous



<P>Jeameses in silk stockings and velvet coats, up behind, and powdered



<P>coachmen in front.&nbsp; Smart maids, with the rosiest children



<P>I ever saw, handsome girls, looking half asleep, dandies in queer



<P>English hats and lavender kids lounging about, and tall soldiers,



<P>in short red jackets and muffin caps stuck on one side, looking



<P>so funny I longed to sketch them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Rotten Row means `Route de Roi', or the king's way, but



<P>now it's more like a riding school than anything else.&nbsp; The



<P>horses are splendid, and the men, especially the grooms, ride



<P>well, but the women are stiff, and bounce, which isn't according



<P>to our rules.&nbsp; I longed to show them a tearing American



<P>gallop, for they trotted solemnly up and down, in their scant



<P>habits and high hats, looking like the women in a toy Noah's



<P>Ark.&nbsp; Everyone rides--old men, stout ladies, little children--



<P>and the young folks do a deal of flirting here, I say a pair



<P>exchange rose buds, for it's the thing to wear one in the



<P>button-hole, and I thought it rather a nice little idea.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the P.M.&nbsp; to Westminster Abbey, but don't expect me to



<P>describe it, that's impossible, so I'll only say it was sublime!



<P>This evening we are going to see Fechter, which will be an appropriate



<P>end to the happiest day of my life.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It's very late, but I can't let my letter go in the morning



<P>without telling you what happened last evening.&nbsp; Who do



<P>you think came in, as we were at tea?&nbsp; Laurie's English friends,



<P>Fred and Frank Vaughn!&nbsp; I was so surprised, for I shouldn't have



<P>known them but for the cards.&nbsp; both are tall fellows with whiskers,



<P>Fred handsome in the English style, and Frank much better,



<P>for he only limps slightly, and uses no crutches.&nbsp; They had heard



<P>from Laurie where we were to be, and came to ask us to their



<P>house, but Uncle won't go, so we shall return the call, and see



<P>them as we can.&nbsp; They went to the theater with us, and we did



<P>have such a good time, for Frank devoted himself to Flo, and



<P>Fred and I talked over past, present, and future fun as if we



<P>had know each other all our days.&nbsp; Tell Beth Frank asked for her,



<P>and was sorry to hear of her ill health.&nbsp; Fred laughed when I



<P>spoke of Jo, and sent his `respectful compliments to the big hat'.



<P>Neither of them had forgotten Camp Laurence, or the fun we had



<P>there.&nbsp; What ages ago it seems, doesn't it?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Aunt is tapping on the wall for the third time, so I must



<P>stop.&nbsp; I really feel like a dissipated London fine lady, writing



<P>here so late, with my room full of pretty things, and my head



<P>a jumble of parks, theaters, new gowns, and gallant creatures



<P>who say "Ah!" and twirl their blond mustaches with the true



<P>English lordliness.&nbsp; I long to see you all, and in spite of my



<P>nonsense am, as ever, your loving...



<P>AMY

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>PARIS

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Dear girls,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In my last I told you about our London visit, how kind the



<P>Vaughns were, and what pleasant parties they made for us.&nbsp; I enjoyed



<P>the trips to Hampton Court and the Kensington Museum more than



<P>anything else, for at Hampton I saw Raphael's cartoons, and



<P>at the Museum, rooms full of pictures by Turner, Lawrence, Reynolds,



<P>Hogarth, and the other great creatures.&nbsp; The day in Richmond



<P>Park was charming, for we had a regular English picnic, and



<P>I had more splendid oaks and groups of deer than I could copy,



<P>also heard a nightingale, and saw larks go up.&nbsp; We `did' London



<P>to our heart's content, thanks to Fred and Frank, and were sorry



<P>to go away, for though English people are slow to take you in,



<P>when they once make up their minds to do it they cannot be outdone



<P>in hospitality, I think.&nbsp; The Vaughns hope to meet us in



<P>Rome next winter, and I shall be dreadfully disappointed if they



<P>don't, for Grace and I are great friends, and the boys very



<P>nice fellows, especially Fred.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well, we were hardly settled here, when he turned up again,



<P>saying he had come for a holiday, and was going to Switzerland.



<P>Aunt looked sober at first, but he was so cool about it she



<P>couldn't say a word.&nbsp; And now we get on nicely, and are very



<P>glad he came, for he speaks French like a native, and I don't



<P>know what we should do without him.&nbsp; Uncle doesn't know ten



<P>words, and insists on talking English very loud, as if it



<P>would make people understand him.&nbsp; Aunt's pronunciation is



<P>old-fashioned, and Flo and I, though we flattered ourselves



<P>that we knew a good deal, find we don't, and are very grateful



<P>to have Fred do the `parley vooing', as Uncle calls it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Such delightful times as we are having!&nbsp; Sight-seeing from



<P>morning till night, stopping for nice lunches in the gay cafes,



<P>and meeting with all sorts of droll adventures.&nbsp; Rainy days I



<P>spend in the Louvre, revelling in pictures.&nbsp; Jo would turn up



<P>her naughty nose at some of the finest, because she has no



<P>soul for art, but I have, and I'm cultivation eye and taste



<P>as fast as I can.&nbsp; She would like the relics of great people



<P>better, for I've seen her Napoleon's cocked hat and gray



<P>coat, his baby's cradle and his old toothbrush, also Marie



<P>Antoinette's little shoe, the ring of Saint Denis, Charlemagne's



<P>sword, and many other interesting things.&nbsp; I'll talk for hours



<P>about them when I come, but haven't time to write.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Palais Royale is a heavenly place, so full of bijouterie



<P>and lovely things that I'm nearly distracted because I can't



<P>buy them.&nbsp; Fred wanted to get me some, but of course I didn't



<P>allow it.&nbsp; Then the Bois and Champs Elysees are tres magnifique.



<P>I've seen the imperial family several times, the emperor an ugly,



<P>hard-looking man, the empress pale and pretty, but dressed in



<P>bad taste, I thought--purple dress, green hat, and yellow gloves.



<P>Little Nap is a handsome boy, who sits chatting to his tutor,



<P>and kissed his hand to the people as he passes in his four-horse



<P>barouche, with postilions in red satin jackets and a mounted



<P>guard before and behind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>We often walk in the Tuileries Gardens, for they are



<P>lovely, though the antique Luxembourg Gardens suit me better.



<P>Pere la Chaise is very curious, for many of the tombs are



<P>like small rooms, and looking in, one sees a table, with



<P>images or pictures of the dead, and chairs for the mourners



<P>to sit in when they come to lament.&nbsp; That is so Frenchy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Our rooms are on the Rue de Rivoli, and sitting on the



<P>balcony, we look up and down the long, brilliant street.&nbsp; It



<P>is so pleasant that we spend our evenings talking there when



<P>too tired with our day's work to go out.&nbsp; Fred is very entertaining,



<P>and is altogether the most agreeable young man I ever knew--



<P>except Laurie, whose manners are more charming.&nbsp; I wish Fred



<P>was dark, for I don't fancy light men, however, the Vaughns



<P>are very rich and come of an excellent family, so I won't



<P>find fault with their yellow hair, as my own is yellower.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Next week we are off to Germany and Switzerland, and as



<P>we shall travel fast, I shall only be able to give you hasty



<P>letters.&nbsp; I keep my diary, and try to `remember correctly and



<P>describe clearly all that I see and admire', as Father advised.



<P>It is good practice for me, and with my sketchbook will give



<P>you a better idea of my tour than these scribbles.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Adieu, I embrace you tenderly.



<P>VOTRE AMIE

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>HEIDELBERG

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>My dear Mamma,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Having a quiet hour before we leave for Berne, I'll try to



<P>tell you what has happened, for some of it is very important,



<P>as you will see.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The sail up the Rhine was perfect, and I just sat and enjoyed



<P>it with all my might.&nbsp; Get Father's old guidebooks and



<P>read about it.&nbsp; I haven't words beautiful enough to describe it.



<P>At Coblenz we had a lovely time, for some students from Bonn,



<P>with whom Fred got acquainted on the boat, gave us a serenade.



<P>It was a moonlight night, and about one o'clock Flo and I were



<P>waked by the most delicious music under our windows.&nbsp; We flew up,



<P>and hid behind the curtains, but sly peeps showed us Fred and



<P>the students singing away down below.&nbsp; It was the most romantic



<P>thing I ever saw--the river, the bridge of boats, the great fortress



<P>opposite, moonlight everywhere, and music fit to melt a heart of stone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When they were done we threw down some flowers, and saw



<P>them scramble for them, kiss their hands to the invisible ladies,



<P>and go laughing away, to smoke and drink beer, I suppose.&nbsp; Next



<P>morning Fred showed me one of the crumpled flowers in his vest



<P>pocket, and looked very sentimental.&nbsp; I laughed at him, and said



<P>I didn't throw it, but Flo, which seemed to disgust him, for he



<P>tossed it out of the window, and turned sensible again.&nbsp; I'm



<P>afraid I'm going to have trouble with that boy, it begins to



<P>look like it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The baths at Nassau were very gay, so was Baden-Baden,



<P>where Fred lost some money, and I scolded him.&nbsp; He needs someone



<P>to look after him when Frank is not with him.&nbsp; Kate said



<P>once she hoped he'd marry soon, and I quite agree with her



<P>that it would be well for him.&nbsp; Frankfurt was delightful.&nbsp;

I



<P>saw Goeth's house, Schiller's statue, and Dannecker's famous



<P>Ariadne.&nbsp; It was very lovely, but I should have enjoyed it



<P>more if I had known the story better.&nbsp; I didn't like to ask, as



<P>everyone knew it or pretended they did.&nbsp; I wish Jo would tell



<P>me all about it.&nbsp; I ought to have read more, for I find I don't



<P>know anything, and it mortifies me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now comes the serious part, for it happened here, and Fred



<P>has just gone.&nbsp; He has been so kind and jolly that we all got



<P>quite fond of him.&nbsp; I never thought of anything but a traveling



<P>friendship till the serenade night.&nbsp; Since then I've begun to



<P>feel that the moonlight walks, balcony talks, and daily adventures



<P>were something more to him than fun.&nbsp; I haven't flirted,



<P>Mother, truly, but remembered what you said to me, and have done



<P>my very best.&nbsp; I can't help it if people like me.&nbsp; I don't

try to



<P>make them, and it worries me if I don't care for them, though Jo



<P>says I haven't got any heart.&nbsp; Now I know Mother will shake her



<P>head, and the girls say, "Oh, the mercenary little wretch!", but



<P>I've made up my mind, and if Fred asks me, I shall accept him,



<P>though I'm not madly in love.&nbsp; I like him, and we get on comfortably



<P>together.&nbsp; He is handsome, young, clever enough, and very



<P>rich--ever so much richer than the Laurences.&nbsp; I don't think his



<P>family would object, and I should be very happy, for they are all



<P>kind, well-bred, generous people, and they like me.&nbsp; Fred, as the



<P>eldest twin, will have the estate, I suppose, and such a splendid



<P>one it is!&nbsp; A city house in a fashionable street, not so showy



<P>as our big houses, but twice as comfortable and full of solid



<P>luxury, such as English people believe in.&nbsp; I like it, for it's



<P>genuine.&nbsp; I've seen the plate, the family jewels, the old servants,



<P>and pictures of the country place, with its park, great house,



<P>lovely grounds, and fine horses.&nbsp; Oh, it would be all I should



<P>ask!&nbsp; And I'd rather have it than any title such as girls snap



<P>up so readily, and find nothing behind.&nbsp; I may be mercenary,



<P>but I hate poverty, and don't mean to bear it a minute longer



<P>than I can help.&nbsp; One of us must marry well.&nbsp; Meg didn't,

Jo



<P>won't, Beth can't yet, so I shall, and make everything okay all



<P>round.&nbsp; I wouldn't marry a man I hated or despised.&nbsp; You may

be



<P>sure of that, and though Fred is not my model hero, he does very



<P>well, and in time I should get fond enough of him if he was very



<P>fond of me, and let me do just as I liked.&nbsp; So I've been turning



<P>the matter over in my mind the last week, for it was impossible to



<P>help seeing that Fred liked me.&nbsp; He said nothing, but little things



<P>showed it.&nbsp; He never goes with Flo, always gets on my side of the



<P>carriage, table, or promenade, looks sentimental when we are alone,



<P>and frowns at anyone else who ventures to speak tome.&nbsp; Yesterday



<P>at dinner, when an Austrian officer stared at us and then said



<P>something to his friend, a rakish-looking baron, about `ein wonderschones



<P>Blondchen', Fred looked as fierce as a lion, and cut his meat



<P>so savagely it nearly flew off his plate.&nbsp; He isn't one of the



<P>cool, stiff Englishmen, but is rather peppery, for he has Scotch



<P>blood in him, as one might guess from his bonnie blue eyes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well, last evening we went up to the castle about sunset, at



<P>least all of us but Fred, who was to meet us there after going to



<P>the Post Restante for letters.&nbsp; We had a charming time poking



<P>about the ruins, the vaults where the monster tun is, and the



<P>beautiful gardens made by the elector long ago for his English



<P>wife.&nbsp; I liked the great terrace best, for the view was divine,



<P>so while the rest went to see the rooms inside, I sat there trying



<P>to sketch the gray stone lion's head on the wall, with scarlet



<P>woodbine sprays hanging round it.&nbsp; I felt as if I'd got into a



<P>romance, sitting there, watching the Meckar rolling through the



<P>valley, listening to the music of the Austrian band below, and



<P>waiting for my lover, like a real storybook girl.&nbsp; I had a feeling



<P>that something was going to happen and I was ready for it.&nbsp; I



<P>didn't feel blushy or quakey, but quite cool and only a little



<P>excited.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>By-and-by I heard Fred's voice, and then he came hurrying



<P>through the great arch to find me.&nbsp; He looked so troubled that

I



<P>forgot all about myself, and asked what the matter was.&nbsp; He said



<P>he'd just got a letter begging him to come home, for Frank was



<P>very ill.&nbsp; So he was going at once on the night train and only



<P>had time to say good-by.&nbsp; I was very sorry for him, and disappointed



<P>for myself, but only for a minute because he said, as he shook hands,



<P>and said it in a way that I could not mistake,&nbsp; "I shall soon come

back,



<P>you won't forget me, Amy?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I didn't promise, but I looked at him, and he seemed satisfied,



<P>and there was no time for anything but messages and good-byes,



<P>for he was off in an hour, and we all miss him very much.



<P>I know he wanted to speak, but I think, from something he once



<P>hinted, that he had promised his father not to do anything of



<P>the sort yet a while, for is is a rash boy, and the old gentleman



<P>dreads a foreign daughter-in-law.&nbsp; We shall soon meet in



<P>Rome, and then, if I don't change my mind, I'll say "Yes, thank



<P>you," when he says "Will you, please?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Of course this is all very private, but I wished you to



<P>know what was going on.&nbsp; Don't be anxious about me, remember I



<P>am your `prudent Amy', and be sure I will do nothing rashly.



<P>Send me as much advice as you like.&nbsp; I'll use it if I can.&nbsp;

I



<P>wish I could see you for a good talk, Marmee.&nbsp; Love and trust me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Ever your AMY

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Chester's fair was so very elegant and select that it



<P>was considered a great honor by the young ladies of the neighborhood



<P>to be invited to take a table, and everyone was much interest



<P>in the matter.&nbsp; Amy was asked, but Jo was not, which was



<P>fortunate for all parties, as her elbows were decidedly



<P>akimbo at this period of her life, and it took a good many hard



<P>knocks to teach her how to get on easily.&nbsp; The `haughty, uninteresting



<P>creature' was let severely alone, but Amy's talent and taste were duly



<P>complimented by the offer of the art table, and she exerted herself



<P>to prepare and secure appropriate and valuable contributions to it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Everything went on smoothly till the day before the fair



<P>opened, then there occurred one of the little skirmishes which



<P>it is almost impossible to avoid, when some five-and-twenty



<P>women, old and young, with all their private piques and prejudices,



<P>try to work together.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>May Chester was rather jealous of Amy because the latter



<P>was a greater favorite than herself, and just at this time



<P>several trifling circumstances occurred to increase the feeling.



<P>Amy's dainty pen-and-ink work entirely eclipsed May's painted



<P>vases--that was one thorn.&nbsp; Then the all conquering Tudor had



<P>danced four times with Amy at a late party and only once with



<P>May--that was thorn number two.&nbsp; But the chief grievance that



<P>rankled in her soul, and gave an excuse for her unfriendly conduct,



<P>was a rumor which some obliging gossip had whispered to



<P>her, that the March girls had made fun of her at the Lambs'.



<P>All the blame of this should have fallen upon Jo, for her



<P>naughty imitation had been too lifelike to escape detection,



<P>and the frolicsome Lambs had permitted the joke to escape.&nbsp; No



<P>hint of this had reached the culprits, however, and Amy's dismay



<P>can be imagined, when, the very evening before the fair, as she



<P>was putting the last touches to her pretty table, Mrs. Chester,



<P>who, of course, resented the supposed ridicule of her daughter,



<P>said, in a bland tone, but with a cold look...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I find, dear, that there is some feeling among the young



<P>ladies about my giving this table to anyone but my girls.&nbsp; As



<P>this is the most prominent, and some say the most attractive



<P>table of all, and they are the chief getters-up of the fair, it



<P>is thought best for them to take this place.&nbsp; I'm sorry, but I



<P>know you are too sincerely interested in the cause to mind a



<P>little personal disappointment, and you shall have another table



<P>if you like."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Chester fancied beforehand that it would be easy to



<P>deliver this little speech, but when the time came, she found



<P>it rather difficult to utter it naturally, with Amy's unsuspicious



<P>eyes looking straight at her full of surprise and trouble.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Amy felt that there was something behind this, but would



<P>not guess what, and said quietly, feeling hurt, and showing that



<P>she did, "Perhaps you had rather I took no table at all?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now, my dear, don't have any ill feeling, I beg.&nbsp; It's



<P>merely a matter of expediency, you see, my girls will naturally



<P>take the lead, and this table is considered their proper place.



<P>I think it very appropriate to you, and feel very grateful for



<P>your efforts to make it so pretty, but we must give up our private



<P>wishes, of course, and I will see that you have a good place



<P>elsewhere.&nbsp; Wouldn't you like the flower table?&nbsp; The little

girls



<P>undertook it, but they are discouraged.&nbsp; You could make a charming



<P>thing of it, and the flower table is always attractive you know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Especially to gentlemen," added May, with a look which enlightened



<P>Amy as to one cause of her sudden fall from favor.&nbsp; She colored



<P>angrily, but took no other notice of that girlish sarcasm,



<P>and answered with unexpected amiability...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It shall be as you please, Mrs. Chester.&nbsp; I'll give up my



<P>place here at once, and attend to the flowers, if you like."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You can put your own things on your own table, if you



<P>prefer," began May, feeling a little conscience-stricken, as she



<P>looked at the pretty racks, the painted shells, and quaint



<P>illuminations Amy had so carefully made and so gracefully arranged.



<P>She meant it kindly, but Amy mistook her meaning, and said quickly .&nbsp;

..

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, certainly, if they are in your way," and sweeping her



<P>contributions into her apron, pell-mell, she walked off, feeling



<P>that herself and her works of art had been insulted past forgiveness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now she's mad.&nbsp; Oh, dear, I wish I hadn't asked you to speak,&nbsp;

Mama,"



<P>said May, looking disconsolately at the empty spaces on her table.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Girls' quarrels are soon over," returned her mother, feeling



<P>a trifle ashamed of her own part in this one, as well she might.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The little girls hailed Amy and her treasures with delight,



<P>which cordial reception somewhat soothed her perturbed spirit, and



<P>she fell to work, determined to succeed florally, if she could not



<P>artistically.&nbsp; But everything seemed against her.&nbsp; It was

late, and



<P>she was tired.&nbsp; Everyone was too busy with their own affairs to

help



<P>her, and the little girls were only hindrances, for the dears fussed



<P>and chattered like so many magpies, making a great deal of confusion



<P>in their artless efforts to preserve the most perfect order.&nbsp; The



<P>evergreen arch wouldn't stay firm after she got it up, but wiggled



<P>and threatened to tumble down on her head when the hanging baskets



<P>were filled.&nbsp; Her best tile got a splash of water, which left a

sephia



<P>tear on the Cupid's cheek.&nbsp; She bruised her hands with hammering,

and



<P>got cold working in a draft, which last affliction filled her with



<P>apprehensions for the morrow.&nbsp; Any girl reader who has suffered

like



<P>afflictions will sympathize with poor Amy and wish her well through



<P>her task.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was great indignation at home when she told her story



<P>that evening.&nbsp; Her mother said it was a shame, but told her she



<P>had done right.&nbsp; Beth declared she wouldn't go to the fair at all,



<P>and Jo demanded why she didn't take all her pretty things and leave



<P>those mean people to get on without her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Because they are mean is no reason why i should be.&nbsp; I hate



<P>such things, and though I think I've a right to be hurt, I don't



<P>intend to show it.&nbsp; They will feel that more than angry speeches



<P>or huffy actions, won't they, Marmee?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's the right spirit, my dear.&nbsp; A kiss for a blow is always



<P>best, though it's not very easy to give it sometimes," said her



<P>mother, with the air of one who had learned the difference between



<P>preaching and practicing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In spite of various very natural temptations to resent and



<P>retaliate, Amy adhered to her resolution all the next day, bent



<P>on conquering her enemy by kindness.&nbsp; She began well, thanks to

a



<P>silent reminder that came to her unexpectedly, but most opportunely.



<P>As she arranged her table that morning, while the little girls were



<P>in the anteroom filling the baskets, she took up her pet production,



<P>a little book, the antique cover of which her father had found among



<P>his treasures, and in which on leaves of vellum she had beautifully



<P>illuminated different texts.&nbsp; As she turned the pages rich in dainty



<P>devices with very pardonable pride, her eye fell upon one verse that



<P>made her stop and think.&nbsp; Framed in a brilliant scrollwork of scarlet,



<P>blue and gold, with little spirits of good will helping one another



<P>up and down among the thorns and flowers, were the words, "Thou shalt



<P>love thy neighbor as thyself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I ought, but I don't," thought Amy, as her eye went from the



<P>bright page to May's discontented face behind the big vases, that



<P>could not hide the vacancies her pretty work had once filled.&nbsp;

Amy



<P>stood a minute, turning the leaves in her hand, reading on each some



<P>sweet rebuke for all heartburnings and uncharitableness of spirit.



<P>Many wise and true sermons are preached us every day by unconscious



<P>ministers in street, school, office, or home.&nbsp; Even a fair table



<P>may become a pulpit, if it can offer the good and helpful words



<P>which are never out of season.&nbsp; Amy's conscience preached her a



<P>little sermon from that text, then and there, and she did what many



<P>of us do not always do, took the sermon to heart, and straightway



<P>put it in practice.



<P>A group of girls were standing about May's table, admiring



<P>the pretty things, and talking over the change of saleswomen.&nbsp;

They



<P>dropped their voices, but Amy knew they were speaking of her, hearing



<P>one side of the story and judging accordingly.&nbsp; It was not pleasant,



<P>but a better spirit had come over her, and presently a chance



<P>offered for proving it.&nbsp; She heard May say sorrowfully...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's too bad, for there is no time to make other things, and



<P>I don't want to fill up with odds and ends.&nbsp; The table was just



<P>complete then.&nbsp; Now it's spoiled."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I dare say she'd put them back if you asked her," suggested



<P>someone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How could I after all the fuss?" began May, but she did not



<P>finish, for Amy's voice came across the hall, saying pleasantly...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You may have them, and welcome, without asking, if you want



<P>them.&nbsp; I was just thinking I'd offer to put them back, for they



<P>belong to your table rather than mine.&nbsp; Here they are, please take



<P>them, and forgive me if I was hasty in carrying them away last night."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As she spoke, Amy returned her contribution, with a nod and a



<P>smile, and hurried away again, feeling that it was easier to do a



<P>friendly thing than it was to stay and be thanked for it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now, I call that lovely of her, don't you?" cried one girl.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>May's answer was inaudible, but another young lady, whose



<P>temper was evidently a little soured by making lemonade, added,



<P>with a disagreeable laugh, "Very lovely, for she knew she wouldn't



<P>sell them at her own table."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, that was hard.&nbsp; When we make little sacrifices we like



<P>to have them appreciated, at least, and for a minute Amy was sorry



<P>she had done it, feeling that virtue was not always its won reward.



<P>But it is, as she presently discovered, for her spirits began to



<P>rise, and her table to blossom under her skillful hands, the girls



<P>were very kind, and that one little act seemed to have cleared the



<P>atmosphere amazingly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was a very long day and a hard one for Amy, as she sat behind



<P>her table, often quite alone, for the little girls deserted



<P>very soon.&nbsp; Few cared to buy flowers in summer, and her bouquets



<P>began to droop long before night.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The art table was the most attractive in the room.&nbsp; There was



<P>a crowd about it all day long, and the tenders were constantly flying



<P>to and fro with important faces and rattling money boxes.&nbsp; Amy



<P>often looked wistfully across, longing to be there, where she felt



<P>at home and happy, instead of in a corner with nothing to do.&nbsp;

It



<P>might seem no hardship to some of us, but to a pretty, blithe young



<P>girl, it was not only tedious, but very trying, and the thought of



<P>Laurie and his friends made it a real martyrdom.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She did not go home till night, and then she looked so pale



<P>and quiet that they knew the day had been a hard one, though she



<P>made no complaint, and did not even tell what she had done.&nbsp; Her



<P>mother gave her an extra cordial cup of tea.&nbsp; Beth helped her dress,



<P>and made a charming little wreath for her hair, while Jo astonished



<P>her family by getting herself up with unusual care, and hinting



<P>darkly that the tables were about to be turned.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't do anything rude, pray Jo.&nbsp; I won't have any fuss made,



<P>so let it all pass and behave yourself," begged Amy, as she departed



<P>early, hoping to find a reinforcement of flowers to refresh her poor



<P>little table.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I merely intend to make myself entrancingly agreeable to ever



<P>one I know, and to keep them in your corner as long as possible.



<P>Teddy and his boys will lend a hand, and we'll have a good time yet."



<P>returned Jo, leaning over the gate to watch for Laurie.&nbsp; Presently



<P>the familiar tramp was heard in the dusk, and she ran out to meet him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Is that my boy?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"As sure as this is my girl!"&nbsp; And Laurie tucked her hand under



<P>his arm with the air of a man whose every wish was gratified.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, teddy, such doings!" And Jo told Amy's wrongs with sisterly zeal.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A flock of our fellows are going to drive over by-and-by, and



<P>I'll be hanged if I don't make them buy every flower she's got, and



<P>camp down before her table afterward," said Laurie, espousing her



<P>cause with warmth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The flowers are not at all nice, Amy says, and the fresh ones



<P>may not arrive in time.&nbsp; I don't wish to be unjust or suspicious,

but



<P>I shouldn't wonder if they never came at all.&nbsp; When people do one



<P>mean thing they are very likely to do another," observed Jo in a



<P>disgusted tone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Didn't Hayes give you the best out of our gardens? I told him to."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I didn't know that, he forgot, I suppose, and, as your grandpa was



<P>poorly, I didn't like to worry him by asking, though I did want some."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now, Jo, how could you think there was any need of asking?



<P>They are just as much yours as mine.&nbsp; Don't we always go halves



<P>in everything?" began Laurie, in the tone that always made Jo



<P>turn thorny.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Gracious, I hope not!&nbsp; Half of some of your things wouldn't



<P>suit me at all.&nbsp; But we mustn't stand philandering here.&nbsp;

I've got



<P>to help Amy, so you go and make yourself splendid, and if you'll



<P>be so very kind as to let Hayes take a few nice flowers up to the



<P>Hall, I'll bless you forever."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Couldn't you do it now?" asked Laurie, so suggestively that



<P>Jo shut the gate in his face with inhospitable haste, and called



<P>through the bars, "Go away, Teddy, I'm busy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Thanks to the conspirators, the tables were turned that night,



<P>for Hayes sent up a wilderness of flowers, with a loverly basket



<P>arranged in his best manner for a centerpiece.&nbsp; Then the March

family



<P>turned out en masse, and Jo exerted herself to some purpose, for



<P>people not only came, but stayed, laughing at her nonsense, admiring



<P>Amy's taste, and apparently enjoying themselves very much.&nbsp; Laurie



<P>and his friends gallantly threw themselves into the breach, bought



<P>up the bouquets, encamped before the table, and made that corner



<P>the liveliest spot in the room.&nbsp; Amy was in her element now, and

out



<P>of gratitude, if nothing more, was as spritely and gracious as possible,



<P>coming to the conclusion, about that time, that virtue was



<P>it's own reward, after all.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo behaved herself with exemplary propriety, and when Amy was



<P>happily surrounded by her guard of honor, Jo circulated about the



<P>hall, picking up various bits of gossip, which enlightened her upon



<P>the subject of the Chester change of base.&nbsp; She reproached herself



<P>for her share of the ill feeling and resolved to exonerate Amy as



<P>soon as possible.&nbsp; She also discovered what Amy had done about

the



<P>things in the morning, and considered her a model of magnanimity.&nbsp;

As



<P>she passed the art table, she glanced over it for her sister's



<P>things, but saw no sign of them.&nbsp; "Tucked away out of sight, I

dare



<P>say," thought Jo, who could forgiver her own wrongs, but hotly resented



<P>any insult offered her family.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Good evening, Miss Jo.&nbsp; How does Amy get on?" asked May with



<P>a conciliatory air, for she wanted to show that she also could be



<P>generous.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She has sold everything she had that was worth selling, and



<P>now she is enjoying herself.&nbsp; The flower table is always attractive,



<P>you know, `especially to gentlemen'."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo couldn't resist giving that little slap, but May took it



<P>so meekly she regretted it a minute after, and fell to praising



<P>the great vases, which still remained unsold.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Is Amy's illumination anywhere about" I took a fancy to



<P>buy that for Father," said Jo, very anxious to learn the fate of



<P>her sister's work.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Everything of Amy's sold long ago.&nbsp; I took care that the



<P>right people saw them, and they made a nice little sum of money



<P>for us," returned May, who had overcome sundry small temptations,



<P>as well as Amy had, that day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Much gratified, Jo rushed back to tell the good news, and



<P>Amy looked both touched and surprised by the report of May's



<P>word and manner.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now, gentlemen, I want you to go and do your duty by the



<P>other tables as generously as you have by mine, especially the



<P>art table," she said, ordering out `Teddy's own', as the girls



<P>called the college friends.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"`Charge, Chester, charge!' is the motto for that table, but



<P>do your duty like men, and you'll get your money's worth of art



<P>in every sense of the word," said the irrepressible Jo, as the



<P>devoted phalanx prepared to take the field.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To hear is to obey, but March is fairer far than May," said



<P>little Parker, making a frantic effort to be both witty and tender,



<P>and getting promptly quenched by Laurie, who said...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very well, my son, for a small boy!" and walked him off, with



<P>a paternal pat on the head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Buy the vases," whispered Amy to Laurie, as a final heaping



<P>of coals of fire on her enemy's head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To May's great delight, Mr. Laurence not only bought the vases,



<P>but pervaded the hall with one under each arm.&nbsp; The other gentlemen



<P>speculated with equal rashness in all sorts of frail trifles, and



<P>wandered helplessly about afterward, burdened with wax flowers,



<P>painted fans, filigree portfolios, and other useful and appropriate



<P>purchases.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Aunt Carrol was there, heard the story, looked pleased, and



<P>said something to Mrs. March in a corner, which made the latter



<P>lady beam with satisfaction, and watch Amy with a face full of



<P>mingled pride and anxiety, though she did not betray the cause



<P>of her pleasure till several days later.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The fair was pronounced a success, and when May bade Amy



<P>goodnight, she did not gush as usual, but gave her an affectionate



<P>kiss, and a look which said `forgive and forget'.&nbsp; That satisfied



<P>Amy, and when she got home she found the vases paraded on



<P>the parlor chimney piece with a great bouquet in each.&nbsp; "The



<P>reward of merit for a magnanimous March," as Laurie announced



<P>with a flourish.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You've a deal more principle and generosity and nobleness



<P>of character than I ever gave you credit for, Amy.&nbsp; You've behaved



<P>sweetly, and I respect you with all my heart," said Jo



<P>warmly, as they brushed their hair together late that night.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, we all do, and love her for being so ready to forgive.



<P>It must have been dreadfully hard, after working so long and setting



<P>your heart on selling your own pretty things.&nbsp; I don't believe

I could



<P>have done it as kindly as you did," added Beth from her pillow.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, girls, you needn't praise me so.&nbsp; I only did as I'd



<P>be done by.&nbsp; You laugh at me when I say I want to be a lady, but



<P>I mean a true gentlewoman in mind and manners, and I try to do



<P>it as far as I know how.&nbsp; I can't explain exactly, but I want to



<P>be above the little meannesses and follies and faults that spoil



<P>so many women.&nbsp; I'm far from it now, but I do my best, and hope

in



<P>time to be what Mother is."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy spoke earnestly, and Jo said, with a cordial hug, "I



<P>understand now what you mean, and I'll never laugh at you again.



<P>You are getting on faster than you think, and I'll take lessons



<P>of you in true politeness, for you've learned the secret, I believe.



<P>Try away, deary, you'll get your reward some day, and



<P>no one will be more delighted than I shall."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A week later Amy did get her reward, and poor Jo found it



<P>hard to be delighted.&nbsp; A letter came from Aunt Carrol, and Mrs.



<P>March's face was illuminated to such a degree when she read it



<P>that Jo and Beth, who were with her, demanded what the glad



<P>tiding were.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Aunt Carrol is going abroad next month, and wants..."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Me to go with her!" burst in Jo, flying out of her chair



<P>in an uncontrollable rapture.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, dear, not you.&nbsp; It's Amy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, Mother!&nbsp; She's too young, it's my turn first.&nbsp; I've



<P>wanted it so long.&nbsp; It would do me so much good, and be so altogether



<P>splendid.&nbsp; I must go!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm afraid it's impossible, Jo.&nbsp; Aunt says Amy, decidedly,



<P>and it is not for us to dictate when she offers such a favor."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's always so.&nbsp; Amy has all the fun and I have all the work.



<P>It isn't fair, oh, it isn't fair!" cried Jo passionately.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm afraid it's partly your own fault, dear.&nbsp; When Aunt spoke



<P>to me the other day, she regretted your blunt manners and too



<P>independent spirit, and here she writes, as if quoting something you



<P>had said--`I planned at first to ask Jo, but as `favors burden her',



<P>and she `hates French', I think I won't venture to invite her.&nbsp;

Amy



<P>is more docile, will make a good companion for Flo, and receive



<P>gratefully any help the trip may give her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, my tongue, my abominable tongue!&nbsp; Why can't I learn to



<P>keep it quiet?' groaned Jo, remembering words which had been



<P>her undoing.&nbsp; When she had heard the explanation of the quoted



<P>phrases, Mrs. March said sorrowfully...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wish you could have gone, but there is no hope of it this



<P>time, so try to bear it cheerfully, and don't sadden Amy's pleasure



<P>by reproaches or regrets."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll try," said Jo, winking hard as she knelt down to pick



<P>up the basket she had joyfully upset.&nbsp; "I'll take a leaf out of



<P>her book, and try not only to seem glad, but to be so, and not



<P>grudge her one minute of happiness.&nbsp; But it won't be easy, for



<P>it is a dreadful disappointment."&nbsp; And poor Jo bedewed the little



<P>fat pincushion she held with several very bitter tears.



<P>"Jo, dear, I'm very selfish, but I couldn't spare you, and



<P>I'm glad you are not going quite yet," whispered Beth, embracing



<P>her, basket and all, with such a clinging touch and loving face



<P>that Jo felt comforted in spite of the sharp regret that made her



<P>want to box her own ears, and humbly beg Aunt Carrol to burden



<P>her with this favor, and see how gratefully she would bear it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>By the time Amy came in, Jo was able to take her part in



<P>the family jubilation, not quite as heartily as usual, perhaps,



<P>but without repinings at Amy's good fortune.&nbsp; The young lady



<P>herself received the news as tidings of great joy, went about



<P>in a solemn sort of rapture, and began to sort her colors and



<P>pack her pencils that evening, leaving such trifles as clothes,



<P>money, and passports to those less absorbed in visions of art



<P>than herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It isn't a mere pleasure trip to me, girls," she said impressively,



<P>as she scraped her best palette.&nbsp; "It will decide my career,



<P>for if I have any genius, I shall find it out in Rome,



<P>and will do something to prove it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Suppose you haven't?" said Jo, sewing away, with red eyes,



<P>at the new collars which were to be handed over to Amy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then I shall come home and teach drawing for my living,"



<P>replied the aspirant for fame, with philosophic composure.



<P>But she made a wry face at the prospect, and scratched away



<P>at her palette as if bent on vigorous measures before she



<P>gave up her hopes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, you won't.&nbsp; You hate hard work, and you'll marry some



<P>rich man, and come home to sit in the lap of luxury all your



<P>days," said Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your predictions sometimes come to pass, but I don't believe



<P>that one will.&nbsp; I'm sure I wish it would, for if I can't be



<P>an artist myself, I should like to be able to help those who are,"



<P>said Amy, smiling, as if the part of Lady Bountiful would suit



<P>her better than that of a poor drawing teacher.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hum!" said Jo, with a sigh.&nbsp; "If you wish it you'll have it,



<P>for your wishes are always granted--mine never."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Would you like to go?" asked Amy, thoughtfully patting her



<P>nose with her knife.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Rather!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, in a year or two I'll send for you, and we'll dig in



<P>the Forum for relics, and carry out all the plans we've made so



<P>many times."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you.&nbsp; I'll remind you of your promise when that joyful



<P>day comes, if it ever does," returned Jo, accepting the vague but



<P>magnificent offer as gratefully as she could.



<P>"There was not much time for preparation, and the house was



<P>in a ferment till Amy was off.&nbsp; Jo bore up very well till the



<P>last flutter of blue ribbon vanished, when she retired to her



<P>refuge, the garret, and cried till she couldn't cry any more.



<P>Amy likewise bore up stoutly till the steamer sailed.&nbsp; Then



<P>just as the gangway was about to be withdrawn, it suddenly came



<P>over her that a whole ocean was soon to roll between her and



<P>those who loved her best, and she clung to Laurie, the last



<P>lingerer, saying with a sob...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, take care of them for me, and if anything should



<P>happen...&nbsp; "

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I will, dear, I will, and if anything happens, I'll come



<P>and comfort you," whispered Laurie, little dreaming that he would



<P>be called upon to keep his word.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So Amy sailed away to find the Old World, which is always



<P>new and beautiful to young eyes, while her father and friend



<P>watched her from the shore, fervently hoping that none but gentle



<P>fortunes would befall the happy-hearted girl, who waved her hand



<P>to them till they could see nothing but the summer sunshine dazzling



<P>on the sea.

LITTLE WOMEN PART 2</FONT></B>



<P><B>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In order that we may start afresh and go to Meg's wedding



<P>with free minds, it will be well to begin with a little gossip



<P>about the Marches.&nbsp; And here let me premise that if any of the



<P>elders think there is too much `lovering' in the story, as I fear



<P>they may (I'm not afraid the young folks will make that objection),



<P>I can only say with Mrs. March, "What can you expect when I have



<P>four gay girls in the house, and a dashing young neighbor over the



<P>way?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The three years that have passed have brought but few changes



<P>to the quiet family.&nbsp; The war is over, and Mr. March safely at



<P>home, busy with his books and the small parish which found in him



<P>a minister by nature as by grace, a quiet, studious man, rich in



<P>the wisdom that is better than learning, the charity which calls



<P>all mankind `brother', the piety that blossoms into character,



<P>making it august and lovely.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These attributes, in spite of poverty and the strict integrity



<P>which shut him out from the more worldly successes, attracted to



<P>him many admirable persons, as naturally as sweet herbs draw bees,



<P>and as naturally he gave them the honey into which fifty years of



<P>hard experience had distilled no bitter drop.&nbsp; Earnest young men



<P>found the gray-headed scholar as young at heart as they, thoughtful



<P>or troubled women instinctively brought their doubts to him, sure



<P>of finding the gentlest sympathy, the wisest counsel.&nbsp; Sinners

told



<P>their sins to the pure-hearted old man and were both rebuked and



<P>saved.&nbsp; Gifted men found a companion in him.&nbsp; Ambitious men

caught



<P>glimpses of nobler ambitions than their own, and even worldlings



<P>confessed that his beliefs were beautiful and true, although `they



<P>wouldn't pay'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To outsiders the five energetic women seemed to rule the house,



<P>and so they did in many things, but the quiet scholar, sitting among



<P>his books, was still the head of the family, the household conscience,



<P>anchor, and comforter, for to him the busy, anxious women always



<P>turned in troublous times, finding him, in the truest sense of those



<P>sacred words, husband and father.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The girls gave their hearts into their mother's keeping, their



<P>souls into their father's, and to both parents, who lived and labored



<P>so faithfully for them, they gave a love that grew with their growth



<P>and bound them tenderly together by the sweetest tie which blesses



<P>life and outlives death.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. March is as brisk and cheery, though rather grayer, than



<P>when we saw her last, and just now so absorbed in Meg's affairs that



<P>the hospitals and homes still full of wounded `boys' and soldiers'



<P>widows, decidedly miss the motherly missionary's visits.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>John Brooke did his duty manfully for a year, got wounded, was



<P>sent home, and not allowed to return.&nbsp; He received no stars or

bars,



<P>but he deserved them, for he cheerfully risked all he had, and life



<P>and love are very precious when both are in full bloom.&nbsp; Perfectly



<P>resigned to his discharge, he devoted himself to getting well,



<P>preparing for business, and earning a home for Meg.&nbsp; With the good



<P>sense and sturdy independence that characterized him, he refused



<P>Mr. Laurence's more generous offers, and accepted the place of



<P>bookkeeper, feeling better satisfied to begin with an honestly earned



<P>salary than by running any risks with borrowed money.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg had spent the time in working as well as waiting, growing



<P>womanly in character, wise in housewifely arts, and prettier than



<P>ever, for love is a great beautifier.&nbsp; She had her girlish ambitions



<P>and hopes, and felt some disappointment at the humble way in which



<P>the new life must begin.&nbsp; Ned Moffat had just married Sallie Gardiner,



<P>and Meg couldn't help contrasting their fine house and carriage,



<P>many gifts, and splendid outfit with her own, and secretly wishing



<P>she could have the same.&nbsp; But somehow envy and discontent soon



<P>vanished when she thought of all the patient love and labor John had



<P>put into the little home awaiting her, and when they sat together in



<P>the twilight, talking over their small plans, the future always grew



<P>so beautiful and bright that she forgot Sallie's splendor and felt



<P>herself the richest, happiest girl in Christendom.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo never went back to Aunt March, for the old lady took such



<P>a fancy to AMy that she bribed her with the offer of drawing lessons



<P>from one of the best teachers going, and for the sake of this



<P>advantage, Amy would have served a far harder mistress.&nbsp; So she

gave her



<P>mornings to duty, her afternoons to pleasure, and prospered finely.



<P>Jo meantime devoted herself to literature and Beth, who remained



<P>delicate long after the fever was a thing of the past.&nbsp; Not an



<P>invalid exactly, but never again the rosy, healthy creature she had



<P>been, yet always hopeful, happy, and serene, and busy with the quiet



<P>duties she loved, everyone's friend, and an angel in the house, long



<P>before those who loved her most had learned to know it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As long as THE SPREAD EAGLE paid her a dollar a column for her



<P>`rubbish', as she called it, Jo felt herself a woman of means, and



<P>spun her little romances diligently.&nbsp; But great plans fermented

in



<P>her busy brain and ambitious mind, and the old tin kitchen in the



<P>garret held a slowly increasing pile of blotted manuscript, which



<P>was one day to place the name of March upon the roll of fame.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie, having dutifully gone to college to please his grandfather,



<P>was now getting through it in the easiest possible manner



<P>to please himself.&nbsp; A universal favorite, thanks to money, manners,



<P>much talent, and the kindest heart that ever got its owner into



<P>scrapes by trying to get other people out of them, he stood in



<P>great danger of being spoiled, and probably would have been, like



<P>many another promising boy, if he had not possessed a talisman



<P>against evil in the memory of the kind old man who was bound up in



<P>his success, the motherly friend who watched over him as if he were



<P>her son, and last, but not least by any means, the knowledge that



<P>four innocent girls loved, admired, and believed in him with all



<P>their hearts.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Being only `a glorious human boy', of course he frolicked and



<P>flirted, grew dandified, aquatic, sentimental, or gymnastic, as



<P>college fashions ordained, hazed and was hazed, talked slang, and



<P>more than once came perilously near suspension and expulsion.&nbsp;

But



<P>as high spirits and the love of fun were the causes of these pranks,



<P>he always managed to save himself by frank confession, honorable



<P>atonement, or the irresistible power of persuasion which he possessed



<P>in perfection.&nbsp; In fact, he rather prided himself on his narrow



<P>escapes, and liked to thrill the girls with graphic accounts of his



<P>triumphs over wrathful tutors, dignified professors, and vanquished



<P>enemies.&nbsp; The `men of my class', were heroes in the eyes of the

girls,



<P>who never wearied of the exploits of `our fellows', and were frequently



<P>allowed to bask in the smiles of these great creatures, when Laurie



<P>brought them home with him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy especially enjoyed this high honor, and became quite a belle



<P>among them, for her ladyship early felt and learned to use the gift



<P>of fascination with which she was endowed.&nbsp; Meg was too much absorbed



<P>in her private and particular John to care for any other lords of



<P>creation, and Beth too shy to do more than peep at them and wonder



<P>how Amy dared to order them about so, but Jo felt quite in her own



<P>element, and found it very difficult to refrain from imitating the



<P>gentlemanly attitudes, phrases, and feats, which seemed more natural



<P>to her than the decorums prescribed for young ladies.&nbsp; They all

liked



<P>Jo immensely, but never fell in love with her, though very few escaped



<P>without paying the tribute of a sentimental sigh or two at Amy's shrine.



<P>And speaking of sentiment brings us very naturally to the `Dovecote'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That was the name of the little brown house Mr. Brooke had prepared



<P>for Meg's first home.&nbsp; Laurie had christened it, saying it was



<P>highly appropriate to the gentle lovers who `went on together like a



<P>pair of turtledoves, with first a bill and then a coo'.&nbsp; It was

a



<P>tiny house, with a little garden behind and a lawn about as big as a



<P>pocket handkerchief in the front.&nbsp; Here Meg meant to have a fountain,



<P>shrubbery, and a profusion of lovely flowers, though just at present



<P>the fountain was represented by a weather-beaten urn, very like a



<P>dilapidated slopbowl, the shrubbery consisted of several young larches,



<P>undecided whether to live or die, and the profusion of flowers was



<P>merely hinted by regiments of sticks to show where seeds were planted.



<P>But inside, it was altogether charming, and the happy bride saw no



<P>fault from garret to cellar.&nbsp; To be sure, the hall was so narrow

it



<P>was fortunate that they had no piano, for one never could have been



<P>got in whole, the dining room was so small that six people were a



<P>tight fit, and the kitchen stairs seemed built for the express



<P>purpose of precipitating both servants and china pell-mell into the



<P>coalbin.&nbsp; But once get used to these slight blemishes and nothing



<P>could be more complete, for good sense and good taste had presided



<P>over the furnishing, and the result was highly satisfactory.&nbsp; There



<P>were no marble-topped tables, long mirrors, or lace curtains in the



<P>little parlor, but simple furniture, plenty of books, a fine picture



<P>or two, a stand of flowers in the bay window, and, scattered all



<P>about, the pretty gifts which came from friendly hands and were the



<P>fairer for the loving messages they brought.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I don't think the Parian Psyche Laurie gave lost any of its



<P>beauty because John put up the bracket it stood upon, that any



<P>upholsterer could have draped the plain muslin curtains more



<P>gracefully than Amy's artistic hand, or that any store-room was ever



<P>better provided with good wishes, merry words, and happy hopes



<P>than that in which Jo and her mother put away Meg's few boxes,



<P>barrels, and bundles, and I am morally certain that the spandy new



<P>kitchen never could have looked so cozy and neat if Hannah had not



<P>arranged every pot and pan a dozen times over, and laid the fire



<P>all ready for lighting the minute `Mis.&nbsp; Brooke came home'.&nbsp;

I also



<P>doubt if any young matron ever began life with so rich a supply of



<P>dusters, holders, and piece bags, for Beth made enough to last till



<P>the silver wedding came round, and invented three different kinds



<P>of dishcloths for the express service of the bridal china.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>People who hire all these things done for them never know



<P>what they lose, for the homeliest tasks get beautified if loving



<P>hands do them, and Meg found so many proofs of this that everything



<P>in her small nest, from the kitchen roller to the silver vase on



<P>her parlor table, was eloquent of home love and tender forethought.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>What happy times they had planning together, what solemn



<P>shopping excursions, what funny mistakes they made, and what



<P>shouts of laughter arose over Laurie's ridiculous bargains.&nbsp; In



<P>his love of jokes, this young gentleman, though nearly through



<P>college, was a much of a boy as ever.&nbsp; His last whim had been to



<P>bring with him on his weekly visits some new, useful, and ingenious



<P>article for the young housekeeper.&nbsp; Now a bag of remarkable



<P>clothespins, next, a wonderful nutmeg grater which fell to pieces at

the



<P>first trial, a knife cleaner that spoiled all the knives, or a



<P>sweeper that picked the nap neatly off the carpet and left the dirt,



<P>labor-saving soap that took the skin off one's hands, infallible



<P>cements which stuck firmly to nothing but the fingers of the



<P>deluded buyer, and every kind of tinware, from a toy savings bank for



<P>odd pennies, to a wonderful boiler which would wash articles in its



<P>own steam with every prospect of exploding in the process.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In vain Meg begged him to stop.&nbsp; John laughed at him, and Jo called



<P>him `Mr. Toodles'.&nbsp; He was possessed with a mania for patronizing



<P>Yankee ingenuity, and seeing his friends fitly furnished forth.



<P>So each week beheld some fresh absurdity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Everything was done at last, even to Amy's arranging different



<P>colored soaps to match the different colored rooms, and Beth's



<P>setting the table for the first meal.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Are you satisfied?&nbsp; Does it seem like home, and do you feel



<P>as if you should be happy here?" asked Mrs. March, as she and her



<P>daughter went through the new kingdom arm in arm, for just then



<P>they seemed to cling together more tenderly than ever.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, Mother, perfectly satisfied, thanks to you all, and so



<P>happy that I can't talk about it," with a look that was far better



<P>than words.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If she only had a servant or two it would be all right," said Amy,



<P>coming out of the parlor, where she had been trying to decide whether



<P>the bronze Mercury looked best on the whatnot or the mantlepiece.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mother and I have talked that over, and I have made up my



<P>mind to try her way first.&nbsp; There will be so little to do that

with



<P>Lotty to run my errands and help me here and there, I shall only



<P>have enough work to keep me from getting lazy or homesick," answered



<P>Meg tranquilly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sallie Moffat has four," began Amy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If Meg had four, the house wouldn't hold them, and master and



<P>missis would have to camp in the garden," broke in Jo, who, enveloped



<P>in a big blue pinafore, was giving the last polish to the door handles.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sallie isn't a poor man's wife, and many maids are in keeping



<P>with her fine establishment.&nbsp; Meg and John begin humbly, but I

have



<P>a feeling that there will be quite as much happiness in the little



<P>house as in the big one.&nbsp; It's a great mistake for young girls

like



<P>Meg to leave themselves nothing to do but dress, give orders, and



<P>gossip.&nbsp; When I was first married, I used to long for my new clothes



<P>to wear out or get torn, so that i might have the pleasure of mending



<P>them, for I got heartily sick of doing fancywork and tending my



<P>pocket handkerchief."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why didn't you go into the kitchen and make messes, as Sallie



<P>says she does to amuse herself, though they never turn out well and



<P>the servants laugh at her," said Meg.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I did after a while, not to `mess' but to learn of Hannah how



<P>things should be done, that my servants need not laugh at me.&nbsp;

It



<P>was play then, but there came a time when I was truly grateful that



<P>I not only possessed the will but the power to cook wholesome food



<P>for my little girls, and help myself when I could no longer afford



<P>to hire help.&nbsp; You begin at the other end, Meg, dear, but the lessons



<P>you learn now will be of use to you by-and-by when John is a richer



<P>man, for the mistress of a house, however splendid, should know how



<P>work ought to be done, if she wishes to be well and honestly served."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, Mother, I'm sure of that," said Meg, listening respectfully



<P>to the little lecture, for the best of women will hold forth



<P>upon the all absorbing subject of house keeping.&nbsp; "Do you know

I



<P>like this room most of all in my baby house," added Meg, a minute



<P>after, as they went upstairs and she looked into her well-stored



<P>linen closet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Beth was there, laying the snowy piles smoothly on the shelves



<P>and exulting over the goodly array.&nbsp; All three laughed as Meg spoke,



<P>for that linen closet was a joke.&nbsp; You see, having said that if

Meg



<P>married `that Brooke' she shouldn't have a cent of her money, Aunt



<P>March was rather in a quandary when time had appeased her wrath and



<P>made her repent her vow.&nbsp; She never broke her word, and was much



<P>exercised in her mind how to get round it, and at last devised a



<P>plan whereby she could satisfy herself.&nbsp; Mrs. Carrol, Florence's



<P>mamma, was ordered to buy, have made, and marked a generous supply



<P>of house and table linen, and send it as her present, all of which



<P>was faithfully done, but the secret leaked out, and was greatly



<P>enjoyed by the family, for Aunt March tried to look utterly



<P>unconscious, and insisted that she could give nothing but the



<P>old-fashioned pearls long promised to the first bride.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's a housewifely taste which I am glad to see.&nbsp; I had a



<P>young friend who set up housekeeping with six sheets, but she had



<P>finger bowls for company and that satisfied her," said Mrs. March,



<P>patting the damask tablecloths, with a truly feminine appreciation



<P>of their fineness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I haven't a single finger bowl, but this is a setout that will



<P>last me all my days, Hannah says."&nbsp; And Meg looked quite contented,



<P>as well she might.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A tall, broad-shouldered young fellow, with a cropped head, a



<P>felt basin of a hat, and a flyaway coat, came tramping down the



<P>road at a great pace, walked over the low fence without stopping to



<P>open the gate, straight up to Mrs. March, with both hands out and



<P>a hearty .&nbsp; ..

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here I am, Mother!&nbsp; Yes, it's all right."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The last words were in answer to the look the elder lady gave



<P>him, a kindly questioning look which the handsome eyes met so



<P>frankly that the little ceremony closed, as usual, with a motherly



<P>kiss.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"For Mrs. John Brooke, with the maker's congratulations and



<P>compliments.&nbsp; Bless you, Beth!&nbsp; What a refreshing spectacle

you



<P>are, Jo.&nbsp; Amy, you are getting altogether too handsome for a



<P>single lady."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As Laurie spoke, he delivered a brown paper parcel to Meg,



<P>pilled Beth's hair ribbon, stared at Jo's bib pinafore, and fell



<P>into an attitude of mock rapture before Amy, then shook hands all



<P>round, and everyone began to talk.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Where is John?" asked Meg anxiously.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Stopped to get the license for tomorrow, ma'am."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Which side won the last match, Teddy?" inquired Jo, who persisted



<P>in feeling an interest in manly sports despite her nineteen years.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ours, of course.&nbsp; Wish you'd been there to see."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How is the lovely Miss Randal?" asked Amy with a significant smile.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"More cruel than ever.&nbsp; Don't you see how I'm pining away?"



<P>And Laurie gave his broad chest a sounding slap and heaved a



<P>melodramatic sigh.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What's the last joke?&nbsp; Undo the bundle and see, Meg," said



<P>Beth, eying the knobby parcel with curiosity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's a useful thing to have in the house in case of fire



<P>or thieves," observed Laurie, as a watchman's rattle appeared,



<P>amid the laughter of the girls.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Any time when John is away and you get frightened, Mrs.



<P>Meg, just swing that out of the front window, and it will rouse



<P>the neighborhood in a jiffy.&nbsp; Nice thing, isn't it?" And Laurie



<P>gave them a sample of its powers that made them cover up their ears.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There's gratitude for you!&nbsp; And speaking of gratitude reminds



<P>me to mention that you may thank Hannah for saving your wedding cake



<P>from destruction.&nbsp; I saw it going into your house as I came by,

and



<P>if she hadn't defended it manfully I'd have had a pick at it, for it



<P>looked like a remarkably plummy one."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wonder if you will ever grow up, Laurie," said Meg in a



<P>matronly tone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm doing my best, ma'am, but can't get much higher, I'm afraid,



<P>as six feet is about all men can do in these degenerate days,"



<P>responded the young gentleman, whose head was about level with the



<P>little chandelier.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I suppose it would be profanation to eat anything in this



<P>spick-and-span bower, so as I'm tremendously hungry,



<P>I propose an adjournment," he added presently.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mother and I are going to wait for John.&nbsp; There are some last



<P>things to settle," said Meg, bustling away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Beth and I are going over to Kitty Bryant's to get more flowers



<P>for tomorrow," added Amy, tying a picturesque hat over her picturesque



<P>curls, and enjoying the effect as much as anybody.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Come, Jo, don't desert a fellow.&nbsp; I'm in such a state of exhaustion



<P>I can't get home without help.&nbsp; Don't take off your apron,



<P>whatever you do, it's peculiarly becoming," said Laurie, as Jo



<P>bestowed his especial aversion in her capacious pocket and offered



<P>her arm to support his feeble steps.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now, Teddy, I want to talk seriously to you about tomorrow,"



<P>began Jo, as they strolled away together.&nbsp; "You must promise to



<P>behave well, and not cut up any pranks, and spoil our plans."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not a prank."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And don't say funny things when we ought to be sober."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I never do.&nbsp; You are the one for that."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And I implore you not to look at me during the ceremony.&nbsp; I



<P>shall certainly laugh if you do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You won't see me, you'll be crying so hard that the thick fog



<P>round you will obscure the prospect."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I never cry unless for some great affliction."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Such as fellows going to college, hey?" cut in Laurie, with



<P>suggestive laugh.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't be a peacock.&nbsp; I only moaned a trifle to keep the girls



<P>company."



<P>"Exactly.&nbsp; I say, Jo, how is Grandpa this week?&nbsp; Pretty amiable?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very.&nbsp; Why, have you got into a scrape and want to know how



<P>he'll take it?" asked Jo rather sharply.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now, Jo, do you think I'd look your mother in the face and say



<P>`All right', if it wasn't?" And Laurie stopped short, with an injured



<P>air.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I don't."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then don't go and be suspicious.&nbsp; I only want some money," said



<P>Laurie, walking on again, appeased by her hearty tone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You spend a great deal, Teddy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Bless you, I don't spend it, it spends itself somehow, and is



<P>gone before I know it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are so generous and kind-hearted that you let people borrow,



<P>and can't say `No' to anyone.&nbsp; We heard about Henshaw and all you

did



<P>for him.&nbsp; If you always spent money in that way, no one would blame



<P>you," said Jo warmly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, he made a mountain out of a molehill.&nbsp; You wouldn't have me



<P>let that fine fellow work himself to death just for want of a little



<P>help, when he is worth a dozen of us lazy chaps, would you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Of course not, but I don't see the use of your having seventeen



<P>waistcoats, endless neckties, and a new hat every time you come home.



<P>I thought you'd got over the dandy period, but every now and then it



<P>breaks out in a new spot.&nbsp; Just now it's the fashion to be hideous,



<P>to make your head look like a scrubbing brush, wear a strait jacket,



<P>orange gloves, and clumping square-toed boots.&nbsp; If it was cheap



<P>ugliness, I'd say nothing, but it costs as much as the other, and I



<P>don't get any satisfaction out of it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie threw back his head, and laughed so heartily at this



<P>attack, that the felt hat fell off, and Jo walked on it, which



<P>insult only afforded him an opportunity for expatiating on the



<P>advantages of a rough-and-ready costume, as he folded up the



<P>maltreated hat, and stuffed it into his pocket.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't lecture any more, there's a good soul!&nbsp; I have enough



<P>all through the week, and like to enjoy myself when I come home.



<P>I'll get myself up regardless of expense tomorrow and be a



<P>satisfaction to my friends."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll leave you in peace if you'll only let your hair grow.



<P>I'm not aristocratic, but I do object to being seen with a person



<P>who looks like a young prize fighter," observed Jo severely.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This unassuming style promotes study, that's why we adopt it,"



<P>returned Laurie, who certainly could not be accused of vanity, having



<P>voluntarily sacrificed a handsome curly crop to the demand for



<P>quarterinch-long stubble.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"By the way, Jo, I think that little Parker is really getting



<P>desperate about Amy.&nbsp; He talks of her constantly, writes poetry,

and



<P>moons about in a most suspicious manner.&nbsp; He'd better nip his little



<P>passion in the bud, hadn't he?" added Laurie, in a confidential,



<P>elder brotherly tone, after a minute's silence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Of course he had.&nbsp; We don't want any more marrying in this



<P>family for years to come.&nbsp; Mercy on us, what are the children



<P>thinking of?" And Jo looked as much scandalized as if Amy and little



<P>Parker were not yet in their teens.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's a fast age, and I don't know what we are coming to, ma'am.



<P>You are a mere infant, but you'll go next, Jo, and we'll be left



<P>lamenting," said Laurie, shaking his head over the degeneracy of the



<P>times.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't be alarmed.&nbsp; I'm not one of the agreeable sort.&nbsp; Nobody



<P>will want me, and it's a mercy, for there should always be one old



<P>maid in a family."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You won't give anyone a chance," said Laurie, with a sidelong



<P>glance and a little more color than before in his sunburned face.



<P>"You won't show the soft side of your character, and if a fellow



<P>gets a peep at it by accident and can't help showing that he likes



<P>it, you treat him as Mrs. Gummidge did her sweetheart, throw cold



<P>water over him, and get so thorny no one dares touch or look at you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't like that sort of thing.&nbsp; I'm too busy to be worried



<P>with nonsense, and I think it's dreadful to break up families so.



<P>Now don't say any more about it.&nbsp; Meg's wedding has turned all

our



<P>heads, and we talk of nothing but lovers and such absurdities.&nbsp;

I



<P>don't wish to get cross, so let's change the subject."&nbsp; And Jo



<P>looked quite ready to fling cold water on the slightest provocation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Whatever his feelings might have been, Laurie found a vent for



<P>them in a long low whistle and the fearful prediction as they parted



<P>at the gate, "Mark my words, Jo, you'll go next."

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Beth did have the fever, and was much sicker than anyone but



<P>Hannah and the doctor suspected.&nbsp; The girls knew nothing about



<P>illness, and Mr. Laurence was not allowed to see her, so Hannah had



<P>everything her own way, and busy Dr. Bangs did his best, but left a



<P>good deal to the excellent nurse.&nbsp; Meg stayed at home, lest she



<P>should infect the Kings, and kept house, feeling very anxious and a



<P>little guilty when she wrote letters in which no mention was made of



<P>Beth's illness.&nbsp; She could not think it right to deceive her mother,



<P>but she had been bidden to mind Hannah, and Hannah wouldn't hear of



<P>`Mrs. March bein' told, and worried just for sech a trifle.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo devoted herself to Beth day and night, not a hard task, for



<P>Beth was very patient, and bore her pain uncomplainingly as long as



<P>she could control herself.&nbsp; But there came a time when during the



<P>fever fits she began to talk in a hoarse, broken voice, to play on



<P>the coverlet as if on her beloved little piano, and try to sing with



<P>a throat so swollen that there was no music left, a time when she



<P>did not know the familiar faces around her, but addressed them by



<P>wrong names, and called imploringly for her mother.&nbsp; Then Jo grew



<P>frightened, Meg begged to be allowed to write the truth, and even



<P>Hannah said she `would think of it, though there was no danger



<P>yet'.&nbsp; A letter from Washington added to their trouble, for Mr.



<P>March had had a relapse, and could not think of coming home for a



<P>long while.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>How dark the days seemed now, how sad and lonely the house,



<P>and how heavy were the hearts of the sisters as they worked and



<P>waited, while the shadow of death hovered over the once happy home.



<P>Then it was that Margaret, sitting alone with tears dropping often



<P>on her work, felt how rich she had been in things more precious



<P>than any luxuries money could buy--in love, protection, peace, and



<P>health, the real blessings of life.&nbsp; Then it was that Jo, living

in



<P>the darkened room, with that suffering little sister always before



<P>her eyes and that pathetic voice sounding in her ears, learned to



<P>see the beauty and to sweetness of Beth's nature, to feel how deep



<P>and tender a place she filled in all hearts, and to acknowledge the



<P>worth of Beth's unselfish ambition to live for others, and make



<P>home happy by that exercise of those simple virtues which all may



<P>possess, and which all should love and value more than talent, wealth,



<P>or beauty.&nbsp; And Amy, in her exile, longed eagerly to be at home,

that



<P>she might work for Beth, feeling now that no service would be hard or



<P>irksome, and remembering, with regretful grief, how many neglected



<P>tasks those willing hands had done for her.&nbsp; Laurie haunted the

house



<P>like a restless ghost, and Mr. Laurence locke the grand piano, because



<P>he could not bear to be reminded of the young neighbor who used to



<P>make the twilight pleasant for him.&nbsp; Everyone missed Beth.&nbsp;

The milkman,



<P>baker, grocer, and butcher inquired how she did, poor Mrs. Hummel



<P>came to beg pardon for her thoughtlessness and to get a shroud



<P>for Minna, the neighbors sent all sorts of comforts and good wishes,



<P>and even those who knew her best were surprised to find how many



<P>friends shy little Beth had made.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meanwhile she lay on her bed with old Joanna at her side, for



<P>even in her wanderings she did not forget her forlorn protege.&nbsp;

She



<P>longed for her cats, but would not have them brought, lest they



<P>should get sick, and in her quiet hours she was full of anxiety



<P>about Jo.&nbsp; She sent loving messages to Amy, bade them tell her

mother



<P>that she would write soon, and often begged for pencil and paper to



<P>try to say a word, that Father might not think she had neglected him.



<P>But soon even these intervals of consciousness ended, and she lay



<P>hour after hour, tossing to and fro, with incoherent words on her



<P>lips, or sank into a heavy sleep which brought her no refreshment.



<P>Dr. Bangs came twice a day, Hannah sat up at night, Meg kept a



<P>telegram in her desk all ready to send off at any minute, and Jo



<P>never stirred from Beth's side.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The first of December was a wintry day indeed to them, for a



<P>bitter wind blew, snow fell fast, and the year seemed getting ready



<P>for its death.&nbsp; When Dr. Bangs came that morning, he looked long

at



<P>Beth, held the hot hand in both his own for a minute, and laid it



<P>gently down, saying, in a low voice to Hannah, "If Mrs. March can



<P>leave her husband she'd better be sent for."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Hannah nodded without speaking, for her lips twitched nervously,



<P>Meg dropped down into a chair as the strength seemed to go out of



<P>her limbs at the sound of those words, and Jo, standing with a pale



<P>face for a minute, ran to the parlor, snatched up the telegram, and



<P>throwing on her things, rushed out into the storm.&nbsp; She was soon



<P>back, and while noiselessly taking off her cloak, Laurie came in



<P>with a letter, saying that Mr. March was mending again.&nbsp; Jo read



<P>it thankfully, but the heavy weight did not seem lifted off her



<P>heart, and her face was so full of misery that Laurie asked quickly,



<P>"What is it?&nbsp; Is Beth worse?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I've sent for Mother," said Jo, tugging at her rubber boots



<P>with a tragic expression.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Good for you, Jo!&nbsp; Did you do it on your own responsibility?"



<P>asked Laurie, as he seated her in the hall chair and took off the



<P>rebellious boots, seeing how her hands shook.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No.&nbsp; The doctor told us to."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, Jo, it's not so bad as that?" cried Laurie, with a



<P>startled face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, it is.&nbsp; She doesn't know us, she doesn't even talk about



<P>the flocks of green doves, as she calls the vine leaves on the wall.



<P>She doesn't look like my Beth, and there's nobody to help us bear it.



<P>Mother and father both gone, and God seems so far away I can't find



<P>Him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As the tears streamed fast down poor Jo's cheeks, she stretched



<P>out her hand in a helpless sort of way, as if groping in the dark,



<P>and Laurie took it in his, whispering as well as he could with a



<P>lump in his throat, "I'm here.&nbsp; Hold on tome, Jo, dear!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She could not speak, but she did `hold on', and the warm grasp



<P>of the friendly human hand comforted her sore heart, and seemed to



<P>lead her nearer to the Divine arm which alone could uphold her in



<P>her trouble.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie longed to say something tender and comfortable, but no



<P>fitting words came to him, so he stood silent, gently stroking her



<P>bent head as her mother used to do.&nbsp; It was the best thing he could



<P>have done, far more soothing than the most eloquent words, for Jo



<P>felt the unspoken sympathy, and in the silence learned the sweet



<P>solace which affection administers to sorrow.&nbsp; Soon she dried the



<P>tears which had relieved her, and looked up with a grateful face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you, Teddy, I'm better now.&nbsp; I don't feel so forlorn,



<P>and will try to bear it if it comes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Keep hoping for the best, that will help you, Jo.&nbsp; Soon your



<P>mother will be here, and then everything will be all right."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm so glad Father is better.&nbsp; Now she won't feel so bad about



<P>leaving him.&nbsp; Oh, me!&nbsp; It does seem as if all the troubles

came in



<P>a heap, and I got the heaviest part on my shoulders," sighed Jo,



<P>spreading her wet handkerchief over her knees to dry.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Doesn't Meg pull fair?" asked Laurie, looking indignant.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, yes, she tries to, but she can't love Bethy as I do, and



<P>she won't miss her as I shall.&nbsp; Beth is my conscience, and I can't



<P>give her up.&nbsp; I can't!&nbsp; I can't!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Down went Jo's face into the wet handkerchief, and she cried



<P>despairingly, for she had kept up bravely till now and never shed



<P>a tear.&nbsp; Laurie drew his hand across his eyes, but could not speak



<P>till he had subdued the choky feeling in his throat and steadied his



<P>lips.&nbsp; It might be unmanly, but he couldn't help it, and I am glad



<P>of it.&nbsp; Presently, as Jo's sobs quieted, he said hopefully, "I



<P>don't think she will die.&nbsp; She's so good, and we all love her so



<P>much, I don't believe God will take her away yet."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The good and dear people always do die," groaned Jo, but she



<P>stopped crying, for her friend's words cheered her up in spite of



<P>her own doubts and fears.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Poor girl, you're worn out.&nbsp; It isn't like you to be forlorn.



<P>Stop a bit.&nbsp; I'll hearten you up in a jiffy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie went off two stairs at a time, and Jo laid her wearied



<P>head down on Beth's little brown hood, which no one had thought of



<P>moving from the table where she left it.&nbsp; It must have possessed



<P>some magic, for the submissive spirit of its gentle owner seemed



<P>to enter into Jo, and when Laurie came running down with a glass



<P>of wine, she took it with a smile, and said bravely, "I drink--



<P>Health to my Beth!&nbsp; You are a good doctor, Teddy, and such a comfortable



<P>friend.&nbsp; How can I ever pay you?" she added, as the wine



<P>refreshed her body, as the kind words had done her troubled mind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll send my bill, by-and-by, and tonight I'll give you some-



<P>thing that will warm the cockles of your heart better than quarts



<P>of wine," said Laurie, beaming at her with a face of suppressed



<P>satisfaction at something.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What is it?" cried Jo, forgetting her woes for a minute in her wonder.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I telegraphed to your mother yesterday, and Brooke answered



<P>she'd come at once, and she'll be here tonight, and everything will



<P>be all right.&nbsp; Aren't you glad I did it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie spoke very fast, and turned red and excited all in a minute,



<P>for he had kept his plot a secret, for fear of disappointing



<P>the girls or harming Beth.&nbsp; Jo grew quite white, flew out



<P>of her chair, and the moment he stopped speaking she electrified him



<P>by throwing her arms round his neck, and crying out, with a joyful



<P>cry, "Oh, Laurie!&nbsp; Oh, Mother!&nbsp; I am so glad!"&nbsp; She did

not weep



<P>again, but laughed hysterically, and trembled and clung to her



<P>friend as if she was a little bewildered by the sudden news.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie, though decidedly amazed, behaved with great



<P>presence of mind.&nbsp; He patted her back soothingly, and finding that



<P>she was recovering, followed it up by a bashful kiss or two, which



<P>brought Jo round at once.&nbsp; Holding on to the banisters, she put



<P>him gently away, saying breathlessly, "Oh, don't!&nbsp; I didn't mean



<P>to, it was dreadful of me, but you were such a dear to go and do



<P>it in spite of Hannah that I couldn't help flying at you.&nbsp; Tell



<P>me all about it, and don't give me wine again, it makes me act so."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't mind," laughed Laurie, as he settled his tie.&nbsp; "Why,



<P>you see I got fidgety, and so did Grandpa.&nbsp; We thought Hannah was



<P>overdoing the authority business, and your mother ought to know.



<P>She'd never forgive us if Beth...&nbsp; Well, if anything happened,



<P>you know.&nbsp; So I got grandpa to say it was high time we did something,



<P>and off I pelted to the office yesterday, for the doctor looked sober,



<P>and Hannah most took my head off when I proposed a telegram.&nbsp; I

never



<P>can bear to be `lorded over', so that settled my mind, and I did it.



<P>Your mother will come, I know, and the late train is in at two A.M.



<P>I shall go for her, and you've only got to bottle up your rapture,



<P>and keep Beth quiet till that blessed lady gets here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Laurie, you're an angel!&nbsp; How shall I ever thank you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Fly at me again.&nbsp; I rather liked it," said Laurie, looking



<P>mischievous, a thing he had not done for a fortnight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, thank you.&nbsp; I'll do it by proxy, when your grandpa comes.



<P>Don't tease, but go home and rest, for you'll be up half the night.



<P>Bless you, Teddy, bless you!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo had backed into a corner, and as she finished her speech,



<P>she vanished precipitately into the kitchen, where she sat down



<P>upon a dresser and told the assembled cats that she was "happy,



<P>oh, so happy!" while Laurie departed, feeling that he had made a



<P>rather neat thing of it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's the interferingest chap I ever see, but I forgive



<P>him and do hope Mrs. March is coming right away," said Hannah,



<P>with an air of relief, when Jo told the good news.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meg had a quiet rapture, and then brooded over the letter,



<P>while Jo set the sickroom in order, and Hannah `knocked up a



<P>couple of pies in case of company unexpected".&nbsp; A breath of



<P>fresh air seemed to blow through the house, and something better



<P>than sunshine brightened the quiet rooms.&nbsp; Everything appeared



<P>to feel the hopeful change.&nbsp; Beth's bird began to chirp again,



<P>and a half-blown rose was discovered on Amy's bush in the window.



<P>The fires seemed to burn with unusual cheeriness, and every time



<P>the girls met, their pale faces broke into smiles as they hugged



<P>one another, whispering encouragingly, "Mother's coming, dear!



<P>Mother's coming!"&nbsp; Every one rejoiced but Beth.&nbsp; She lay in

that



<P>heavy stupor, alike unconscious of hope and joy, doubt and danger.



<P>It was a piteous sight, the once rosy face so changed and vacant,



<P>the once busy hands so weak and wasted, the once smiling lips



<P>quite dumb, and the once pretty, well-kept hair scattered rough



<P>and tangled on the pillow.&nbsp; All day she say so, only rousing now



<P>and then to mutter, "Water!" with lips so parched they could



<P>hardly shape the word.&nbsp; All day Jo and Meg hovered over her,



<P>watching, waiting, hoping, and trusting in God and Mother, and



<P>all day the snow fell, the bitter wind raged, and the hours



<P>dragged slowly by.&nbsp; But night came at last, and every time



<P>the clock struck, the sisters, still sitting on either side of



<P>the bed, looked at each other with brightening eyes, for each



<P>hour brought help nearer.&nbsp; The doctor had been in to say that



<P>some change, for better or worse, would probably take place



<P>about midnight, at which time he would return.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Hannah, quite worn out, lay down on the sofa at the bed's



<P>foot and fell fast asleep, Mr. Laurence marched to and fro in the



<P>parlor, feeling that he would rather face a rebel battery than



<P>Mrs. March's countenance as she entered.&nbsp; Laurie lay on the rug,



<P>pretending to rest, but staring into the fire with the thoughtful



<P>look which made his black eyes beautifully soft and clear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The girls never forgot that night, for no sleep came to them



<P>as they kept their watch, with that dreadful sense of



<P>powerlessness which comes to us in hours like those.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If God spares Beth, I never will complain again," whispered



<P>Meg earnestly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If god spares Beth, I'll try to love and serve Him all my



<P>life," answered Jo, with equal fervor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wish I had no heart, it aches so," sighed Meg, after a pause.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If life is often as hard as this, I don't see how we ever



<P>shall get through it," added her sister despondently.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here the clock struck twelve, and both forgot themselves in



<P>watching Beth, for they fancied a change passed over her wan face.



<P>The house was still as death, and nothing but the wailing of the



<P>wind broke the deep hush.&nbsp; Weary Hannah slept on, and no one but



<P>the sisters saw the pale shadow which seemed to fall upon the



<P>little bed.&nbsp; An hour went by, and nothing happened except Laurie's



<P>quiet departure for the station.&nbsp; Another hour, still no one came,



<P>and anxious fears of delay in the storm, or accidents by the way,



<P>or, worst of all, a great grief at Washington, haunted the girls.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was past two, when Jo, who stood at the window thinking



<P>how dreary the world looked in its winding sheet of snow, heard



<P>a movement by the bed, and turning quickly, saw Meg kneeling



<P>before their mother's easy chair with her face hidden.&nbsp; A dreadful



<P>fear passed coldly over Jo, as she thought, "Beth is dead, and Meg



<P>is afraid to tell me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was back at her post in an instant, and to her excited



<P>eyes a great change seemed to have taken place.&nbsp; The fever flush



<P>and the look of pain were gone, and the beloved little face looked



<P>so pale and peaceful in its utter repose that Jo felt no desire to



<P>weep or to lament.&nbsp; Leaning low over this dearest of her sisters,



<P>she kissed the damp forehead with her heart on her lips, and softly



<P>whispered, "Goodby, my Beth.&nbsp; Goodby!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As if awaked by the stir, Hannah started out of her sleep,



<P>hurried to the bed, looked at Beth, felt her hands, listened at



<P>her lips, and then, throwing her apron over her head, sat down



<P>to rock to and fro, exclaiming, under her breath, "The fever's



<P>turned, she's sleepin' nat'ral, her skin's damp, and she breathes



<P>easy.&nbsp; Praise be given!&nbsp; Oh, my goodness me!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Before the girls could believe the happy truth, the doctor



<P>came to confirm it.&nbsp; He was a homely man, but they thought his



<P>face quite heavenly when he smiled and said, with a fatherly look



<P>at them, "Yes, my dears, I think the little girl will pull through



<P>this time.&nbsp; Keep the house quiet, let her sleep, and when she wakes,



<P>give her..."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>What they were to give, neither heard, for both crept into



<P>the dark hall, and, sitting on the stairs, held each other close,



<P>rejoicing with hearts too full for words.&nbsp; When they went back

to



<P>be kissed and cuddled by faithful Hannah, they found Beth lying,



<P>as she used to do, with her cheek pillowed on her hand, the



<P>dreadful pallor gone, and breathing quietly, as if just fallen



<P>asleep.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If Mother would only come now!" said Jo, as the winter night



<P>began to wane.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"See," said Meg, coming up with a white, half-opened rose,



<P>"I thought this would hardly be ready to lay in Beth's hand



<P>tomorrow if she--went away from us.&nbsp; But it has blossomed in the



<P>night, and now I mean to put it in my vase here, so that when



<P>the darling wakes, the first thing she sees will be the little



<P>rose, and Mother's face."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Never had the sun risen so beautifully, and never had the



<P>world seemed so lovely as it did to the heavy eyes of Meg and Jo,



<P>as they looked out in the early morning, when their long, sad



<P>vigil was done.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It looks like a fairy world," said Meg, smiling to herself,



<P>as she stood behind the curtain, watching the dazzling sight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hark!" cried Jo, starting to her feet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Yes, there was a sound of bells at the door below, a cry



<P>from Hannah, and then Laurie's voice saying in a joyful whisper,



<P>"Girls, she's come!&nbsp; She's come!"

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Jo, I'm anxious about Beth."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, Mother, she has seemed unusually well since the



<P>babies came."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's not her health that troubles me now, it's her spirits.



<P>I'm sure there is something on her mind, and I want you to discover



<P>what it is."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What makes you think so, Mother?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She sits alone a good deal, and doesn't talk to her father



<P>as much as she used.&nbsp; I found her crying over the babies the



<P>other day.&nbsp; When she sings, the songs are always sad ones, and



<P>now and then I see a look in her face that I don't understand.



<P>This isn't like Beth, and it worries me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Have you asked her about it?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have tried once or twice, but she either evaded my



<P>questions or looked so distressed that I stopped.&nbsp; I never



<P>force my children's confidence, and I seldom have to wait



<P>for long."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. March glanced at Jo as she spoke, but the face



<P>opposite seemed quite unconscious of any secret disquietude



<P>but Beth's, and after sewing thoughtfully for a minute, Jo



<P>said, "I think she is growing up, and so begins to dream dreams,



<P>and have hopes and fears and fidgets, without knowing why or



<P>being able to explain them.&nbsp; Why, Mother, Beth's eighteen, but



<P>we don't realize it, and treat her like a child, forgetting



<P>she's a woman."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So she is.&nbsp; Dear heart, how fast you do grow up," returned



<P>her mother with a sigh and a smile.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Can't be helped, Marmee, so you must resign yourself to



<P>all sorts of worries, and let your birds hop out of the nest,



<P>one by one.&nbsp; I promise never to hop very far, if that is any



<P>comfort to you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's a great comfort, Jo.&nbsp; I always feel strong when you



<P>are at home, now Meg is gone.&nbsp; Beth is too feeble and Amy too



<P>young to depend upon, but when the tug comes, you are always



<P>ready."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, you know I don't mind hard jobs much, and there



<P>must always be one scrub in a family.&nbsp; Amy is splendid in fine



<P>works and I'm not, but I feel in my element when all the carpets



<P>are to be taken up, or half the family fall sick at once.



<P>Amy is distinguishing herself abroad, but if anything is amiss



<P>at home, I'm your man."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I leave Beth to your hands, then, for she will open her



<P>tender little heart to her Jo sooner than to anyone else.&nbsp; Be



<P>very kind, and don't let her think anyone watches or talks



<P>about; her.&nbsp; If she only would get quite strong and cheerful



<P>again, I shouldn't have a wish in the world."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Happy woman!&nbsp; I've got heaps."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear, what are they?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll settle Bethy's troubles, and then I'll tell you mine.



<P>They are not very wearing, so they'll keep."&nbsp; And Jo stitched away,



<P>with a wise nod which set her mother's heart at rest about her for



<P>the present at least.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While apparently absorbed in her own affairs, Jo watched



<P>Beth, and after many conflicting conjectures, finally settled



<P>upon one which seemed to explain the change in her.&nbsp; A slight



<P>incident gave Jo the clue to the mystery, she thought, and



<P>lively fancy, loving heart did the rest.&nbsp; She was affecting



<P>to write busily one Saturday afternoon, when she and Beth were



<P>alone together.&nbsp; Yet as she scribbled, she kept her eye on her



<P>sister, who seemed unusually quiet.&nbsp; Sitting at the window, Beth's



<P>work often dropped into her lap, and she leaned her head upon her



<P>hand, in a dejected attitude, while her eyes rested on the dull,



<P>autumnal landscape.&nbsp; Suddenly some one passed below, whistling



<P>like an operatic blackbird, and a voice called out, "All serene!



<P>Coming in tonight."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Beth started, leaned forward, smiled and nodded, watched the



<P>passer-by till his quick tramp died away, then said softly as if



<P>to herself, "How strong and well and happy that dear boy looks."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hum!" said Jo, still intent upon her sister's face, for the



<P>bright color faded as quickly as it came, the smile vanished, and



<P>presently a tear lay shining on the window ledge.&nbsp; Beth whisked



<P>it off, and in her half-averted face read a tender sorrow that



<P>made her own eyes fill.&nbsp; Fearing to betray herself, she slipped



<P>away, murmuring something about needing more paper.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mercy on me, Beth loves Laurie!" she said, sitting down in



<P>her own room, pale with the shock of the discovery which she



<P>believed she had just made.&nbsp; "I never dreamed of such a thing.



<P>What will Mother say?&nbsp; I wonder if her..."&nbsp; there Jo stopped



<P>and turned scarlet with a sudden thought.&nbsp; "If he shouldn't love



<P>back again, how dreadful it would be.&nbsp; He must.&nbsp; I'll make

him!"



<P>And she shook her head threateningly at the picture of the mischievous-



<P>looking boy laughing at her from the wall.&nbsp; "Oh dear, we are



<P>growing up with a vengeance.&nbsp; Here's Meg married and a mamma,



<P>Amy flourishing away at Paris, and Beth in love.&nbsp; I'm the only



<P>one that has sense enough to keep out of mischief."&nbsp; Jo thought



<P>intently for a minute with her eyes fixed on the picture, then



<P>she smoothed out her wrinkled forehead and said, with a decided



<P>nod at the face opposite, "No thank you, sir, you're very



<P>charming, but you've no more stability than a weathercock.&nbsp; So



<P>you needn't write touching notes and smile in that insinuating



<P>way, for it won't do a bit of good, and I won't have it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then she sighed, and fell into a reverie from which she



<P>did not wake till the early twilight sent her down to take new



<P>observations, which only confirmed her suspicion.&nbsp; Though



<P>Laurie flirted with Amy and joked with Jo, his manner to Beth



<P>had always been peculiarly kind and gentle, but so was everybody's.



<P>Therefore, no one thought of imagining that he cared more



<P>for her than for the others.&nbsp; Indeed, a general impression



<P>had prevailed in the family of late that `our boy' was getting



<P>fonder than ever of Jo, who, however, wouldn't hear a word upon



<P>the subject and scolded violently if anyone dared to suggest it.



<P>If they had known the various tender passages which had been



<P>nipped in the bud, they would have had the immense satisfaction



<P>of saying, "I told you so."&nbsp; But Jo hated `philandering', and



<P>wouldn't allow it, always having a joke or a smile ready at the



<P>least sign of impending danger.



<P>When Laurie first went to college, he fell in love about



<P>once a month, but these small flames were as brief as ardent,



<P>did no damage, and much amused Jo, who took great interest in



<P>the alternations of hop, despair, and resignation, which were



<P>confided to her in their weekly conferences.&nbsp; But there came a



<P>time when Laurie ceased to worship at many shrines, hinted



<P>darkly at one all-absorbing passion, and indulged occasionally



<P>in Byronic fits of gloom.&nbsp; Then he avoided the tender subject



<P>altogether, wrote philosophical notes to Jo, turned studious,



<P>and gave out that he was going to `dig', intending to graduate



<P>in a blaze of glory.&nbsp; This suited the young lady better than



<P>twilight confidences, tender pressures of the hand, and



<P>eloquent glances of the eye, for with Jo, brain developed



<P>earlier than heart, and she preferred imaginary heroes to



<P>real ones, because when tired of them, the former could be



<P>shut up in the tin kitchen till called for, and the latter



<P>were less manageable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Things were in this state when the grand discovery was



<P>made, and Jo watched Laurie that night as she had never done



<P>before.&nbsp; If she had not got the new idea into her head, she



<P>would have seen nothing unusual in the fact that Beth was



<P>very quiet, and Laurie very kind to her.&nbsp; But having given the



<P>rein to her lively fancy, it galloped away with her at a great



<P>pace, and common sense, being rather weakened by a long course



<P>or romance writing, did not come to the rescue.&nbsp; As usual Beth



<P>lay on the sofa and Laurie sat in a low chair close by, amusing



<P>her with all sorts of gossip, for she depended on her weekly



<P>`spin', and he never disappointed her.&nbsp; But that evening Jo



<P>fancied that Beth's eyes rested on the lively, dark face



<P>beside her with peculiar pleasure, and that she listened with



<P>intense interest to an account of some exciting cricket match,



<P>though the phrases, `caught off a tice', `stumped off his ground'',



<P>and `the leg hit for three', were as intelligible to her as



<P>Sanskrit.&nbsp; She also fancied, having set her heart upon seeing it,



<P>that she saw a certain increase of gentleness in Laurie's manner,



<P>that he dropped his voice now and then, laughed less than usual,



<P>was a little absent--minded, and settled the afghan over Beth's



<P>feet with an assiduity that was really almost tender.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Who knows?&nbsp; Stranger things have happened," thought Jo,



<P>as she fussed about the room.&nbsp; "She will make quite an angel



<P>of him, and he will make life delightfully easy and pleasant



<P>for the dear, if they only love each other.&nbsp; I don't see how he



<P>can help it, and I do believe he would if the rest of us were out of



<P>the way."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As everyone was out of the way but herself, Jo began to



<P>feel that she ought to dispose of herself with all speed.&nbsp; But



<P>where should she go? And burning to lay herself upon the shrine



<P>of sisterly devotion, she sat down to settle that point.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, the old sofa was a regular patriarch of a sofa--long,



<P>broad, well-cushioned, and low, a trifle shabby, as well it might



<P>be, for the girls had slept and sprawled on it as babies,



<P>fished over the back, rode on the arms, and had menageries



<P>under it as children, and rested tired heads, dreamed dreams,



<P>and listened to tender talk on it as young women.&nbsp; They all loved



<P>it, for it was a family refuge, and one corner had always been



<P>Jo's favorite lounging place.&nbsp; Among the many pillows that adorned



<P>the venerable couch was one, hard, round, covered with prickly



<P>horsehair, and furnished with a knobby button at each end.&nbsp; This



<P>repulsive pillow was her especial property, being used as a weapon



<P>of defense, a barricade, or a stern preventive of too much slumber.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Laurie knew this pillow well, and had cause to regard it with



<P>deep aversion, having been unmercifully pummeled with it in former



<P>days when romping was allowed, and now frequently debarred by it



<P>from the seat he most coveted next ot Jo in the sofa corner.&nbsp; If



<P>`the sausage' as the called it, stood on end, it was a sign that



<P>he might approach and repose, but if it lay flat across the sofa,



<P>woe to man, woman, or child who dared disturb it!&nbsp; That evening



<P>Jo forgot to barricade her corner, and had not been in her seat



<P>five minutes, before a massive form appeared beside her, and with



<P>both arms spread over the sofa back, both long legs stretched out



<P>before him, Laurie exclaimed, with a sigh of satisfaction...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now, this is filling at the price."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No slang," snapped Jo, slamming down the pillow.&nbsp; But it was



<P>too late, there was no room for it, and coasting onto the floor,



<P>it disappeared in a most mysterious manner.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Come, Jo, don't be thorny.&nbsp; After studying himself to a



<P>skeleton all the week, a fellow deserves petting and ought to get



<P>it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Beth will pet you.&nbsp; I'm busy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, she's not to be bothered with me, but you like that sort



<P>of thing, unless you've suddenly lost your taste for it.&nbsp; Have

you?



<P>Do you hate your boy, and want to fire pillows at him?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anything more wheedlesome than that touching appeal was seldom



<P>heard, but Jo quenched `her boy' by turning on him with a stern



<P>query, "How many bouquets have you sent Miss Randal this week?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not one, upon my word.&nbsp; She's engaged.&nbsp; Now then."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm glad of it, that's one of your foolish extravagances,



<P>sending flowers and things to girls for whom you don't care two



<P>pins," continued Jo reprovingly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sensible girls for whom I do care whole papers of pins won't



<P>let me send them `flowers and things', so what can I do?&nbsp; My feelings



<P>need a` vent'."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mother doesn't approve of flirting even in fun, and you do



<P>flirt desperately, Teddy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'd give anything if I could answer, `So do you'.&nbsp; As I can't,



<P>I'll merely say that I don't see any harm in that pleasant little



<P>game, if all parties understand that it's only play."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, it does look pleasant, but I can't learn how it's done.



<P>I've tried, because one feels awkward in company not to do as



<P>everybody else id doing, but I don't seem to get on", said Jo,



<P>forgetting to play mentor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Take lessons of Amy, she has a regular talent for it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, she does it very prettily, and never seems to go too



<P>far.&nbsp; I suppose it's natural to some people to please without



<P>trying, and others to always say and do the wrong thing in the



<P>wrong place."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm glad you can't flirt.&nbsp; It's really refreshing to see a



<P>sensible, straightforward girl, who can be jolly and kind without



<P>making a fool of herself.&nbsp; Between ourselves, Jo, some of the



<P>girls I know really do go on at such a rate I'm ashamed of them.



<P>They don't mean any harm, I'm sure, but if they knew how we



<P>fellows talked about them afterward, they'd mend their ways, I



<P>fancy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They do the same, and as their tongues are the sharpest,



<P>you fellows get the worst of it, for you are as silly as they,



<P>every bit.&nbsp; If you behaved properly, they would, but knowing



<P>you like their nonsense, they keep it up, and then you blame



<P>them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Much you know about it, ma'am," said Laurie in a superior tone.



<P>"We don't like romps and flirts, though we may act as if



<P>we did sometimes.&nbsp; The pretty, modest girls are never



<P>talked about, except respectfully, among gentleman.



<P>Bless your innocent soul!&nbsp; If you could be in my place



<P>for a month you'd see things that would astonish you a trifle.



<P>Upon my word, when I see one of those harum-scarum girls,



<P>I always want to say with our friend Cock Robin...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Out upon you, fie upon you,



<P>Bold-faced jig!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was impossible to help laughing at the funny conflict



<P>between Laurie's chivalrous reluctance to speak ill of womankind,



<P>and his very natural dislike of the unfeminine folly of



<P>which fashionable society showed him many samples.&nbsp; Jo knew



<P>that `young Laurence' was regarded as a most eligible parti



<P>by worldly mamas, was much smiled upon by their daughters,



<P>and flattered enough by ladies of all ages to make a coxcomb



<P>of him, so she watched him rather jealously, fearing



<P>he would be spoiled, and rejoiced more than she confessed



<P>to find that he still believed in modest girls.&nbsp; Returning



<P>suddenly to her admonitory tone, she said, dropping her



<P>voice, "If you must have a `went', Teddy, go and devote



<P>yourself to one of the `pretty, modest girls' whom you do



<P>respect, and not waste your time with the silly ones."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You really advise it?" And Laurie looked at her with



<P>an odd mixture of anxiety and merriment in his face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, I do, but you'd better wait till you are through



<P>college, on the whole, and be fitting yourself for the place



<P>meantime.&nbsp; You're not half good enough for--well, whoever



<P>the modest girl may be."&nbsp; And Jo looked a little queer likewise,



<P>for a name had almost escaped her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That I'm not!" acquiesced Laurie, with an expression of



<P>humility quite new to him, as he dropped his eyes and absently



<P>wound Jo's apron tassel round his finger.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mercy on us, this will never do," thought Jo, adding



<P>aloud, "Go and sing to me.&nbsp; I'm dying for some music, and



<P>always like yours."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'd rather stay here, thank you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, you can't, there isn't room.&nbsp; Go and make yourself



<P>useful, since you are too big to be ornamental.&nbsp; I thought you



<P>hated to be tied to a woman's apron string?" retorted Jo,



<P>quoting certain rebellious words of his own.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, that depends on who wears the apron!" and Laurie



<P>gave an audacious tweak at the tassel.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Are you going?" demanded Jo, diving for the pillow.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He fled at once, and the minute it was well, "Up with the



<P>bonnets of bonnie Dundee," she slipped away to return no more



<P>till the young gentleman departed in high dudgeon.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo lay long awake that night, and was just dropping off



<P>when the sound of a stifled sob made her fly to Beth's bedside,



<P>with the anxious inquiry, "What is it, dear?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I thought you were asleep," sobbed Beth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Is it the old pain, my precious?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, it's a new one, but I can bear it."&nbsp; And Beth tried



<P>to check her tears.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Tell me all about it, and let me cure it as I often did



<P>the other."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You can't, there is no cure."&nbsp; There Beth's voice gave



<P>way, and clinging to her sister, she cried so despairingly



<P>that Jo was frightened.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Where is it?&nbsp; Shall I call Mother?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, no, don't call her, don't tell her.&nbsp; I shall be



<P>better soon.&nbsp; Lie down here and `poor' my head.&nbsp; I'll be



<P>quiet and go to sleep, indeed I will."



<P>Jo obeyed, but as her hand went softly to and fro across



<P>Beth's hot forehead and wet eyelids, her heart was very full



<P>and she longed to speak.&nbsp; But young as she was, Jo had learned



<P>that hearts, like flowers, cannot be rudely handled, but must



<P>open naturally, so though she believed she knew the cause of



<P>Beth's new pain, she only said, in her tenderest tone, "Does



<P>anything trouble you, deary?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, Jo," after a long pause.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Wouldn't it comfort you to tell me what it is?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"not now, not yet."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then I won't ask, but remember, Bethy, that Mother and



<P>Jo are always glad to hear and help you, if they can."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I know it.&nbsp; I'll tell you by-and-by."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Is the pain better now?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, yes, much better, you are so comfortable, Jo."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Go to sleep, dear.&nbsp; I'll stay with you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So cheek to cheek they fell asleep, and on the morrow



<P>Beth seemed quite herself again, for at eighteen neither heads



<P>nor hearts ache long, and a loving word can medicine most ills.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Jo had made up her mind, and after pondering over a



<P>project for some days, she confided it to her mother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You asked me the other day what my wishes were.&nbsp; I'll



<P>tell you one of them, Marmee," she began, as they sat along



<P>together.&nbsp; "I want to go away somewhere this winter for a



<P>change."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, Jo?" And her mother looked up quickly, as if the



<P>words suggested a double meaning.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With her eyes on her work Jo answered soberly, "I want



<P>something new.&nbsp; I feel restless and anxious to be seeing,



<P>doing, and learning more than I am.&nbsp; I brood too much over



<P>my own small affairs, and need stirring up, so as I can be



<P>spared this winter, I'd like to hop a little way and try my



<P>wings."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Where will you hop?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To New York.&nbsp; I had a bright idea yesterday, and this is



<P>it.&nbsp; You know Mrs. Kirke wrote to you for some respectable



<P>young person to teach her children and sew.&nbsp; It's rather hard



<P>to find just the thing, but I think I should suit if I tried."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear, go out to service in that great boarding house!"



<P>And Mrs. March looked surprised, but not displeased.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's not exactly going out to service, for Mrs. Kirke is



<P>your friend--the kindest soul that ever lived--and would make



<P>things pleasant for me, I know.&nbsp; Her family is separate from



<P>the rest, and no one knows me there.&nbsp; Don't care if they do.



<P>It's honest work, and I'm not ashamed of it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nor I.&nbsp; But your writing?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"All the better for the change.&nbsp; I shall see and hear new



<P>things, get new ideas, and even if I haven't much time there,



<P>I shall bring home quantities of material for my rubbish."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have no doubt of it, but are these your only reasons for



<P>this sudden fancy?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, Mother."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"May I know the others?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo looked up and Jo looked down, then said slowly, with



<P>sudden color in her cheeks.&nbsp; "It may be vain and wrong to



<P>say it, but--I'm afraid--Laurie is getting too fond of me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then you don't care for him in the way it is evident he



<P>begins to care for you?' And Mrs. March looked anxious as she



<P>put the question.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mercy, no!&nbsp; I love the dear boy, as I always have, and



<P>am immensely proud of him, but as for anything more, it's out



<P>of the question."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm glad of that, Jo."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, please?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Because, dear, I don't think you suited to one another.&nbsp; As



<P>friends you are very happy, and your frequent quarrels soon blow



<P>over, but I fear you would both rebel if you were mated for life.



<P>You are too much alike and too fond of freedom, not to mention



<P>hot tempers and strong wills, to get on happily together, in a



<P>relation which needs infinite patience and forbearance, as well



<P>as love."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's just the feeling I had, though I couldn't express it.



<P>I'm glad you think he is only beginning to care for me.&nbsp; It would



<P>trouble me sadly to make him unhappy, for I couldn't fall in love



<P>with the dear old fellow merely out of gratitude, could I?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are sure of his feeling for you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The color deepened in Jo's cheeks as she answered, with



<P>the look of mingled pleasure, pride, and pain which young



<P>girls wear when speaking of first lovers, "I'm afraid it is



<P>so, Mother.&nbsp; He hasn't said anything, but he looks a great deal.



<P>I think I had better go away before it comes to anything."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I agree with you, and if it can be managed you shall go."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo looked relieved, and after a pause, said, smiling, "How



<P>Mrs. Moffat would wonder at your want of management, if she



<P>knew, and how she will rejoice that Annie may still hope."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"AH, Jo, mothers may differ in their management, but the



<P>hope is the same in all--the desire to see their children happy.



<P>Meg is so, and I am content with her success.&nbsp; You I leave to



<P>enjoy your liberty till you tire of it, for only then will you



<P>find that there is something sweeter.&nbsp; Amy is my chief care



<P>now, but her good sense will help ;her.&nbsp; For Beth, I indulge



<P>no hopes except that she may be well.&nbsp; By the way, she seems



<P>brighter this last day or two.&nbsp; Have you spoken to her?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, she owned she had a trouble, and promised to tell



<P>me by-and-by.&nbsp; I said no more, for I think I know it," And



<P>Jo told her little story.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. March shook her head, and did not take so romantic



<P>a view of the case, but looked grave, and repeated her opinion



<P>that for Laurie's sake Jo should go away for a time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Let us say nothing about it to him till the plan is settled,



<P>then I'll run away before he can collect his wits and be tragic.



<P>Beth must think I'm going to please myself, as I am, for I can't



<P>talk about Laurie to her.&nbsp; But she can pet and comfort him after



<P>I'm gone, and so cure him of this romantic notion.&nbsp; He's been



<P>through so many little trials of the sort, he's used to it, and



<P>will soon get over his lovelornity."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo spoke hopefully, but could not rid herself of the foreboding



<P>fear that this `little trial' would be harder than the others,



<P>and that Laurie would not get over his `lovelornity' as easily



<P>as heretofore.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The plan was talked over in a family council and agreed



<P>upon, for Mrs. Kirke gladly accepted Jo, and promised to



<P>make a pleasant home for her.&nbsp; The teaching would render



<P>her independent, and such leisure as she got might be made



<P>profitable by writing, while the new scenes and society would



<P>be both useful and agreeable.&nbsp; Jo liked the prospect and was



<P>eager to be gone, for the home nest was growing too narrow



<P>for her restless nature and adventurous spirit.&nbsp; When all was



<P>settled, with fear and trembling she told Laurie, but to her



<P>surprise he took it very quietly.&nbsp; He had been graver than



<P>usual of late, but very pleasant, and when jokingly accused



<P>of turning over a new leaf, he answered soberly, "So I am,



<P>and I mean this one shall stay turned."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo was very much relieved that one of his virtuous fits



<P>should come on just then, and made her preparations with a



<P>lightened heart, for Beth seemed more cheerful, and hoped



<P>she was doing the best for all.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"One thing I leave in your especial care," she said, the



<P>night before she left.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You mean your papers?" asked Beth.



<P>"No, my boy.&nbsp; Be very good to him, won't you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Of course I will, but I can't fill your place, and he'll



<P>miss you sadly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It won't hurt him, so remember, I leave him in your



<P>charge, to plague, pet, and keep in order."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'll do my best, for your sake," promised Beth, wondering



<P>why Jo looked at her so queerly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Laurie said good-by, he whispered significantly, "It



<P>won't do a bit of good, Jo.&nbsp; My eye is on you, so mind what you



<P>do, or I'll come and bring you home."

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It takes people a long time to learn the difference between



<P>talent and genius, especially ambitious young men and women.



<P>Amy was learning this distinction through much tribulation, for



<P>mistaking enthusiasm for inspiration, she attempted every branch of



<P>art with youthful audacity.&nbsp; For a long time there was a lull in



<P>the `mud-pie' business, and she devoted herself to the finest



<P>pen-and-ink drawing, in which she showed such taste and skill that



<P>her graceful handiwork proved both pleasant and profitable.&nbsp; But



<P>over-strained eyes caused pen and ink to be laid aside for a bold



<P>attempt at poker sketching.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While this attack lasted, the family lived in constant fear



<P>of a conflagration, for the odor of burning wood pervaded the



<P>house at all hours, smoke issued from attic and shed with



<P>alarming frequency, red-hot pokers lay about promiscuously, and Hannah



<P>never went to bed without a pail of water and the dinner bell at



<P>her door in case of fire.&nbsp; Raphael's face was found boldly executed



<P>on the underside of the moulding board, and Bacchus on the head of a



<P>beer barrel.&nbsp; A chanting cherub adorned the cover of the sugar

bucket,



<P>and attempts to portray Romeo and Juliet supplied kindling for some

time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>From fire to oil was a natural transition for burned fingers,



<P>and Amy fell to painting with undiminished ardor.&nbsp; An artist friend



<P>fitted her out with his castoff palettes, brushes, and colors, and



<P>she daubed away, producing pastoral and marine views such as were



<P>never seen on land or sea.&nbsp; Her monstrosities in the way of cattle



<P>would have taken prizes at an agricultural fair, and the perilous



<P>pitching of her vessels would have produced seasickness in the most



<P>nautical observer, if the utter disregard to all known rules of



<P>shipbuilding and rigging had not convulsed him with laughter at the



<P>first glance.&nbsp; Swarthy boys and dark-eyed Madonnas, staring at

you



<P>from one corner of the studio, suggested Murillo.&nbsp; Oily brown shadows



<P>of faces with a lurid streak in the wrong place, meant Rembrandt.



<P>Buxom ladies and dropiscal infants, Rubens, and Turner appeared in



<P>tempests of blue thunder, orange lightning, brown rain, and purple



<P>clouds, with a tomato-colored splash in the middle, which might be



<P>the sun or a bouy, a sailor's shirt or a king's robe, as the



<P>spectator pleased.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Charcoal portraits came next, and the entire family hung in a



<P>row, looking as wild and crocky as if just evoked from a coalbin.



<P>Softened into crayon sketches, they did better, for the likenesses



<P>were good, and Amy's hair, Jo's nose, Meg's mouth, and Laurie's



<P>eyes were pronounced `wonderfully fine'.&nbsp; A return to clay and



<P>plaster followed, and ghostly casts of her acquaintances haunted



<P>corners of the house, or tumbled off closet shelves onto people's



<P>heads.&nbsp; Children were enticed in as models, till their incoherent



<P>accounts of her mysterious doings caused Miss Amy to be regarded in



<P>the light of a young ogress.&nbsp; Her efforts in this line, however,



<P>were brought to an abrupt close by an untoward accident, which



<P>quenched her ardor.&nbsp; Other models failing her for a time, she



<P>undertook to cast her own pretty foot, and the family were one day



<P>alarmed by an unearthly bumping and screaming and running to the rescue,



<P>found the young enthusiast hopping wildly about the shed with her



<P>foot held fast in a pan full of plaster, which had hardened with



<P>unexpected rapidity.&nbsp; With much difficulty and some danger she

was



<P>dug out, for Jo was so overcome with laughter while she excavated



<P>that her knife went too far, cut the poor foot, and left a lasting



<P>memorial of one artistic attempt, at least.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After this Amy subsided, till a mania for sketching from nature



<P>set her to haunting river, field, and wood, for picturesque studies,



<P>and sighing for ruins to copy.&nbsp; She caught endless colds sitting

on



<P>damp grass to book `delicious bit', composed of a stone, a stump, one



<P>mushroom, and a broken mullein stalk, or `a heavenly mass of clouds',



<P>that looked like a choice display of featherbeds when done.&nbsp; She



<P>sacrificed her complexion floating on the river in the midsummer sun

to



<P>study light and shade, and got a wrinkle over her nose trying after



<P>`points of sight', or whatever the squint-and-string performance is

called.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If `genius is eternal patience', as Michelangelo affirms, Amy



<P>had some claim to the divine attribute, for she persevered in spite



<P>of all obstacles, failures, and discouragements, firmly believing



<P>that in time she should do something worthy to be called `high art'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was learning, doing, and enjoying other things, meanwhile,



<P>for she had resolved to be an attractive and accomplished woman,



<P>even if she never became a great artist.&nbsp; Here she succeeded better,



<P>for she was one of those happily created beings who please without



<P>effort, make friends everywhere, and take life so gracefully and



<P>easily that less fortunate souls are tempted to believe that such



<P>are born under a lucky star.&nbsp; Everybody liked her, for among her



<P>good gifts was tact.&nbsp; She had an instinctive sense of what was



<P>pleasing and proper, always said the right thing to the right person,



<P>did just what suited the time and place, and was so self-possessed



<P>that her sisters used to say, "If Amy went to court without any



<P>rehearsal beforehand, she'd know exactly what to do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One of her weaknesses was a desire to move in `our best society',



<P>without being quite sure what the best really was.&nbsp; Money, position,



<P>fashionable accomplishments, and elegant manners were most desirable



<P>things in her eyes, and she liked to associate with those who



<P>possessed them, often mistaking the false for the true, and admiring

what



<P>was not admirable.&nbsp; Never forgetting that by birth she was a gentlewoman,



<P>she cultivated her aristocratic tastes and feelings, so that when



<P>the opportunity came she might be ready to take the place from



<P>which poverty now excluded her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My lady," as her friends called her, sincerely desired to be



<P>a genuine lady, and was so at heart, but had yet to learn that money



<P>cannot buy refinement of nature, that rank does not always confer



<P>nobility, and that true breeding makes itself felt in spite of



<P>external drawbacks.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I want to ask a favor of you, Mamma," Amy said, coming in



<P>with an important air one day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, little girl, what is it?" replied her mother, in whose



<P>eyes the stately young lady still remained `the baby'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Our drawing class breaks up next week, and before the girls



<P>separate for the summer, I want to ask them out here for a day.&nbsp;

They



<P>are wild to see the river, sketch the broken bridge, and copy some



<P>of the things they admire in my book.&nbsp; They have been very kind

to



<P>me in many ways, and I am grateful, for they are all rich and I know



<P>I am poor, yet they never made any difference."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why should they?" And Mrs. March put the question with what



<P>the girls called her `Maria Theresa air'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You know as well as I that it does make a difference with



<P>nearly everyone, so don't ruffle up like a dear, motherly hen, when



<P>your chickens get pecked by smarter birds.&nbsp; The ugly duckling turned



<P>out a swan, you know."&nbsp; And Amy smiled without bitterness, for

she



<P>possessed a happy temper and hopeful spirit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. March laughed, and smoothed down her maternal pride as



<P>she asked, "Well, my swan, what is your plan?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I should like to ask the girls out to lunch next week, to take



<P>them for a drive to the places they want to see, a row on the river,



<P>perhaps, and make a little artistic fete for them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That looks feasible.&nbsp; What do you want for lunch?&nbsp; Cake,



<P>sandwiches, fruit, and coffee will be all that is necessary, I suppose?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, dear, no!&nbsp; We must have cold tongue and chicken, French



<P>chocolate and ice cream, besides.&nbsp; The girls are used to such things,



<P>and I want my lunch to be proper and elegant, though I do work for



<P>my living."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How many young ladies are there?" asked her mother, beginning



<P>to look sober.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Twelve or fourteen in the class, but I dare say they won't all come."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Bless me, child, you will have to charter an omnibus to carry



<P>them about."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, Mother, how can you think of such a thing?&nbsp; Not more than



<P>six or eight will probably come, so I shall hire a beach wagon and



<P>borrow Mr. Laurence's cherry-bounce." (Hannah's pronunciation of



<P>charabanc.)

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"All of this will be expensive, Amy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not very.&nbsp; I've calculated the cost, and I'll pay for it myself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't you think, dear, that as these girls are used to such



<P>things, and the best we can do will be nothing new, that some simpler



<P>plan would be pleasanter to them, as a change if nothing more, and



<P>much better for us than buying or borrowing what we don't need, and



<P>attempting a style not in keeping with our circumstances?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If I can't have it as I like, I don't care to have it at all.



<P>I know that I can carry it out perfectly well, if you and the girls



<P>will help a little, and I don't see why I can't if I'm willing to pay



<P>for it," said Amy, with the decision which opposition was apt to



<P>change into obstinacy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. March knew that experience was an excellent teacher, and



<P>when it was possible she left her children to learn alone the lessons



<P>which she would gladly have made easier, if they had not objected to



<P>taking advice as much as they did salts and senna.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very well, Amy, if your heart is set upon it, and you see your



<P>way through without too great an outlay of money, time, and temper,



<P>I'll say no more.&nbsp; Talk it over with the girls, and whichever way



<P>you decide, I'll do my best to help you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thanks, Mother, you are always so kind."&nbsp; And away went Amy to



<P>lay her plan before her sisters.



<P>Meg agreed at once, and promised to her aid, gladly offering



<P>anything she possessed, from her little house itself to her very



<P>best saltspoons.&nbsp; But Jo frowned upon the whole project and would



<P>have nothing to do with it at first.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why in the world should you spend your money, worry your family,



<P>and turn the house upside down for a parcel of girls who don't care

a



<P>sixpence for you?&nbsp; I thought you had too much pride and sense to



<P>truckle to any mortal woman just because she wears French boots and



<P>rides in a coupe," said Jo, who, being called from the tragic climax



<P>of her novel, was not in the best mood for social enterprises.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't truckle, and I hate being patronized as much as you do!"



<P>returned Amy indignantly, for the two still jangled when such



<P>questions arose.&nbsp; "The girls do care for me, and I for them, and

there's a



<P>great deal of kindness and sense and talent among them, in spite of



<P>what you call fashionable nonsense.&nbsp; You don't care to make people



<P>like you, to go into good society, and cultivate your manners and



<P>tastes.&nbsp; I do, and I mean to make the most of every chance that

comes.



<P>You can go through the world with your elbows out and your nose in the



<P>air, and call it independence, if you like.&nbsp; That's not my way."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Amy had whetted her tongue and freed her mind she usually



<P>got the best of it, for she seldom failed to have common sense on her



<P>side, while Jo carried her love of liberty and hate of conventionalities



<P>to such an unlimited extent that she naturally found herself



<P>worsted in an argument.&nbsp; Amy's definition of Jo's idea of independence



<P>was such a good hit that both burst out laughing, and the discussion



<P>took a more amiable turn.&nbsp; Much against her will, Jo at length



<P>consented to sacrifice a day to Mrs. Grundy, and help her sister



<P>through what she regarded as `a nonsensical business'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The invitations were sent, nearly all accepted, and the following



<P>Monday was set apart for the grand event.&nbsp; Hannah was out of humor



<P>because her week's work was deranged, and prophesied that "ef the



<P>washin' and ironin' warn't done reg'lar, nothin' would go well



<P>anywheres".&nbsp; This hitch in the mainspring of the domestic machinery



<P>had a bad effect upon the whole concern, but Amy's motto was `Nil



<P>desperandum', and having made up her mind what to do, she proceeded



<P>to do it in spite of all obstacles.&nbsp; To begin with, Hannah's cooking



<P>didn't turn out well.&nbsp; The chicken was tough, the tongue too salt,



<P>and the chocolate wouldn't froth properly.&nbsp; Then the cake and ice

cost



<P>more than Amy expected, so did the wagon, and various other expenses,



<P>which seemed trifling at the outset, counted up rather alarmingly



<P>afterward.&nbsp; Beth got a cold and took to her bed.&nbsp; Meg had

an unusual



<P>number of callers to keep her at home, and Jo was in such a divided



<P>state of mind that her breakages, accidents, and mistakes were



<P>uncommonly numerous, serious, and trying.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It it was not fair on Monday, the young ladies were to come on



<P>Tuesday, and arrangement which aggravated Jo and Hannah to the last



<P>degree.&nbsp; On Monday morning the weather was in that undecided state



<P>which is more exasperating than a steady pour.&nbsp; It drizzled a little,



<P>shone a little, blew a little, and didn't make up its mind till it



<P>was too late for anyone else to make up theirs.&nbsp; Amy was up at

dawn,



<P>hustling people out of their beds and through their breakfasts, that



<P>the house might be got in order.&nbsp; The parlor struck her as looking



<P>uncommonly shabby, but without stopping to sigh for what she had not,



<P>she skillfully made the best of what she had, arranging chairs over



<P>the worn places in the carpet, covering stains on the walls with



<P>homemade statuary, which gave an artistic air to the room, as did the



<P>lovely vases of flowers Jo scattered about.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The lunch looked charming, and as she surveyed it, she sincerely



<P>hoped it would taste well, and that the borrowed glass, china, and



<P>silver would get safely home again.&nbsp; The carriages were promised,

Meg



<P>and Mother were all ready to do the honors, Beth was able to help



<P>Hannah behind the scenes, Jo had engaged to be as lively and amiable



<P>as an absent mind, and aching head, and a very decided disapproval of



<P>everybody and everything would allow, and as she wearily dressed, Amy



<P>cheered herself with anticipations of the happy moment when, lunch



<P>safely over, she should drive away with her friends for an afternoon



<P>of artistic delights, for the `cherry bounce' and the broken bridge



<P>were her strong points.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then came the hours of suspense, during which she vibrated from



<P>parlor to porch, while public opinion varied like the weathercock.&nbsp;

A



<P>smart shower at eleven had evidently quenched the enthusiasm of the



<P>young ladies who were to arrive at twelve, for nobody came, and at two



<P>the exhausted family sat down in a blaze of sunshine to consume the



<P>perishable portions of the feast, that nothing might be lost.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No doubt about the weather today, they will certainly come, so



<P>we must fly round and be ready for them," said Amy, as the sun woke



<P>her next morning.&nbsp; She spoke briskly, but in her secret soul she

wished



<P>she had said nothing about Tuesday, for her interest like her cake was



<P>getting a little stale.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I can't get any lobsters, so you will have to do without salad



<P>today," said Mr. March, coming in half an hour later, with an



<P>expression of placid despair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Use the chicken then, the toughness won't matter in a salad,"



<P>advised his wife.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hannah left it on the kitchen table a minute, and the kittens got at

it.



<P>I'm very sorry, amy," added Beth, who was still a patroness of cats.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then I must have a lobster, for tongue alone won't do," said Amy decidedly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Shall I rush into town and demand one?" asked Jo, with the



<P>magnanimity of a martyr.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You'd come bringing it home under your arm without any paper,



<P>just to try me.&nbsp; I'll go myself," answered Amy, whose temper was



<P>beginning to fail.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Shrouded in a thick veil and armed with a genteel traveling basket,



<P>she departed, feeling that a cool drive would soothe her ruffled spirit



<P>and fit her for the labors of the day.&nbsp; After some delay, the object

of



<P>her desire was procured, likewise a bottle of dressing to prevent



<P>further loss of time at home, and off she drove again, well pleased

with



<P>her own forethought.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As the omnibus contained only one other passenger, a sleepy old



<P>lady, Amy pocketed her veil and beguiled the tedium of the way by



<P>trying to find out where all her money had gone to.&nbsp; So busy was

she



<P>with her card full of refractory figures that she did not observe a



<P>newcomer, who entered without stopping the vehicle, till a masculine



<P>voice said, "Good morning, Miss March," and, looking up, she beheld



<P>one of Laurie's most elegant college friends.&nbsp; Fervently hoping

that



<P>he would get out before she did, Amy utterly ignored the basket at her



<P>feet, and congratulating herself that she had on her new traveling



<P>dress, returned the young man's greeting with her usual suavity and



<P>spirit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They got on excellently, for Amy's chief care was soon set at



<P>rest by learning that the gentleman would leave first, and she was



<P>chatting away in a peculiarly lofty strain, when the old lady got out.



<P>In stumbling to the door, she upset the basket, and--oh horror!--the



<P>lobster, in all its vulgar size and brilliancy, was revealed to the



<P>highborn eyes of a Tudor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"By Jove, she's forgotten her dinner!" cried the unconscious



<P>youth, poking the scarlet monster into its place with his cane, and



<P>preparing to hand out the basket after the old lady.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Please don't--it's--it's mine," murmured Amy, with a face nearly



<P>as red as her fish.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, really, I beg pardon.&nbsp; It's an uncommonly fine one, isn't

it?"



<P>said Tudor, with great presence of mind, and an air of sober interest



<P>that did credit to his breeding.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amy recovered herself in a breath, set her basket boldly on the



<P>seat, and said, laughing, "Don't you wish you were to have some of the



<P>salad he's going to make, and to see the charming young ladies who are



<P>to eat it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now that was tact, for two of the ruling foibles of the masculine



<P>mind were touched.&nbsp; The lobster was instantly surrounded by a halo

of



<P>pleasing reminiscences, and curiosity about `the charming young ladies'



<P>diverted his mind from the comical mishap.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I suppose he'll laugh and joke over it with Laurie, but I shan't



<P>see them, that's a comfort," thought Amy, as Tudor bowed and departed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She did not mention this meeting at home (though she discovered



<P>that, thanks to the upset, her new dress was much damaged by the



<P>rivulets of dressing that meandered down the skirt), but went through



<P>with the preparations which now seemed more irksome than before, and



<P>at twelve o'clock all was ready again.&nbsp; feeling that the neighbors



<P>were interested in her movements, she wished to efface the memory of



<P>yesterday's failure by a grand success today, so she ordered the



<P>`cherry bounce', and drove away in state to meet and escort her guests



<P>to the banquet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There's the rumble, they're coming!&nbsp; I'll go onto the porch and



<P>meet them.&nbsp; It looks hospitable, and I want the poor child to have

a



<P>good time after all her trouble," said Mrs. March, suiting the action



<P>to the word.&nbsp; But after one glance, she retired, with an indescribable



<P>expression, for looking quite lost in the big carriage, sat Amy and



<P>one young lady.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Run, Beth, and help Hannah clear half the things off the table.



<P>It will be too absurd to put a luncheon for twelve before a single



<P>girl," cried Jo, hurrying away to the lower regions, too excited to



<P>stop even for a laugh.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In came Amy, quite calm and delightfully cordial to the one



<P>guest who had kept her promise.&nbsp; The rest of the family, being

of



<P>a dramatic turn, played their parts equally well, and Miss Eliott



<P>found them a most hilarious set, for it was impossible to control



<P>entirely the merriment which possessed them.&nbsp; The remodeled lunch



<P>being gaily partaken of, the studio and garden visited, and art



<P>discussed with enthusiasm, Amy ordered a buggy (alas for the elegant



<P>cherry-bounce), and drove her friend quietly about the neighborhood



<P>till sunset, when `the party went out'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As she came walking in, looking very tired but as composed as



<P>ever, she observed that every vestige of the unfortunate fete had



<P>disappeared, except a suspicious pucker about the corners of Jo's



<P>mouth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You've had a loverly afternoon for your drive, dear," said



<P>her mother, as respectfully as if the whole twelve had come.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Miss Eliott is a very sweet girl, and seemed to enjoy herself,



<P>I thought," observed Beth, with unusual warmth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Could you spare me some of your cake?&nbsp; I really need some, I



<P>have so much company, and I can't make such delicious stuff as yours,"



<P>asked Meg soberly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Take it all.&nbsp; I'm the only one here who likes sweet things, and



<P>it will mold before I can dispose of it," answered Amy, thinking with



<P>a sigh of the generous store she had laid in for such an end as this.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's a pity Laurie isn't here to help us," began Jo, as they sat



<P>down to ice cream and salad for the second time in two days.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A warning look from her mother checked any further remarks, and



<P>the whole family ate in heroic silence, till Mr. March mildly observed,



<P>"salad was one of the favorite dishes of the ancients, and Evelyn..."



<P>Here a general explosion of laughter cut short the `history of salads',



<P>to the great surprise of the learned gentleman.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Bundle everything into a basket and send it to the Hummels.&nbsp; Germans



<P>like messes.&nbsp; I'm sick of the sight of this, and there's no reason

you



<P>should all die of a surfeit because I've been a fool," cried Amy, wiping



<P>her eyes.



<P>"I thought I should have died when I saw you two girls rattling



<P>about in the what-you-call-it, like two little kernels in a very big



<P>nutshell, and Mother waiting in state to receive the throng," sighed



<P>Jo, quite spent with laughter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm very sorry you were disappointed, dear, but we all did our



<P>best to satisfy you," said Mrs. March, in a tone full of motherly



<P>regret.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am satisfied.&nbsp; I've done what I undertook, and it's not my



<P>fault that it failed.&nbsp; I comfort myself with that," said Amy with

a



<P>little quiver in her voice.&nbsp; "I thank you all very much for helping



<P>me, and I'll thank you still more if you won't allude to it for a



<P>month, at least."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>No one did for several months, but the word `fete' always produced



<P>a general smile, and Laurie's birthday gift to Amy was a tiny



<P>coral lobster in the shape of a charm for her watch guard.

<B>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fortune suddenly smiled upon Jo, and dropped a good luck



<P>penny in her path.&nbsp; Not a golden penny, exactly, but I doubt



<P>if half a million would have given more real happiness then did



<P>the little sum that came to her in this wise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Every few weeks she would shut herself up in her room, put



<P>on her scribbling suit, and `fall into a vortex', as she expressed



<P>it, writing away at her novel with all her heart and soul, for till



<P>that was finished she could find no peace.&nbsp; Her `scribbling suit'



<P>consisted of a black woolen pinafore on which she could wipe her



<P>pen at will, and a cap of the same material, adorned with a



<P>cheerful red bow, into which she bundled her hair when the decks were



<P>cleared for action.&nbsp; This cap was a beacon to the inquiring eyes

of



<P>her family, who during these periods kept their distance, merely



<P>popping in their heads semi-occasionally to ask, with interest,



<P>"Does genius burn, Jo?" They did not always venture even to ask



<P>this question, but took an observation of the cap, and judged



<P>accordingly.&nbsp; If this expressive article of dress was drawn low



<P>upon the forehead, it was a sign that hard work was going on, in



<P>exciting moments it was pushed rakishly askew, and when despair



<P>seized the author it was plucked wholly off, and cast upon the



<P>floor, and cast upon the floor.&nbsp; At such times the intruder silently



<P>withdrew, and not until the red bow was seen gaily erect upon the



<P>gifted brow, did anyone dare address Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She did not think herself a genius by any means, but when the



<P>writing fit came on, she gave herself up to it with entire abandon,



<P>and led a blissful life, unconscious of want, care, or bad weather,



<P>while she sat safe and happy in an imaginary world, full of friends



<P>almost as real and dear to her as any in the flesh.&nbsp; Sleep forsook



<P>her eyes, meals stood untasted, day and night were all too short to



<P>enjoy the happiness which blessed her only at such times, and made



<P>these hours worth living, even if they bore no other fruit.&nbsp; The



<P>devine afflatus usually lasted a week or two, and then she emerged



<P>from her `vortex', hungry, sleepy, cross, or despondent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was just recovering from one of these attacks when she was



<P>prevailed upon to escort Miss Crocker to a lecture, and in return



<P>for her virtue was rewarded with a new idea.&nbsp; It was a People's



<P>Course, the lecture on the Pyramids, and Jo rather wondered at the



<P>choice of such a subject for such an audience, but took it for



<P>granted that some great social evil would be remedied or some great

want



<P>supplied by unfolding the glories of the Pharaohs to an audience



<P>whose thoughts were busy with the price of coal and flour, and whose



<P>lives were spent in trying to solve harder riddles than that of the

Sphinx.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They were early, and while Miss Crocker set the heel of her



<P>stocking, Jo amused herself by examining the faces of the people who



<P>occupied the seat with them.&nbsp; On her left were two matrons, with



<P>massive foreheads and bonnets to match, discussing Women's Rights and



<P>making tatting.&nbsp; Beyond sat a pair of humble lovers, artlessly



<P>holding each other by the hand, a somber spinster eating peppermints

out



<P>of a paper bag, and an old gentleman taking his preparatory nap



<P>behind a yellow bandanna.&nbsp; On her right, her only neighbor was

a



<P>studious looking lad absorbed in a newspaper.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was a pictorial sheet, and Jo examined the work of art nearest



<P>her, idly wondering what fortuitous concatenation of circumstances



<P>needed the melodramatic illustration of an Indian in full war costume,



<P>tumbling over a precipice with a wolf at his throat, while two



<P>infuriated young gentlemen, with unnaturally small feet and big eyes,



<P>were stabbing each other close by, and a disheveled female was flying

away



<P>in the background with her mouth wide open.&nbsp; Pausing to turn a

page,



<P>the lad saw her looking and, with boyish good nature offered half his



<P>paper, saying bluntly, "want to read it? That's a first-rate story."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jo accepted it with a smile, for she had never outgrown her



<P>liking for lads, and soon found herself involved in the usual labyrinth



<P>of love, mystery, and murder, for the story belonged to that class of



<P>light literature in which the passions have a holiday, and when the



<P>author's invention fails, a grand catastrophe clears the stage of one



<P>half the dramatis personae, leaving the other half to exult over



<P>their downfall.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Prime, isn't it?" asked the boy, as her eye went down the last



<P>paragraph of her portion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think you and I could do as well as that if we tried,"



<P>returned Jo, amused at his admiration of the trash.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I should think I was a pretty lucky chap if I could.&nbsp; She makes



<P>a good living out of such stories, they say."&nbsp; And he pointed to

the



<P>name of Mrs. S.L.A.N.G.&nbsp; Northbury, under the title of the tale.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you know her?" asked Jo, with sudden interest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, but I read all her pieces, and I know a fellow who works in



<P>the office where this paper is printed."



<P>"Do you say she makes a good living out of stories like this?"



<P>And Jo looked more respectfully at the agitated group and thickly



<P>sprinkled exclamation points that adorned the page.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Guess she does!&nbsp; She knows just what folks like, and gets paid



<P>well for writing it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here the lecture began, but Jo heard very little of it, for while



<P>Professor Sands was prosing away about Belzoni, Cheops, scarabei, and



<P>hieroglyphics, she was covertly taking down the address of the paper,



<P>and boldly resolving to try for the hundred-dollar prize offered in



<P>its columns for a sensational story.&nbsp; By the time the lecture ended



<P>and the audience awoke, she had built up a splendid fortune for herself



<P>(not the first founded on paper), and was already deep in the



<P>concoction of her story, being unable to decide whether the duel



<P>should come before the elopement or after the murder.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>she said nothing of her plan at home, but fell to work next day,



<P>much to the disquiet of her mother, who always looked a little anxious



<P>when `genius took to burning'.&nbsp; Jo had never tried this style before,



<P>contenting herself with very mild romances for THE SPREAD EAGLE.&nbsp;

Her



<P>experience and miscellaneous reading were of service now, for they



<P>gave her some idea of dramatic effect, and supplied plot, language,



<P>and costumes.&nbsp; Her story was as full of desperation and despair

as her



<P>limited acquaintance with those uncomfortable emotions enabled her to



<P>make it, and having located it in Lisbon, she wound up with an earthquake,



<P>as a striking and appropriate denouement.&nbsp; The manuscript was



<P>privately dispatched, accompanied by a note, modestly saying that if



<P>the tale didn't get the prize, which the writer hardly dared expect,



<P>she would be very glad to receive any sum it might be considered worth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Six weeks is a long time to wait, and a still longer time for



<P>a girl to keep a secret, but Jo did both, and was just beginning



<P>to give up all hope of ever seeing her manuscript again,



<P>when a letter arrived which almost took her breath away, for on



<P>opening it, a check for a hundred dollars fell into her lap.&nbsp; For



<P>a minute she stared at it as if it had been a snake, then she read



<P>her letter and began to cry.&nbsp; If the amiable gentleman who wrote



<P>that kindly note could have known what intense happiness he was



<P>giving a fellow creature, I think he would devote his leisure hours,



<P>if he has any, to that amusement, for Jo valued the letter more than



<P>the money, because it was encouraging, and after years of effort it



<P>was so pleasant to find that she had learned to do something, though



<P>it was only to write a sensation story.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A prouder young woman was seldom seen than she, when, having



<P>composed herself, she electrified the family by appearing before them



<P>with the letter in one hand, the check in the other, announcing that



<P>she had won the prize.&nbsp; Of course there was a great jubilee, and

when



<P>the story came everyone read and praised it, though after her father



<P>had told her that the language was good, the romance fresh and hearty,



<P>and the tragedy quite thrilling, he shook his head, and said in his



<P>unworldly way...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You can do better than this, Jo.&nbsp; Aim at the highest, and never



<P>mind the money."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think the money is the best part of it.&nbsp; What will you do with



<P>such a fortune?" asked Amy, regarding the magic slip of paper with a



<P>reverential eye.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Send Beth and Mother to the seaside for a month or two," answered



<P>Jo promptly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To the seaside they went, after much discussion, and though Beth



<P>didn't come home as plump and rosy as could be desired, she was much



<P>better, while Mrs. March declared she felt ten years younger.&nbsp;

So Jo



<P>was satisfied with the investment of her prize money, and fell to work



<P>with a cheery spirit, bent on earning more of those delightful checks.



<P>She did earn several that year, and began to feel herself a power



<P>in the house, for by the magic of a pen, her `rubbish' turned into



<P>comforts for them all.&nbsp; The Duke's Daughter paid the butcher's

bill,



<P>A Phantom Hand put down a new carpet, and the Curse of the Coventrys



<P>proved the blessing of the Marches in the way of groceries and gowns.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Wealth is certainly a most desirable thing, but poverty has its



<P>sunny side, and one of the sweet uses of adversity is the genuine



<P>satisfaction which comes from hearty work of head or hand, and to the



<P>inspiration of necessity, we owe half the wise, beautiful, and useful



<P>blessings of the world.&nbsp; Jo enjoyed a taste of this satisfaction,



<P>and ceased to envy richer girls, taking great comfort in the knowledge



<P>that she could supply her own wants, and need ask no one for a penny.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Little notice was taken of her stories, but they found a market,



<P>and encouraged by this fact, she resolved to make a bold stroke for



<P>fame and fortune.&nbsp; Having copied her novel for the fourth time,

read



<P>it to all her confidential friends, and submitted it with fear and



<P>trembling to three publishers, she at last disposed of it, on condition



<P>that she would cut it down one third, and omit all the parts



<P>which she particularly admired.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now I must either bundle it back in to my tin kitchen to mold,



<P>pay for printing it myself, or chop it up to suit purchasers and get



<P>what I can for it.&nbsp; Fame is a very good thing to have in the house,



<P>but cash is more convenient, so I wish to take the sense of the meeting



<P>on this important subject," said Jo, calling a family council.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't spoil your book, my girl, for there is more in it than



<P>you know, and the idea is well worked out.&nbsp; Let it wait and ripen,"



<P>was her father's advice, and he practiced what he preached, having



<P>waited patiently thirty years for fruit of his own to ripen, and



<P>being in no haste to gather it even now when it was sweet and mellow.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It seems to me that Jo will profit more by taking the trial



<P>than by waiting," said Mrs. March.&nbsp; "Criticism is the best test

of



<P>such work, for it will show her both unsuspected merits and faults,



<P>and help her to do better next time.&nbsp; We are too partial, but the



<P>praise and blame of outsiders will prove useful, even if she gets



<P>but little money."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," said Jo, knitting her brows, "that's just it.&nbsp; I've been



<P>fussing over the thing so long, I really don't know whether it's good,



<P>bad, or indifferent.&nbsp; It will be a great help to have cool, impartial



<P>persons take a look at it, and tell me what they think of it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wouldn't leave a word out of it.&nbsp; You'll spoil it if you do,



<P>for the interest of the story is more in the minds than in the actions



<P>of the people, and it will be all a muddle if you don't explain as you



<P>go on," said Meg, who firmly believed that this book was the most



<P>remarkable novel ever written.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But Mr. Allen says, `Leave out the explanations, make it brief



<P>and dramatic, and let the characters tell the story'," interrupted



<P>Jo, turning to the publisher's note.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do as he tells you.&nbsp; He knows what will sale, and we don't.



<P>Make a good, popular book, and get as much money as you can.



<P>By-and-by, when you've got a name, you can afford to digress,



<P>and have philosophical and metaphysical people in your novels,"



<P>said Amy, who took a strictly practical view of the subject.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well," said Jo, laughing, "if my people are `philosophical and



<P>metaphysical', it isn't my fault, for I know nothing about such



<P>things, except what I hear father say;, sometimes.&nbsp; If I've got

some



<P>of his wise ideas jumbled up with my romance, so much the better for



<P>me.&nbsp; Now, Beth, what do you say?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I should so like to see it printed soon," was all Beth said,



<P>and smiled in saying it.&nbsp; But there was an unconscious emphasis

on



<P>the last word, and a wistful look in the eyes that never lost their



<P>childlike candor, which chilled Jo's heart for a minute with a



<P>forboding fear, and decided her to make her little venture `soon'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So, with Spartan firmness, the young authoress laid her first-born



<P>on her table, and chopped it up as ruthlessly as any ogre.&nbsp; In

the hope



<P>of pleasing everyone, she took everyone's advice, and like the old man



<P>and his donkey in the fable suited nobody.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her father liked the metaphysical streak which had unconsciously



<P>got into it, so that was allowed to remain though she had her



<P>doubts about it.&nbsp; Her mother thought that there was a trifle too

much



<P>description.&nbsp; Out, therefore it came, and with it many necessary



<P>links in the story.&nbsp; Meg admired the tragedy, so Jo piled up the



<P>agony to suit her, while Amy objected to the fun, and, with the



<P>best intentions in life, Jo quenched the spritly scenes which



<P>relieved the somber character of the story.&nbsp; Then, to complicate



<P>the ruin, she cut it down one third, and confidingly sent the



<P>poor little romance, like a picked robin, out into the big, busy



<P>world to try its fate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well, it was printed, and she got three hundred dollars for



<P>it, likewise plenty of praise and blame, both so much greater than



<P>she expected that she was thrown into a state of bewilderment from



<P>which it took her some time to recover.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You said, Mother, that criticism would help me.&nbsp; But how can



<P>it, when it's so contradictory that I don't know whether I've written



<P>a promising book or broken all the ten commandments?" cried poor



<P>Jo, turning over a heap of notices, the perusal of which filled her



<P>with pride and joy one minute, wrath and dismay the next.&nbsp; "This



<P>man says, `An exquisite book, full of truth, beauty, and earnestness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>All is sweet, pure, and healthy.'" continued the perplexed



<P>authoress.&nbsp; "The next, `The theory of the book is bad, full of



<P>morbid fancies, spiritualistic ideas, and unnatural characters.'



<P>Now, as I had no theory of any kind, don't believe in Spiritualism,



<P>and copied my characters from life, I don't see how this critic can



<P>be right.&nbsp; Another says, `It's one of the best American novels

which



<P>has appeared for years.' (I know better than that), and the next



<P>asserts that `Though it is original, and written with great force



<P>and feeling, it is a dangerous book.' 'Tisn't!&nbsp; Some make fun of

it,



<P>some overpraise, and nearly all insist that I had a deep theory to



<P>expound, when I only wrote it for the pleasure and the money.&nbsp;

I



<P>wish I'd printed the whole or not at all, for I do hate to be so



<P>misjudged."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her family and friends administered comfort and commendation



<P>liberally.&nbsp; Yet it was a hard time for sensitive, high-spirited

Jo,



<P>who meant so well and had apparently done so ill.&nbsp; But it did her



<P>good, for those whose opinion had real value gave her the critism



<P>which is an author's best education, and when the first soreness



<P>was over, she could laugh at her poor little book, yet believe in



<P>it still, and feel herself the wiser and stronger for the buffeting



<P>she had received.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not being a genius, like Keats, it won't kill me," she said



<P>stoutly, "and I've got the joke on my side, after all, for the parts



<P>that were taken straight out of real life are denounced as impossible



<P>and absurd, and the scenes that I made up out of my own silly head



<P>are pronounced `charmingly natural, tender, and true'.&nbsp; So I'll



<P>comfort myself with that, and when I'm ready, I'll up again and take



<P>another."

<P>New York, November

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Dear Marmee and Beth,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I'm going to write you a regular volume, for I've got heaps



<P>to tell, though I'm not a fine young lady traveling on the continent.



<P>When I lost sight of Father's dear old face, I felt a



<P>trifle blue, and might have shed a briny drop or two, if an



<P>Irish lady with four small children, all crying more or less,



<P>hadn't diverted my mind, for I amused myself by dropping gingerbread



<P>nuts over the seat every time they opened their mouths to roar.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Soon the sun came out, and taking it as a good omen, I



<P>cleared up likewise and enjoyed my journey with all my heart.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Kirke welcomed me so kindly I felt at home at once,



<P>even in that big house full of strangers.&nbsp; She gave me a funny



<P>little sky parlor--all she had, but there is a stove in it, and a



<P>nice table in a sunny window, so I can sit here and write whenever



<P>I like.&nbsp; A fine view and a church tower opposite atone for



<P>the many stairs, and I took a fancy to my den on the spot.



<P>The nursery, where I am to teach and sew, is a pleasant room next



<P>Mrs. Kirke's private parlor, and the two little girls are pretty



<P>children, rather spoiled, I fancy, but they took to me after



<P>telling them The Seven Bad Pigs, and I've no doubt I shall make



<P>a model governess.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I am to have my meals with the children, if I prefer it to



<P>the great table, and for the present I do, for I am bashful,



<P>though no one will believe it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now, my dear, make yourself at home," said Mrs. K.&nbsp; in her



<P>motherly way, "I'm on the drive from morning to night, as you



<P>may suppose with such a family, but a great anxiety will be off



<P>my mind if I know the children are safe with you.&nbsp; My rooms are



<P>always open to you, and your own shall be as comfortable as I



<P>can make it.&nbsp; There are some pleasant people in the house if you



<P>feel sociable, and your evenings are always free.&nbsp; Come to me



<P>if anything goes wrong, and be as happy as you can.&nbsp; There's the



<P>tea bell, I must run and change my cap."&nbsp; And off she bustled,



<P>leaving me to settle myself in my new nest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As I went downstairs soon after, I saw something I liked.



<P>The flights are very long in this tall house, and as I stood



<P>waiting at the head of the third one for a little servant girl



<P>to lumber up, I saw a gentleman come along behind her, take the



<P>heavy hod of coal out of her hand, carry it all the way up, put



<P>it down at a door near by, and walk away, saying, with a kind



<P>nod and a foreign accent, "It goes better so.&nbsp; The little back



<P>is too young to haf such heaviness."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Wasn't it good of him?&nbsp; I like such things, for as Father



<P>says, trifles show character.&nbsp; When I mentioned it to Mrs. K.,



<P>that evening, she laughed, and said, "That must have been



<P>Professor Bhaer, he's always doing things of that sort."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. K.&nbsp; told me he was from Berlin, very learned and good,



<P>but poor as a church mouse, and gives lessons to support himself



<P>and two little orphan nephews whom he is educating here, according



<P>to the wishes of his sister, who married an American.&nbsp; Not



<P>a very romantic story, but it interested me, and I was glad to



<P>hear that Mrs. K.&nbsp; lends him her parlor for some of his scholars.



<P>There is a glass door between it and the nursery, and I mean to



<P>peep at him, and then I'll tell you how he looks.&nbsp; He's almost



<P>forty, so it's no harm, Marmee.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After tea and a go-to-bed romp with the little girls, I



<P>attacked the big workbasket, and had a quiet evening chatting



<P>with my new friend.&nbsp; I shall keep a journal-letter, and send it



<P>once a week, so goodnight, and more tomorrow.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Tuesday Eve

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Had a lively time in my seminary this morning, for the



<P>children acted like Sancho, and at one time I really thought I



<P>should shake them all round.&nbsp; Some good angel inspired me to



<P>try gymnastics, and I kept it up till they were glad to sit down



<P>and keep still.&nbsp; After luncheon, the girl took them out for a



<P>walk, and I went to my needlework like little Mabel `with a



<P>willing mind'.&nbsp; I was thanking my stars that I'd learned to



<P>make nice buttonholes, when the parlor door opened and shut,



<P>and someone began to hum, Kennst Du Das Land, like a big bumblebee.



<P>It was dreadfully improper, I know, but I couldn't



<P>resist the temptation, and lifting one end of the curtain



<P>before the glass door, I peeped in.&nbsp; Professor Bhaer was there,



<P>and while he arranged his books, I took a good look at him.&nbsp; A



<P>regular German--rather stout, with brown hair tumbled all over



<P>his head, a bushy beard, good nose, the kindest eyes I ever



<P>saw, and a splendid big voice that does one's ears good, after



<P>our sharp or slipshod American gabble.&nbsp; His clothes were rusty,



<P>his hands were large, and he hadn't a really handsome feature



<P>in his face, except his beautiful teeth, yet I liked him, for



<P>he had a fine head, his linen was very nice, and he looked



<P>like a gentleman, though two buttons were off his coat and



<P>there was a patch on one shoe.&nbsp; He looked sober in spite of



<P>his humming, till he went to the window to turn the hyacinth



<P>bulbs toward the sun, and stroke the cat, who received him



<P>like an old friend.&nbsp; Then he smiled, and when a tap came at



<P>the door, called out in a loud, brisk tone, "Herein!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I was just going to run, when I caught sight of a morsel of



<P>a child carrying a big book, and stopped, to see what was going



<P>on.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Me wants me Bhaer," said the mite, slamming down her book



<P>and running to meet him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thou shalt haf thy Bhaer.&nbsp; Come, then, and take a goot



<P>hug from him, my Tina," said the Professor, catching her up



<P>with a laugh, and holding her so high over his head that she



<P>had to stoop her little face to kiss him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now me mus tuddy my lessin," went on the funny little



<P>thing.&nbsp; So he put her up at the table, opened the great dictionary



<P>she had brought, and gave her a paper and pencil, and



<P>she scribbled away, turning a leaf now and then, and passing



<P>her little fat finger down the page, as if finding a word,



<P>so soberly that I nearly betrayed myself by a laugh, while



<P>Mr. Bhaer stood stroking her pretty hair with a fatherly look



<P>that made me think she must be his own, though she looked more



<P>French than German.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Another knock and the appearance of two young ladies sent



<P>me back to my work, and there I virtuously remained through all



<P>the noise and gabbling that went on next door.&nbsp; One of the girls



<P>kept laughing affectedly, and saying, "Now Professor," in a



<P>coquettish tone, and the other pronounced her German with an



<P>accent that must have made it hard for him to keep sober.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Both seemed to try his patience sorely, for more than once



<P>I heard him say emphatically, "No, no, it is not so, you haf



<P>not attend to what I say," and once there was a loud rap, as



<P>if he struck the table with his book, followed by the despairing



<P>exclamation, "Prut!&nbsp; It all goes bad this day."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Poor man, I pitied him, and when the girls were gone, took



<P>just one more peep to see if he survived it.&nbsp; He seemed to have



<P>thrown himself back in his chair, tired out, and sat there with



<P>his eyes shut till the clock struck two, when he jumped up, put



<P>his books in his pocket, as if ready for another lesson, and



<P>taking little Tina who had fallen asleep on the sofa in his



<P>arms, he carried her quietly away.&nbsp; I fancy he has a hard life



<P>of it.&nbsp; Mrs. Kirke asked me if I wouldn't go down to the five



<P>o'clock dinner, and feeling a little bit homesick, I thought



<P>I would, just to see what sort of people are under the same



<P>roof with me.&nbsp; So I made myself respectable and tried to slip



<P>in behind Mrs. Kirke, but as she is short and I'm tall, my



<P>efforts at concealment were rather a failure.&nbsp; She gave me a



<P>seat by her, and after my face cooled off, I plucked up courage



<P>and looked about me.&nbsp; The long table was full, and every--



<P>one intent on getting their dinner, the gentlemen especially,



<P>who seemed to be eating on time, for they bolted in every



<P>sense of the word, vanishing as soon as they were done.&nbsp; There



<P>was the usual assortment of young men absorbed in themselves,



<P>young couples absorbed in each other, married ladies in their



<P>babies, and old gentlemen in politics.&nbsp; I don't think I shall



<P>care to have much to do with any of them, except one sweetfaced



<P>maiden lady, who looks as if she had something in her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Cast away at the very bottom of the table was the Professor,



<P>shouting answers to the questions of a very inquisitive,



<P>deaf old gentleman on one side, and talking philosophy with



<P>a Frenchman on the other.&nbsp; If Amy had been here, she'd have



<P>turned her back on him forever because, sad to relate, he had



<P>a great appetite, and shoveled in his dinner in a manner which



<P>would have horrified `her ladyship'.&nbsp; I didn't mind, for I like



<P>`to see folks eat with a relish', as Hannah says, and the poor



<P>man must have needed a deal of food after teaching idiots all day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As I went upstairs after dinner, two of the young men



<P>were settling their hats before the hall mirror, and I heard



<P>one say low to the other, "Who's the new party?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Governess, or something of that sort."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What the deuce is she at our table for?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Friend of the old lady's."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Handsome head, but no style."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not a bit of it.&nbsp; Give us a light and come on."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I felt angry at first, and then I didn't care, for a governess



<P>is as good as a clerk, and I've got sense, if I haven't



<P>style, which is more than some people have, judging from the



<P>remarks of the elegant beings who clattered away, smoking like



<P>bad chimneys.&nbsp; I hate ordinary people!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Thursday

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Yesterday was a quiet day spent in teaching, sewing, and



<P>writing in my little room, which is very cozy, with a light and



<P>fire.&nbsp; I picked up a few bits of news and was introduced to the



<P>Professor.&nbsp; It seems that Tina is the child of the Frenchwoman



<P>who does the fine ironing in the laundry here.&nbsp; The little thing



<P>has lost her heart to Mr. Bhaer, and follows him about the house



<P>like a dog whenever he is at home, which delights him, as he is



<P>very fond of children, though a `bacheldore'.&nbsp; Kitty and Minnie



<P>Kirk likewise regard him with affection, and tell all sorts of



<P>stories about the plays he invents, the presents he brings, and



<P>the splendid tales he tells.&nbsp; The younger men quiz him, it seems,



<P>call him Old Fritz, Lager Beer, Ursa Major, and make all manner



<P>of jokes on his name.&nbsp; But he enjoys it like a boy, Mrs. Kirke



<P>says, and takes it so good-naturedly that they all like him in



<P>spite of his foreign ways.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The maiden lady is a Miss Norton, rich, cultivated, and



<P>kind.&nbsp; She spoke to me at dinner today (for I went to table



<P>again, it's such fun to watch people), and asked me to come



<P>and see her at her room.&nbsp; She has fine books and pictures,



<P>knows interesting persons, and seems friendly, so I shall make



<P>myself agreeable, for I do want to get into good society, only



<P>it isn't the same sort that Amy likes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I was in our parlor last evening when Mr. Bhaer came in



<P>with some newspapers for Mrs. Kirke.&nbsp; She wasn't there, but



<P>Minnie, who is a little old woman, introduced me very prettily.



<P>"This is Mamma's friend, Miss March."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, and she's jolly and we like her lots," added Kitty,



<P>who is and `enfant terrible'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>We both bowed, and then we laughed, for the prim introduction



<P>and the blunt addition were rather a comical contrast.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, yes, I hear these naughty ones go to vex you, Mees



<P>Marsch.&nbsp; If so again, call at me and I come," he said, with a



<P>threatening frown that delighted the little wretches.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I promised I would, and he departed, but it seems as if I



<P>was doomed to see a good deal of him, for today as I passed



<P>his door on my way out, by accident I knocked against it with



<P>my umbrella.&nbsp; It flew open, and there he stood in his dressing



<P>gown, with a big blue sock on one hand and a darning needle



<P>in the other.&nbsp; He didn't seem at all ashamed of it, for when



<P>I explained and hurried on, he waved his hand, sock and all,



<P>saying in his loud, cheerful way...

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You haf a fine day to make your walk.&nbsp; Bon voyage, Mademoiselle."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I laughed all the way downstairs, but it was a little pathetic,



<P>also to think of the poor man having to mend his own clothes.



<P>The German gentlemen embroider, I know, but darning hose is



<P>another thing and not so pretty.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nothing has happened to write about, except a call on Miss



<P>Norton, who has a room full of pretty things, and who was very



<P>charming, for she showed me all her treasures, and asked me if



<P>I would sometimes go with her to lectures and concerts, as her



<P>escort, if I enjoyed them.&nbsp; She put it as a favor, but I'm sure



<P>Mrs. Kirke has told her about us, and she does it out of kindness



<P>to me.&nbsp; I'm as proud as Lucifer, but such favors from such



<P>people don't burden me, and I accepted gratefully.



<P>When I got back to the nursery there was such an uproar



<P>in the parlor that I looked in, and there was Mr. Bhaer down



<P>on his hands and knees, with Tina on his back, Kitty leading



<P>him with a jump rope, and Minnie feeding two small boys with



<P>seedcakes, as they roared and ramped in cages built of chairs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We are playing nargerie," explained Kitty.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dis is mine effalunt!" added Tina, holding on by the



<P>Professor's hair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mamma always allows us to do what we like Saturday afternoon,



<P>when Franz and Emil come, doesn't she, Mr. Bhaer?"



<P>said Minnie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The `effalunt' sat up, looking as much in earnest as any



<P>of them, and said soberly to me, "I gif you my wort it is so,



<P>if we make too large a noise you shall say Hush! to us, and we



<P>go more softly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I promised to do so, but left the door open and enjoyed the



<P>fun as much as they did, for a more glorious frolic I never



<P>witnessed.&nbsp; They played tag and soldiers, danced and sang,



<P>and when it began to grow dark they all piled onto the sofa about



<P>the Professor, while he told charming fairy stories of the storks



<P>on the chimney tops, and the little `koblods', who ride the



<P>snowflakes as they fall.&nbsp; I wish Americans were as simple and



<P>natural as Germans, don't you?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I'm so fond of writing, I should go spinning on forever if



<P>motives of economy didn't stop me, for though I've used thin



<P>paper and written fine, I tremble to think of the stamps this



<P>long letter will need.&nbsp; Pray forward Amy's as soon as you can



<P>spare them.&nbsp; My small news will sound very flat after her



<P>splendors, but you will like them, I know.&nbsp; Is Teddy studying



<P>so hard that he can't find time to write to his friends?&nbsp; Take



<P>good care of him for me, Beth, and tell me all about the babies,



<P>and give heaps of love to everyone.&nbsp; From your faithful Jo.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>P.S.&nbsp; On reading over my letter, it strikes me as rather



<P>Bhaery, but I am always interested in odd people, and I really



<P>had nothing else to write about.&nbsp; Bless you!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>DECEMBER

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>My Precious Betsey,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As this is to be a scribble-scrabble letter, I direct it to



<P>you, for it may amuse you, and give you some idea of my goings



<P>on, for though quiet, they are rather amusing, for which, oh,



<P>be joyful!&nbsp; After what Amy would call Herculaneum efforts, in



<P>the way of mental and moral agriculture, my young ideas begin



<P>to shoot and my little twigs to bend as I could wish.&nbsp; They are



<P>not so interesting tome as Tina and the boys, but I do my duty



<P>by them, and they are fond of me.&nbsp; Franz and Emil are jolly



<P>little lads, quite after my own heart, for the mixture of



<P>German and American spirit in the produces a constant state of



<P>effervescence.&nbsp; Saturday afternoons are riotous times, whether



<P>spent in the house or out, for on pleasant days they all go to



<P>walk, like a seminary, with the Professor and myself to keep



<P>order, and then such fun!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>We are very good friends now, and I've begun to take



<P>lessons.&nbsp; I really couldn't help it, and it all came about in



<P>such a droll way that I must tell you.&nbsp; To begin at the beginning,



<P>Mrs. Kirke called to me one day as I passed Mr. Bhaer's room



<P>where she was rummaging.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Did you ever see such a den, my dear?&nbsp; Just come and



<P>help me put these books to rights, for I've turned everything



<P>upside down, trying to discover what he has done with the six



<P>new handkerchiefs I gave him not long ago."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I went in, and while we worked I looked about me, for it



<P>was `a den' to be sure.&nbsp; Books and papers everywhere, a broken



<P>meerschaum, and an old flute over the mantlepiece as if done



<P>with, a ragged bird without any tail chirped on one window



<P>seat, and a box of white mice adorned the other.&nbsp; Half-finished



<P>boats and bits of string lay among the manuscripts.&nbsp; Dirty



<P>little boots stood drying before the fire, and traces of the



<P>dearly beloved boys, for whom he makes a slave of himself,



<P>were to be seen all over the room.&nbsp; After a grand rummage



<P>three of the missing articles were found, one over the bird



<P>cage, one covered with ink, and a third burned brown, having



<P>been used as a holder.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Such a man!" laughed good-natured Mrs. K., as she put the



<P>relics in the rag bay.&nbsp; "I suppose the others are torn up to



<P>rig ships, bandage cut fingers, or make kite tails.&nbsp; It's dreadful,



<P>but I can't scold him.&nbsp; He's so absent-minded and goodnatured,



<P>he lets those boys ride over him roughshod.&nbsp; I agreed to do



<P>his washing and mending, but he forgets to give out his things



<P>and I forget to look them over, so he comes to a sad pass sometimes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Let me mend them," said I.&nbsp; "I don't mind it, and he needn't



<P>know.&nbsp; I'd like to, he's so kind to me about bringing my letters



<P>and lending books."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So I have got his things in order, and knit heels into two



<P>pairs of the socks, for they were boggled out of shape with his



<P>queer darns.&nbsp; Nothing was said, and I hoped he wouldn't find it



<P>out, but one day last week he caught me at it.&nbsp; Hearing the



<P>lessons he gives to others has interested and amused me so much



<P>that I took a fancy to lear, for Tina runs in and out, leaving



<P>the door open, and I can hear.&nbsp; I had been sitting near this



<P>door, finishing off the last sock, and trying to understand what



<P>he said to a new scholar, who is as stupid as I am.&nbsp; The girl



<P>had gone, and I thought he had also, it was so still, and I was



<P>busily gabbling over a verb, and rocking to and fro in a most



<P>absurd way, when a little crow made me look up, and there was



<P>Mr. Bhaer looking and laughing quietly, while he made signs to



<P>Tina not to betray him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So!" he said, as I stopped and stared like a goose, "you



<P>peep at me, I peep at you, and this is not bad, but see, I am



<P>not pleasanting when I say, haf you a wish for German?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, but you are too busy.&nbsp; I am too stupid to learn," I



<P>blundered out, as red as a peony.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Prut!&nbsp; We will make the time, and we fail not to find the



<P>sense.&nbsp; At efening I shall gif a little lesson with much gladness,



<P>for look you, Mees Marsch, I haf this debt to pay."&nbsp; And



<P>he pointed to my work `Yes, ' they say to one another, these so



<P>kind ladies, `he is a stupid old fellow, he will see not what we



<P>do, he will never observe that his sock heels go not in holes



<P>any more, he will think his buttons grow out new when they fall,



<P>and believe that strings make theirselves.' "Ah!&nbsp; But I haf an



<P>eye, and I see much.&nbsp; I haf a heart, and I feel thanks for this.



<P>Come, a little lesson then and now, or no more good fairy works



<P>for me and mine."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Of course I couldn't say anything after that, and as it



<P>really is a splendid opportunity, I made the bargain, and we



<P>began.&nbsp; I took four lessons, and then I stuck fast in a grammatical



<P>bog.&nbsp; The Professor was very patient with me, but it must



<P>have been torment to him, and now and then he'd look at me



<P>with such an expression of mild despair that it was a toss-up



<P>with me whether to laugh or cry.&nbsp; I tried both ways, and when



<P>it came to a sniff or utter mortification and woe, he just



<P>threw the grammar on to the floor and marched out of the room.



<P>I felt myself disgraced and deserted forever, but didn't blame



<P>him a particle, and was scrambling my papers together, meaning



<P>to rush upstairs and shake myself hard, when in he came, as



<P>brisk and beaming as if I'd covered myself in glory.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now we shall try a new way.&nbsp; You and I will read these



<P>pleasant little MARCHEN together, and dig no more in that dry



<P>book, that goes in the corner for making us trouble."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He spoke so kindly, and opened Hans Andersons's fairy



<P>tales so invitingly before me, that I was more ashamed than



<P>ever, and went at my lesson in a neck-or-nothing style that



<P>seemed to amuse him immensely.&nbsp; I forgot my bashfulness, and



<P>pegged away (no other word will express it) with all my might,



<P>tumbling over long words, pronouncing according to inspiration



<P>of the minute, and doing my very best.&nbsp; When I finished reading



<P>my first page, and stopped for breath, he clapped his hands and



<P>cried out in his hearty way, "Das ist gut!' Now we go well!&nbsp; My



<P>turn.&nbsp; I do him in German, gif me your ear."&nbsp; And away he

went,



<P>rumbling out the words with his strong voice and a relish which



<P>was good to see as well as hear.&nbsp; Fortunately the story was the



<P>CONSTANT TIN SOLDIER, which is droll, you know, so I could laugh,



<P>and I did, though I didn't understand half he read, for I couldn't



<P>help it, he was so earnest, I so excited, and the whole thing so



<P>comical.



<P>After that we got on better, and now I read my lessons



<P>pretty well, for this way of studying suits me, and I can see



<P>that the grammar gets tucked into the tales and poetry as one



<P>gives pills in jelly.&nbsp; I like it very much, and he doesn't seem



<P>tired of it yet, which is very good of him, isn't it?&nbsp; I mean



<P>to give him something on Christmas, for I dare not offer money.



<P>Tell me something nice, Marmee.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I'm glad Laurie seems so happy and busy, that he has given



<P>up smoking and lets his hair grow.&nbsp; You see Beth manages him



<P>better than I did.&nbsp; I'm not jealous, dear, do your best, only



<P>don't make a saint of him.&nbsp; I'm afraid I couldn't like him



<P>without a spice of human naughtiness.&nbsp; Read him bits of my



<P>letters.&nbsp; I haven't time to write much, and that will do just



<P>as well.&nbsp; Thank Heaven Beth continues so comfortable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>JANUARY

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A Happy New Year to you all, my dearest family, which of



<P>course includes Mr. L.&nbsp; and a young man by the name of Teddy.



<P>I can't tell you how much I enjoyed your Christmas bundle,



<P>for i didn't get it till night and had given up hoping.&nbsp; Your



<P>letter came in the morning, but you said nothing about a



<P>parcel, meaning it for a surprise, so I was disappointed,



<P>for I'd had a `kind of feeling' that you wouldn't forget me.



<P>I felt a little low in my mind as I sat up in my room after



<P>tea, and when the big, muddy, battered-looking bundle was



<P>brought to me, I just hugged it and pranced.&nbsp; It was so



<P>homey and refreshing that I sat down on the floor and read



<P>and looked and ate and laughed and cried, in my usual absurd



<P>way.&nbsp; The things were just what I wanted, and all the better



<P>for being made instead of bought.&nbsp; Beth's new `ink bib' was



<P>capital, and Hannah's box of hard gingerbread will be a



<P>treasure.&nbsp; I'll be sure and wear the nice flannels you sent,



<P>Marmee, and read carefully the books Father has marked.&nbsp; Thank



<P>you all, heaps and heaps!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Speaking of books reminds me that I'm getting rich in that



<P>line, for on New Year's Day Mr. Bhaer gave me a fine Shakespeare.



<P>It is one he values much, and I've often admired it,



<P>set up in the place of honor with his German Bible, Plato,



<P>Homer, and Milton, so you may imagine how I felt when he brought



<P>it down, without its cover, and showed me my own name in it,



<P>"from my friend Friedrich Bhaer".

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You say often you wish a library.&nbsp; Here I gif you one, for



<P>between these lids (he meant covers) is many books in one.&nbsp; Read



<P>him well, and he will help you much, for the study of character



<P>in this book will help you to read it in the world and paint it



<P>with your pen."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I thanked him as well as I could, and talk now about `my



<P>library', as if I had a hundred books.&nbsp; I never knew how much



<P>there was in Shakespeare before, but then I never had a Bhaer



<P>to explain it to me.&nbsp; Now don't laugh at his horrid name.&nbsp;

It



<P>isn't pronounced either Bear or Beer, as people will say it,



<P>but something between the two, as only Germans can give it.



<P>I'm glad you both like what I tell you about him, and hope you



<P>will know him some day.&nbsp; Mother would admire his warm heart,



<P>Father his wise head.&nbsp; I admire both, and feel rich in my new



<P>`friend Friedrich Bhaer'.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Not having much money, or knowing what he'd like, I got



<P>several little things, and put them about the room, where he



<P>would find them unexpectedly.&nbsp; They were useful, pretty, or



<P>funny, a new standish on his table, a little vase for his



<P>flower, he always has one, or a bit of green in a glass, to



<P>keep him fresh, he says, and a holder for his blower, so



<P>that he needn't burn up what Amy calls `mouchoirs'.&nbsp; I made



<P>it like those Beth invented, a big butterfly with a fat body,



<P>and black and yellow wings, worsted feelers, and bead eyes.



<P>It took his fancy immensely, and he put it on his mantlepiece



<P>as an article of virtue, so it was rather a failure after all.



<P>Poor as he is, he didn't forget a servant or a child in the



<P>house, and not a soul here, from the French laundrywoman to



<P>Miss Norton forgot him.&nbsp; I was so glad of that.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They got up a masquerade, and had a gay time New Year's



<P>Eve.&nbsp; I didn't mean to go down, having no dress.&nbsp; But at the



<P>last minute, Mrs. Kirke remembered some old brocades, and Miss



<P>Norton lent me lace and feathers.&nbsp; So I dressed up as Mrs.



<P>Malaprop, and sailed in with a mask on.&nbsp; No one knew me, for I



<P>disguised my voice, and no one dreamed of the silent, haughty



<P>Miss March (for they think I am very stiff and cool, most of



<P>them, and so I am to whippersnappers) could dance and dress,



<P>and burst out into a `nice derangement of epitaphs, like an



<P>allegory on the banks of the Nile'.&nbsp; I enjoyed it very much,



<P>and when we unmasked it was fun to see them stare at me.&nbsp; I



<P>heard one of the young men tell another that he knew I'd been



<P>an actress, in fact, he thought he remembered seeing me at



<P>one of the minor theaters.&nbsp; Meg will relish that joke.&nbsp; Mr.



<P>Bhaer was Nick Bottom, and Tina was Titania, a perfect little



<P>fairy in his arms.&nbsp; To see them dance was `quite a landscape',



<P>to use a Teddyism.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I had a very happy New Year, after all, and when I thought



<P>it over in my room, I felt as if I was getting on a little in



<P>spite of my many failures, for I'm cheerful all the time now,



<P>work with a will, and take more interest in other people than



<P>I used to, which is satisfactory.&nbsp; Bless you all!&nbsp; Ever your



<P>loving...&nbsp; Jo
