PART VIII







RELIGIOUS DEVELOPMENT







CHAPTER LVIII







EARLY IMPRESSIONS--1832-1851







When the colonists from New England came into central and western



New York, at the end of the eighteenth century, they wrote their



main ideas large upon the towns they founded. Especially was this



evident at my birthplace on the head waters of the Susquehanna.



In the heart of the little village they laid out, largely and



liberally, "the Green"; across the middle of this there gradually



rose a line of wooden structures as stately as they knew how to



make them,--the orthodox Congregational church standing at the



center; close beside this church stood the "academy"; and then,



on either side, the churches of the Baptists, Methodists, and



Episcopalians. Thus were represented religion, education, and



church equality.







The Episcopal church, as belonging to the least numerous



congregation, was at the extreme left, and the smallest building



of all. It was easily recognized. All the others were in a sort



of quasi-Italian style of the seventeenth century, like those



commonly found in New England; but this was in a kind of



"carpenter's Gothic" which had grown out of vague recollections



of the mother-country. To this building I was taken for baptism,



and with it are connected my first recollections of public



worship. My parents were very devoted members of the Protestant



Episcopal Church. With a small number of others of like mind,



they had taken refuge in it from the storms of fanaticism which



swept through western New York during the early years of the



nineteenth century. For that was the time of great "revivals."



The tremendous assertions of Jonathan Edwards regarding the



tyranny of God, having been taken up by a multitude of men who



were infinitely Edwards's inferiors in everything save



lung-power, were spread with much din through many churches:



pictures of an angry Moloch holding over the infernal fires the



creatures whom he had predestined to rebel, and the statement



that "hell is filled with infants not a span long," were among



the choice oratorical outgrowths of this period. With these loud



and lurid utterances went strivings after sacerdotal rule. The



presbyter--"old priest writ large"--took high ground in all these



villages: the simplest and most harmless amusements were



denounced, and church members guilty of taking part in them were



obliged to stand in the broad aisle and be publicly reprimanded



from the pulpit.







My mother was thoughtful, gentle, and kindly; in the midst of all



this froth and fury some one lent her a prayer-book; this led her



to join in the devotions of a little knot of people who had been



brought up to use it; and among these she found peace. My father,



who was a man of great energy and vigor, was attracted to this



little company; and not long afterward rose the little church on



the Green, served at first by such clergymen as chanced to be in



that part of the State.







Among these was a recent graduate of the Episcopal College at



Geneva on Seneca Lake--Henry Gregory. His seemed to be a soul



which by some mistake had escaped out of the thirteenth century



into the nineteenth. He was slight in build, delicate in health,



and ascetic in habits, his one interest in the world being the



upbuilding of the kingdom of God--as he understood it. It was the



time when Pusey, Newman, Keble, and their compeers were reviving



mediaeval Christianity; their ideas took strong hold upon many



earnest men in the western world, and among these no one absorbed



them more fully than this young missionary. He was honest,



fearless, self-sacrificing, and these qualities soon gave him a



strong hold upon his flock,--the hold of a mediaeval saint upon



pilgrims seeking refuge from a world cruel and perverse.







Seeing this, sundry clergymen and influential laymen of what were



known as the "evangelical denominations" attempted to refute his



arguments and discredit his practices. That was the very thing



which he and his congregation most needed: under this opposition



his fervor deepened, his mediaeval characteristics developed, his



little band of the faithful increased, and more and more they



adored him; but this adoration did not in the least injure him:



he remained the same gentle, fearless, narrow, uncompromising man



throughout his long life







My first recollections of religious worship in the little old



church take me back to my fourth year; and I can remember well,



at the age of five, standing between my father and mother,



reading the Psalter with them as best I could, joining in the



chants and looking with great awe on the service as it went on



before my admiring eyes. So much did it impress me that from my



sixth to my twelfth year I always looked forward to Sunday



morning with longing. The prayers, the chants, the hymns, all had



a great attraction for me,--and this although I was somewhat



severely held to the proper observance of worship. I remember



well that at the age of six years, if I faltered in the public



reading of the Psalter, a gentle rap on the side of my head from



my father's knuckles reminded me of my duty.







At various times since I have been present at the most gorgeous



services of the Anglican, Latin, Russian, and Oriental churches;



have heard the Pope, surrounded by his cardinals, sing mass at



the high altar of St. Peter's; have seen the Metropolitan



Archbishop of Moscow, surrounded by prelates of the Russian



Empire, conduct the burial of a czar; have seen the highest



Lutheran dignitaries solemnize the marriage of a German kaiser;



have sat under the ministrations of sundry archbishops of



Canterbury; have been present at high mass performed by the



Archbishop of Athens under the shadow of Mars Hill and the



Parthenon; and, though I am singularly susceptible to the



influence of such pageants, especially if they are accompanied by



noble music, no one of these has ever made so great an impression



upon me as that simple Anglo-American service performed by a



surpliced clergyman with a country choir and devout assemblage in



this little village church. Curiously enough, one custom, which



high-churchmen long ago discarded as beneath the proper dignity



of the service, was perhaps the thing which impressed me most,



and I have since learned that it generally thus impressed



new-comers to the Episcopal Church: this was the retirement of



the clergyman, at the close of the regular morning prayer, to the



vestry, where he left his surplice, and whence he emerged in a



black Geneva gown, in which he then preached the sermon. This



simple feature in the ceremonial greatly impressed me, and led me



to ask the reason for it: at which answer was made that the



clergyman wore his white surplice as long as he was using God's



words, but that he wore his black gown whenever he used his own.







Though comparatively little was said by Episcopalians regarding



religious experiences or pious states of mind, there was an



atmosphere of orderly decency during the whole service which



could hardly fail to make an impression on all thinking children



brought into it. I remember that when, on one or two occasions, I



was taken to the Congregational church by my grandmother, I was



much shocked at what seemed to me the unfit dress and conduct of



the clergyman,--in a cutaway coat, lounging upon a sofa,--and at



the irreverent ways of the sturdy farmers, who made ready to



leave the church during the final prayer, and even while they



should have been receiving the benediction.







I thus became a devotee. Of the sermons I retained little, except



a few striking assertions or large words; one of my amusements,



on returning home, was conducting a sort of service, on my own



account, with those of the household who were willing to take



part in it; and, from some traditions preserved in the family



regarding my utterances on such occasions, a droll sort of



service it must have been.







In my seventh year the family removed to Syracuse, the "Central



City" of the State, already beginning a wonderful career,



although at that time of less than six thousand inhabitants. My



experience in the new city was prefaced by an excursion, with my



father and mother and younger brother, to Buffalo and Niagara;



and as the railways through central New York were then



unfinished,--and, indeed, but few of them begun,--we made the



journey almost entirely on a canal-packet. Perhaps my most vivid



remembrance of this voyage is that of the fervid prayers I then



put up against shipwreck.







At Syracuse was a much larger and more influential Protestant



Episcopal church than that which we had left,--next, indeed, in



importance to the Presbyterian body. That church--St. Paul's--has



since become the mother of a large number of others, and has been



made the cathedral of a new diocese. In this my father, by virtue



of his vigor in everything he undertook, was soon made a



vestryman, and finally senior warden; and, the rectorate



happening to fall vacant, he recommended for the place our former



clergyman, Henry Gregory. He came, and his work in the new place



was soon even more effective than in the old.







His first influence made me a most determined little bigot, and I



remember well my battles in behalf of high-church ideas with



various Presbyterian boys, and especially with the son of the



Presbyterian pastor. In those days went on a famous controversy



provoked by a speech at a New England dinner in the city of New



York which had set by the ears two eminent divines--the Rev. Dr.



Wainwright, Episcopalian, and the Rev. Dr. Potts; Presbyterian.



Dr. Potts had insisted that the Puritans had founded a "church



without a bishop and a state without a king"; Dr. Wainwright



insisted that there could be no church without a bishop; and on



this the two champions joined issue. Armed with the weapons



furnished me in the church catechism, in sundry sermons, and in



pious reading, I took up the cudgels, and the battles then waged



were many and severe.







One little outgrowth of my religious intolerance was quickly



nipped in the bud. As I was returning home one evening with a



group of scampish boys, one of them pointed out the "Jew



store,"--in those days a new thing,--and reminded us that the



proprietor worshiped on Saturday and, doubtless, committed other



abominations. At this, with one accord, we did what we could to



mete out the Old Testament punishment for blasphemy--we threw



stones at his door. My father, hearing of this, dealt with me



sharply and shortly, and taught me most effectually to leave



dealing with the Jewish religion to the Almighty. I have never



since been tempted to join in any anti-Semitic movement whatever.







Meanwhile Mr. Gregory--or, as he afterward became, Dr.



Gregory--was fighting the battles of the church in many ways, and



some of his sermons made a great impression upon me. Of these one



was entitled "The Church not a Sect," the text being, "For as to



this sect, we know that it is everywhere spoken against." Another



sermon showed, especially, his uncompromising spirit and took yet



stronger hold upon me; it was given on an occasion when



Presbyterians, Methodists, and Baptists were drawn in large



numbers to his church; but, disdaining all efforts to propitiate



them, he took as his subject "The Sin of Korah," who set himself



up against the regularly ordained priesthood, and was, with all



his adherents, fearfully punished. The conclusion was easily



drawn by all the "dissenters" present. On another occasion of the



same sort, when his church was filled with people from other



congregations, he took as his subject the story of Naaman the



Syrian, his text being, "Are not Abana and Pharphar, rivers of



Damascus, better than all the rivers of Israel? May I not wash in



them and be clean?" The good rector's answer was, in effect, "No,



you may not. The Almighty designated the river Jordan as the



means for securing health and safety; and so in these times he



has designated for a similar purpose the church--which is the



Protestant Episcopal Church: outside of that--as the one



appointed by him--you have no hope."







But gradually there came in my mind a reaction, and curiously, it



started from my love for my grandmother--my mother's mother.



Among all the women whom I remember in my early life, she was the



kindest and most lovely. She had been brought as a young girl, by



her parents, from Old Guilford in Connecticut; and in her later



life she often told me cheerily of the days of privation and



toil, of wolves howling about the cottages of the little New York



settlement in winter, of journeys twenty miles to church, of



riding on horseback from early morning until late in the evening,



through the forests, to bring flour from the mill. She was



quietly religious, reading every day from her New Testament, but



remaining in the old Congregational Church which my mother had



left. I remember once asking her why she did not go with the rest



of us to the Episcopal Church. Her answer was, "Well, dear child,



the Episcopal Church is just the church for your father and



mother and for you children; you are all young and active, but I



am getting old and rather stout, and there is a little too much



getting up and sitting down in your church for me." To the harsh



Calvinism of her creed she seemed to pay no attention, and, if



hard pressed by me, used to say, "Well, sonny, there is, of



course, some merciful way out of it all." Her religion took every



kindly form. She loved every person worth loving,--and some not



worth loving,--and her benefactions were extended to people of



every creed; especially was she a sort of Providence to the poor



Catholic Irish of the lower part of the town. To us children she



was especially devoted--reconciling us in our quarrels, soothing



us in our sorrows, comforting us in our disappointments, and



carrying us through our sicknesses. She used great common sense



in her care of us; kindly and gentle to the last degree, there



was one thing she would never allow, and this was that the



children, even when they became quite large, should be out of the



house, in the streets or public places, after dark, without an



elderly and trusty companion. Though my brother and I used to



regard this as her one fault, it was really a great service to



us; for, as soon as dusk came on, if we were tempted to linger in



the streets or in public places, we returned home, since we knew



that if we did not we should soon see her coming to remind us,



and this was, of course, a serious blow to our pride.







When, then, I sat in church and heard our mediaeval saint preach



with ardor and unction, Sunday after Sunday, that the promises



were made to the church alone; that those outside it had



virtually no part in God's goodness; that they were probably



lost,--I thought of this dear, sweet old lady, and my heart rose



in rebellion. She was certainly the best Christian I knew, and



the idea that she should be punished for saying her prayers in



the Presbyterian Church was abhorrent to me. I made up my mind



that, if she was to be lost, I would be lost with her; and soon,



under the influence of thoughts like these, I became a religious



rebel.







The matter was little helped when our good rector preached upon



retribution for sin. He held the most extreme views regarding



future punishment; and the more he developed them, the more my



mind rejected the idea that so many good people about me,



especially the one whom I loved so much, could be subjected to



such tortures,--and the more my heart rebelled against the Moloch



who had established and was administering so horrible a system. I



must have been about twelve years old when it thus occurred to me



to question the whole sacred theory; and this questioning was



started into vigorous life after visiting, with some other



school-boys, the Presbyterian church when a "revival" was going



on. As I entered, a very unspiritual-looking preacher was laying



down the most severe doctrines of divine retribution. In front of



him were several of our neighbors' daughters, many of them my



schoolmates, whom I regarded as thoroughly sweet and good; and



they were in tears, apparently broken-hearted under the storm of



wrath which poured over them from the mouth of the revival



preacher. At this I revolted entirely, and from that moment I



disbelieved in the whole doctrine, utterly and totally. I felt



that these kindly girls, to whom I had looked with so much



admiration in the classes at school and in our various little



gatherings, were infinitely more worthy of the divine favor than



was the big, fleshly creature storming and raging and claiming to



announce a divine message.







Some influence on my youthful thinking had also been exercised by



sundry occurrences in our own parish. Our good rector was



especially fond of preaching upon "baptismal regeneration";



taking the extreme high-church view and thereby driving out some



of the best "evangelicals" from his congregation. One of these I



remember especially--a serene, dignified old man, Mr. John



Durnford. After he left our church he took his place among the



Presbyterians, and I remember, despite my broad-church



tendencies, thinking that he was incurring serious danger by such



apostasy; but as I noted him, year after year, devoting himself



to the newly founded orphan-asylum, giving all his spare time to



the care of the children gathered there, even going into the



market and thence bearing provisions to them in a basket, I began



to feel that perhaps his soul was safe, after all. I bethought



myself that, with all my reading of the Bible, I had never found



any text which required a man to believe in the doctrines of the



Protestant Episcopal Church; but that I had found, in the words



of Jesus himself, as well as in the text of St James regarding



"pure religion and undefiled," declarations which seemed to



commend, especially, labors for the poor, fatherless, and



afflicted, like those of Mr. Durnford.







But still more marked was the influence on my thinking of a



painful clash in the parish. It came on this wise. Our rector was



one day called to attend the funeral of a little child but a few



weeks old, the daughter of neighbors of ours. The father was a



big-bodied, big-hearted, big-voiced, successful man of business,



well liked for his bluff cordiality and generosity, who went to



church because his wife went. The mother was a sweet, kindly,



delicate woman, the daughter of a clergyman, and devoted to the



church.







It happened that, for various reasons, and more especially on



account of the absence of the father from home on business, the



baptism of the child had been delayed until its sudden death



prevented the rite forever.







The family and neighbors being assembled at the house, and the



service about to begin, an old maiden lady, who had deeply



absorbed the teachings of Dr. Gregory and wished to impress them



on those present, said to the father, audibly and with a groan,



"Oh, Mr.----, what a pity that the baby was not baptized!" to



which the rector responded, with a deep sigh and in a most



plaintive voice, "Yes!" Thereupon the mother of the child burst



into loud and passionate weeping, and at this the father, big and



impulsive as he was, lost all control of himself. Rising from his



chair, he strode to the side of the rector and said, "That is a



slander on the Almighty; none but a devil could, for my



negligence, punish this lovely little child by ages of torture.



Take it back--take it back, sir; or, by the God that made us, I



will take you by the neck and throw you into the street!" At this



the gentle rector faltered out that he did not presume to limit



the mercy of God, and after a time the service went on; but



sermons on baptismal regeneration from our pulpit were never



afterward frequent or cogent.







Startled as I was at this scene, I felt that the doctrine had not



stood the test. More and more there was developed in me that



feeling which Lord Bacon expressed so profoundly and pithily, in



his essay on "Superstition," when he said:







It were better to have no opinion of God at all, than such an



opinion as is unworthy of Him; for if the one is unbelief, the



other is contumely: and certainly superstition is the reproach of



the Deity. Plutarch saith well to that purpose: "Surely, I had



rather a great deal that men should say there was no such man at



all as Plutarch, than that they should say that Plutarch ate his



children as soon as they were born;"--as the poets speak of



Saturn: and as the contumely is greater towards God, so the



danger is greater towards men.











The "danger" of which Bacon speaks has been noted by me often,



both before and since I read his essays. Once, indeed, when a



very orthodox lady had declared to me her conviction that every



disbeliever in the divinity of the second person in the Trinity



must be lost, I warned her of this danger and said, "We lately



had President Grant here on the university grounds. Suppose your



little girl, having met the President, and having been told that



he was the great general of the war and President of the United



States, should assert her disbelief, basing it on the fact that



she had formed the idea of a much more showy and gorgeous person



than this quiet, modest little man; and suppose that General



Grant, on hearing of the child's mistake, should cruelly punish



her for it; what would you think of him? and what would he think



of you, were he to know that you asserted that he could be so



contemptibly unjust and cruel? The child's utterance would not in



the slightest offend him, but your imputation to him of such



vileness would most certainly anger him."







A contribution to my religious development came also from a very



different quarter. Our kitchen Bridget, one of the best of her



kind, lent me her book of devotion--the "Ursuline Manual." It



interested me much until I found in it the reasons very cogently



given why salvation was confined to the Roman Catholic Church.



This disgusted me. According to this, even our good rector had no



more chance of salvation than a Presbyterian or Baptist or



Methodist minister. But this serious view of the case was



disturbed by a humorous analogy. There were then fighting



vigorously through the advertisement columns of the newspapers



two rival doctors, each claiming to produce the only salutary



"sarsaparilla," and each named Townsend. At first one claimed to



be "THE Dr. Townsend," then the other claimed to be "THE Dr.



Townsend"; the first rejoined that HE was "Dr. JACOB Townsend,"



whereupon the other insisted that HE was "Dr. Jacob Townsend"; to



this the first answered that HE was "the ORIGINAL Dr. Jacob



Townsend," and the other then declared that HE was "the ORIGINAL



Dr. Jacob Townsend"; and so on, through issue after issue, each



supplying statements, certificates, arguments, rejoinders ad



nauseam. More and more, then, the various divines insisting on



the exclusive possession of the only remedy for sin reminded me



of these eminent sarsaparilla-makers,--each declaring his own



concoction genuine and all others spurious, each glorifying



himself as possessing the original recipe and denouncing his



rivals as pretenders.







Another contribution to my thought was made one day in the



Sunday-school. While reading in the New Testament I had noticed



the difficulties involved in the two genealogies of Jesus of



Nazareth--that in Matthew and that in Luke. On my asking the



Sunday-school teacher for an explanation, he gave the offhand



answer that one was the genealogy of Joseph and the other of



Mary. Of course it did not take me long to find this answer



inadequate; and, as a consequence, Sunday-school teaching lost



much of its effect upon me.







But there was still one powerful influence left in behalf of the



old creed. From time to time came the visitation by the bishop,



Dr. DeLancey. He was the most IMPRESSIVE man I have ever seen. I



have stood in the presence of many prelates in my day, from Pope



Pius IX down; but no one of them has ever so awed me as this



Bishop of Western New York. His entry into a church chancel was



an event; no music could be finer than his reading of the



service; his confirmation prayer still dwells in my memory as the



most perfect petition I have ever heard; and his simple, earnest



sermons took strong hold of me. His personal influence was also



great. Goldsmith's lines in the "Deserted Village,"







     "Even children follow'd with endearing wile



      And pluck'd his gown, to share the good man's smile,"







accurately pictured the feelings of many of us as we lingered



after service to see him greet our fathers and mothers.







As to my biblical studies, they were continued, though not



perhaps as systematically as they might well have been. The



Protestant Episcopal Church has for a youth at least one



advantage in this respect,--that the services including Introits,



Canticles, Psalter, Lessons, Epistles Gospels, and various



quotations, familiarize him with the noblest utterances in our



sacred books. My mother had received instruction in Bible class



and prized Scripture reading; therefore it was that, when I was



allowed to stay at home from church on Sunday afternoons, it was



always on condition that I should read a certain number of



chapters in the Bible and prove to her upon her return that I had



read them carefully,--and this was not without its uses.







Here I am reminded of a somewhat curious event. One afternoon,



when I had been permitted to remain at home, on the usual



conditions, my mother, returning from service, said to me that by



staying away from church I had missed something very interesting:



that there was a good sermon well given, that the preacher was of



fine appearance, dignified,--and an Indian; but that she would



never have suspected him to be an Indian were it not for his



words at the conclusion of his sermon, which were as follows:



"And now, my brethren, I leave you. We shall probably never meet



again in this world, and doubtless most of you will forget all



the counsels I have given you and remember nothing save that you



have to-day heard a sermon from an Indian." The point of interest



really was that this preacher, Eleazar Williams, though he gave



no hint of it on this occasion, believed himself, and was



believed by many, to be the lost Dauphin of France, Louis XVII,



and that decidedly skilful arguments in favor of his claims were



published by the Rev. Mr. Hanson and others. One of the most



intelligent women I have ever known believes to this hour that



Eleazar Williams, generally known as a half-breed Indian born in



Canada, was the son of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, and that



his portly form and Bourbon face were convincing additions to



other more cogent testimonies.







At various times I sought light from new sources, and, finding on



the family shelves a series of books called the "Evangelical



Family Library," I read sundry replies to Hume, Gibbon, and other



deists; but the arguments of Hume and Gibbon and those who



thought with them seemed to me, to say the least, quite as



forcible as those in answer to them. These replies simply



strengthened my tendency to doubt, and what I heard at church



rather increased the difficulty; for the favorite subjects of



sermons in the Episcopal Church of those days, after the



"Apostolical Succession" and "Baptismal Regeneration," were the



perfections of the church order, the beauty of its services, and



the almost divine character of the Prayer-book. These topics were



developed in all the moods and tenses; the beauties of our own



service were constantly contrasted with the crudities and



absurdities of the worship practised by others; and although,



since those days, left to my own observation, I have found much



truth in these comparisons, they produced upon me at that time



anything but a good effect. It was like a beautiful woman coming



into an assemblage; calling attention to the perfections of her



own face, form, and garments; claiming loudly to be the most



beautiful person in the room; and so, finally, becoming the least



attractive person present.







This state of mind was deepened by my first experiences at



college. I had, from my early boyhood, wished to go to Yale; but,



under pressure from the bishop, I was sent to the little church



college at Geneva in western New York There were excellent men



among its professors--men whom I came to love and admire; but its



faculty, its endowment, its equipment, were insufficient, and for



fear of driving away the sons of its wealthy and influential



patrons it could not afford to insist either on high scholarship



or good discipline, so that the work done was most



unsatisfactory. And here I may mention that the especial claim



put forth by this college, as by so many others like it



throughout the country, was that, with so small a body of



students directly under church control, both the intellectual and



religious interests of the students would be better guarded than



they could be in the larger and comparatively unsectarian



institutions. The very contrary was then true; and various



experiences have shown me that, as a rule, little sectarian



colleges, if too feeble to exercise strong discipline or insist



on thorough work, are the more dangerous. As it was, I felt that



in this particular case a wrong had been done me and charged that



wrong against the church system.







I have been glad to learn of late years that the college just



referred to has, since my student days, shared the upward



progress of its sister institutions and that with more means and



better appliances a succession of superior instructors have been



able to bring its students into steady good work and under



excellent discipline.







Much was made in those days of the "Christian evidences," and one



statement then put forth, regarding the miraculous, produced a



temporary effect upon me. This statement was that the claims of



the religions opposed to Christianity did not rest upon miracles;



that there was, at any rate, no real testimony to any except



Christian miracles; and that, as a rule, other religions did not



pretend to exhibit any. But when I, shortly afterward, read the



life of Mohammed, and saw what a great part was played by his



miracle at the battle of Beder, during which, on his throwing



dust into the air, there came to his rescue legions of angels,



who were seen and testified to by many on the field,--both by his



friends and by his enemies; and when I found that miraculous



testimonies play a leading part in all religions, even in favor



of doctrines the most cruel and absurd, I felt that the



"evidences" must be weak which brought forward an argument so ill



grounded. Moreover, in my varied reading I came across multitudes



of miracles attributed to saints of the Roman Catholic



Church,--miracles for which myriads of good men and women were



ready to lay down their lives in attestation of their



belief,--and if we must accept one class of miracles, I could not



see why we should not accept the other.







At the close of this first year, for reasons given elsewhere, I



broke away from this little college and went to Yale.















CHAPTER LIX







IN THE NEW ENGLAND ATMOSPHERE--1851-1853







At Yale I found myself in the midst of New England



Congregationalism; but I cannot say that it helped me much



religiously. It, indeed, broadened my view, since I was



associated with professors and students of various forms of



Christianity, and came to respect them, not for what they



professed, but for what they really were.







There also I read under an excellent professor--my dear friend



the late President Porter--Butler's "Analogy"; but, though it



impressed me, it left on my mind the effect of a strong piece of



special pleading,--of a series of arguments equally valuable for



any religion which had once "got itself established."







Here, too, a repellent influence was exercised upon me by a



"revival." What was called a "religious interest" began to be



shown in sundry student meetings, and soon it came in with a full



tide. I was induced to go into one or two of these assemblies,



and was somewhat impressed by the penitence shown and the pledges



given by some of my college friends. But within a year the whole



thing was dead. Several of the men who had been loudest in their



expressions of penitence and determination to accept Christianity



became worse than ever: they were like logs stranded high and dry



after a freshet.







But this religious revival in college was infinitely better than



one which ran its course in the immediate neighborhood. Just at



the corner of the college grounds was a Methodist Episcopal



church, the principal one in New Haven, and, a professional



revivalist having begun his work there, the church was soon



thronged. Blasphemy and ribaldry were the preacher's great



attractions. One of the prayers attributed to him ran as follows:



"Come down among us, O Lord! Come straight through the roof; I'll



pay for the shingles!" Night after night the galleries were



crowded with students laughing at this impious farce; and among



them, one evening, came "Charley" Chotard of Mississippi. Chotard



was a very handsome fellow: slender, well formed, six feet three



inches tall, and in any crowd a man of mark, like King Saul. In



the midst of the proceedings, at some grotesque utterance of the



revivalist, the students in the galleries burst into laughter.



The preacher, angrily turning his eyes upon the offenders, saw,



first of all, Chotard, and called out to him: "You lightning-rod



of hell, you flag-staff of damnation, come down from there!" Of



course no such grotesque scenes were ever allowed in the college



chapel: the services there, though simple, were always dignified;



yet even in these there sometimes appeared incongruous features.







According to tradition in my time, an aged divine, greatly and



justly beloved, from a neighboring city, had been asked to preach



before the students. It was at the time when the whole



English-speaking world had been thrilled by the story of the



relief of Lucknow, and the cry of the Scotch lassie who heard the



defiant slogan and heart-stirring pibroch of the Highlanders



coming to the relief of the besieged had echoed across all the



oceans. Toward the close of his sermon the dear old doctor became



very impressive. He recited the story of Lucknow, and then spoke



in substance as follows: "So to-day, my young friends, I sound in



your ears the slo-o-o-broch of salvation." The alliteration



evidently pleased him, and he repeated it with more and more



emphasis in his peroration. When he sat down another clergyman



who was with him at the sacred desk reminded him of his mistake,



whereupon the good old doctor rose and addressed the students as



follows: "My young friends, you doubtless noticed a mistake in my



final remarks. I said 'slo-o-o-o-broch'; of course I meant



'pi-i-g-a-a-an.' "







Then, too, it must be confessed that some of the weekday prayers



made by lay professors lent themselves rather too easily to



parody. One of my classmates--since known as a grave and



respected judge--was especially gifted in imitating these



petitions, with the very intonations of their authors, and these



parodies were in great demand on festive occasions. The pet



phrases, the choice rhetoric, and the impressive oratory of these



prayers were thus made so familiar to us in caricatures that the



originals were little conducive to devotion.







The influence at Yale of men like Goodrich, Taylor, Woolsey, and



Porter, whom I saw in their professors' chairs, was indeed strong



upon me. I respected and admired them; but their purely religious



teaching took but little hold on me; I can remember clearly but



two or three sermons which I heard preached in Yale chapel. One



was at the setting up of the chapel organ, when Horace Bushnell



of Hartford preached upon music; and another was when President



Woolsey preached a baccalaureate sermon upon "Righteous Anger."



The first of these sermons was very beautiful, but the second was



powerful. It has had an influence--and, I think, a good



influence--on my thoughts from that day to this; and it ought to



be preached in every pulpit in our country, at least once a year,



as an antidote to our sickly, mawkish lenity to crime and wrong.







In those days conformity to religious ideas was carried very far



at Yale. On week-days we had early prayers at about six in the



morning, and evening prayers at about the same hour in the



afternoon; but on Sundays we had not only morning and evening



prayers in the chapel, but morning and afternoon service at



church. I attended St. Paul's Episcopal church, sitting in one of



the gallery pews assigned to undergraduates; but cannot say that



anything that I heard during this period of my life elevated me



especially. I joined in the reading of the Psalter, in the



singing of the chants and hymns, and, occasionally, in reciting



part of the creeds, though more and more this last exercise



became peculiarly distasteful to me.







Time has but confirmed the opinion, which I then began to hold,



that, of all mistaken usages in a church service, the most



unfortunate is this demand which confronts a man who would gladly



unite with Christians in Christian work, and, in a spirit of



loyalty to the Blessed Founder of Christianity, would cheerfully



become a member of the church and receive the benefit of its



ministrations;--the demand that such a man stand and deliver a



creed made no one knows where or by whom, and of which no human



being can adjust the meanings to modern knowledge, or indeed to



human comprehension.







My sympathies, tastes, and aims led me to desire to enter fully



into the church in which I was born; there was no other part of



the service in which I could not do my part; but to stand up and



recite the creeds in all their clauses, honestly, I could not. I



had come to know on what slender foundations rested, for example,



the descent into hell; and, as to the virgin birth, my reading



showed me so weak a basis for it in the New Testament taken as a



whole, and so many similar claims made in behalf of divine



founders of religions, that when I reflected upon the reasons for



holding the doctrine to be an aftergrowth upon the original



legend, it was impossible for me to go on loudly proclaiming my



belief in it. Sometimes I have refrained from reciting any part



of the creed; but often, in my reverence for what I admire in the



service, in my love for those whom I have heard so devoutly take



part in it in days gone by, and in my sympathy with those about



me, I have been wont to do what I could,--have joined in



repeating parts of it, leaving out other parts which I, at least,



ought not to repeat.







Various things combined to increase my distrust for the



prevailing orthodoxy. I had a passion for historical



reading,--indeed, at that time had probably read more and thought



more upon my reading than had most men of my age in college,--and



the more I thus read and thought, the more evident it became to



me that, while the simple religion of the Blessed Founder of



Christianity has gone on through the ages producing the noblest



growths of faith, hope, and charity, many of the beliefs insisted



upon within the church as necessary to salvation were survivals



of primeval superstition, or evolved in obedience to pagan



environment or Jewish habits of thought or Greek metaphysics or



mediaeval interpolations in our sacred books; that most of the



frightful systems and events in modern history have arisen from



theological dogmatism; that the long reign of hideous cruelty in



the administration of the penal law, with its torture-chambers,



its burnings of heretics and witches, its cruelties of every



sort, its repression of so much of sane human instinct and noble



human thought, arose from this source, directly or indirectly;



and that even such ghastly scenes as those of the French



Revolution were provoked by a natural reaction in the minds of a



people whom the church, by its theory of divine retribution, had



educated for ages to be cruel.







But what impressed me most directly as regards the whole orthodox



part of the church was its virtual support of slavery in the



crisis then rapidly approaching. Excellent divines, like Bishop



Hopkins of Vermont, the Rev. Dr Parker of New Jersey, and others



holding high positions in various sects throughout the country,



having based elaborate defenses of slavery upon Scripture, the



church as a whole had acquiesced in this view. I had become



bitterly opposed, first to the encroachments of the slave power



in the new Territories of the United States, and finally to



slavery itself; and this alliance between it and orthodoxy



deepened my distrust of what was known about me as religion. As



the struggle between slavery and freedom deepened, this feeling



of mine increased. During my first year at college the



fugitive-slave law was passed, and this seemed to me the acme of



abominations. There were, it is true, a few religious men who



took high ground against slavery; but these were generally New



England Unitarians or members of other bodies rejected by the



orthodox, and this fact increased my distrust of the dominant



religion.







Some years before this, while yet a boy preparing for college, I



had met for the first time a clergyman of this sort--the Rev.



Samuel Joseph May, pastor of the Unitarian church in Syracuse;



and he had attracted me from the first moment that I saw him.



There was about him something very genial and kindly, which won a



way to all hearts. Though I knew him during many years, he never



made the slightest effort to proselyte me. To every good work in



the community, and especially to all who were down-trodden or



oppressed, he was steadfastly devoted; the Onondaga Indians of



central New York found in him a stanch ally against the



encroachments of their scheming white neighbors; fugitive slaves



knew him as their best friend, ready to risk his own safety in



their behalf.







Although he was the son of an honored Massachusetts family, a



graduate of Harvard, a disciple of Channing, a man of sincere



character and elegant manners, he was evidently dreaded by the



great majority of the orthodox Christians about him. I remember



speaking to him once of a clergyman who had recently arrived in



Syracuse, and who was an excellent scholar. Said Mr. May to me,



"I should like to know him, if that were possible." I asked, "Why



not call upon him?" He answered, "I would gladly do so, but do



you suppose he would return my call?" "Of course he would," I



replied; "he is a gentleman." "Yes," said Mr. May, "no doubt he



is, and so are the other clergymen; yet I have called on them as



they have come, and only two or three of them all have ever



entered my house since." Orthodox fanatics came to remonstrate



and pray with him, but these he generally overcame with his sweet



and kindly manner. To slavery he was an uncompromising foe, being



closely associated with Garrison, Phillips, and the leaders of



the antislavery movement; and so I came to see that there was a



side to Christianity not necessarily friendly to slavery: but I



also saw that it was a side not welcomed by the churches in



general, and especially distrusted in my own family. I remember



taking to him once an old friend of mine, a man of most severe



orthodoxy; and after we had left Mr. May's house I asked my



friend what he thought of the kindly heretic. He answered, "Those



of us who shall be so fortunate as to reach heaven are to be



greatly surprised at some of the people we are to meet there."







As a Yale student I found an additional advantage in the fact



that I could now frequently hear distinguished clergymen who were



more or less outside the orthodox pale. Of these were the liberal



Congregationalists of New York, Brooklyn, and Boston, and, above



all, Henry Ward Beecher, Edwin Chapin, and Theodore Parker. At



various times during my college course I visited Boston, and was



taken by my classmate and old friend George Washburn Smalley to



hear Parker. He drew immense crowds of thoughtful people. The



music-hall, where he spoke, contained about four thousand seats,



and at each visit of mine every seat, so far as I could see, was



filled. Both Parker's prayers and sermons were inspiring. He was



a deeply religious man; probably the most thorough American



scholar, orthodox or unorthodox, of his time; devoted to the



public good and an intense hater of slavery. His influence over



my thinking was, I believe, excellent; his books, and those of



Channing which I read at this time, did me great good by checking



all inclination to cynicism and scoffing; more than any other



person he strengthened my theistic ideas and stopped any tendency



to atheism; the intense conviction with which men like Channing,



Parker, and May spoke of a God in the universe gave a direction



to my thinking which has never been lost.







As to Beecher, nothing could exceed his bold brilliancy. He was a



man of genius; even more a poet than an orator; in sympathy with



every noble cause; and utterly without fear of the pew-holders



inside his church or of the mob outside. Heresy-hunters did not



daunt him. Humor played over much of his sermonizing; wit



coruscated through it; but there was at times a pathos which



pervaded the deep places of the human heart. By virtue of his



poetic insight he sounded depths of thought and feeling which no



mere theological reasoning could ever reach. He was a



man,--indeed, a great man,--but to the end of his life he



retained the freshness of youth. General Grant, who greatly



admired him, once said to me, "Beecher is a boy--a glorious boy."







Beecher's love of nature was a passion. During one of his visits



to Cornell University, I was driving through the woods with him,



and he was in the full tide of brilliant discourse when,



suddenly, he grasped my hand which held the reins and said



peremptorily, "Stop!" I obeyed, and all was still save the note



of a bird in the neighboring thicket. Our stop and silence lasted



perhaps five minutes, when he said, "Did you hear that bird? That



is the----(giving a name I have forgotten). You are lucky to have



him here; I would give a hundred dollars to have him nest as near



me."







During this visit of his to my house, I remember finding, one



morning, that he had been out of doors since daylight; and on my



expressing surprise at his rising so early after sitting up so



late, he said, "I wanted to enjoy the squirrels in your trees."







Wonderful, too, was his facility, not merely in preaching, but in



thinking. When, on another visit, he stayed with me, he took no



thought regarding his sermon at the university chapel, so far as



one could see. Every waking moment was filled with things which



apparently made preparation for preaching impossible. I became



somewhat nervous over this neglect; for, so far as I could learn,



he had nothing written, he never spoke from memory, and not only



the students, but the people from the whole country round about,



were crowding toward the chapel.







Up to the last moment before leaving my house for the morning



service, he discussed the best shrubs for planting throughout our



groves and woods, and the best grasses to use in getting a good



turf upon the university grounds. But, on leaving the house, he



became silent and walked slowly, his eyes fixed steadily on the



ground; and as I took it for granted that he was collecting his



thoughts for his sermon, I was careful not to disturb him. As we



reached the chapel porch, a vast crowd in waiting and the organ



pealing, he suddenly stopped, turned round, lifted his eyes from



the ground, and said, "I have been studying your lawn all the way



down here; what you need is to sow Kentucky blue-grass." Then he



entered the chapel, and shortly was in the midst of a sermon



evidently suggested by the occasion, his whole manuscript being a



few pencilings on a sheet or two of note-paper, all the rest



being extemporized in his best vein, both as to matter and



manner.







Chapin, too, was brilliant and gifted, but very different in



every respect from Beecher. His way was to read from manuscript,



and then, from time to time, to rise out of it and soar above it,



speaking always forcibly and often eloquently. His gift of



presenting figures of speech so that they became vivid realities



to his audience was beyond that of any other preacher I ever



heard. Giving once a temperance address, and answering the



argument as to the loss of property involved in the confiscation



of intoxicants, he suddenly pictured a balance let down from the



hand of the Almighty, in one scale all the lucre lost, in the



other all the crimes, the wrecks, the miseries, the sorrows, the



griefs, the widows' groans and orphans' tears,--until we



absolutely seemed to have the whole vast, terrific mass swaying



in mid-air before us.







On another occasion, preaching from the text, "Now we see through



a glass darkly, but then face to face," he presented the picture



of a man in his last illness, seeing dimly, through a



half-transparent medium, the faint, dim outline of the Divinity



whom he was so rapidly nearing; and then, suddenly, death,--the



shattering of the glass,--and the man, on the instant, standing



before his Maker and seeing him "face to face." It all seems poor



when put upon paper; but, as he gave it, nothing could be more



vivid. We seemed to hear the sudden crash of the translucent



sheet, and to look full into the face of the Almighty looming up



before us.







Chapin was a Universalist, and his most interesting parishioner



was Horace Greeley, whose humanitarian ideas naturally inclined



him to a very mild creed. As young men, strangers to the



congregation, were usually shown to seats just in front of the



pulpit, I could easily see Mr. Greeley in his pew on a side



aisle, just behind the front row. He generally stalked in rather



early, the pockets of his long white coat filled with newspapers,



and, immediately on taking his seat, went to sleep. As soon as



service began he awoke, looked first to see how many vacant



places were in the pew, and then, without a word, put out his



long arm into the aisle and with one or two vigorous scoops



pulled in a sufficient number of strangers standing there to fill



all the vacancies; then--he slept again. Indeed, he slept through



most of the written parts of Dr. Chapin's sermons; but whenever



there came anything eloquent or especially thoughtful, Greeley's



eyes were wide open and fixed upon the preacher.







Greeley's humanitarianism was not always proof against the



irritations of life. In his not infrequent outbursts of wrath he



was very likely to consign people who vexed him to a region



which, according to his creed, had no existence.







A story told of him in those days seemed to show that his creed



did not entirely satisfy him; for one day, when he was trying, in



spite of numberless interruptions, to write a "Tribune" leader,



he became aware that some one was standing behind his chair.



Turning around suddenly, he saw a missionary well known in the



city slums,--the Rev. Mr. Pease,--and asked in his highest,



shrillest, most complaining falsetto, "Well, what do YOU want?"



Mr. Pease, a kindly, gentle, apologetic man, said deprecatingly,



"Well, Mr. Greeley, I have come for a little help. We are still



trying to save souls in the Five Points." "Oh," said Mr. Greeley,



"go along! go along! In my opinion, there ain't half so many men



damned as there ought to be."







But though Chapin's influence did not restrain Greeley at all



times, it undoubtedly did much for him, and it did much for us of



the younger generation; for it not only broadened our views, but



did something to better our hearts and raise our aims.







In this mention of the forces which acted upon my religious



feelings I ought to include one of a somewhat different sort.



There was one clergyman whose orthodoxy, though not of an extreme



type, was undoubted, and who exercised a good and powerful



influence upon me. This was the Rev. Dr. Leonard Bacon, pastor of



the First Congregational church in New Haven. He was a man of



great intellectual power, a lover of right and hater of wrong, a



born fighter on the side of every good cause, at times pungent,



witty, sarcastic, but always deeply in earnest. There was a



general feeling among his friends that, had he not gone into the



church, he would have been eminent in political life; and that is



my belief, for he was by far the most powerful debater of his



time in the councils of his church, and his way of looking at



great questions showed the characteristics of a really



broad-minded statesman. His sermons on special occasions, as at



Thanksgiving and on public anniversaries, were noted for their



directness and power in dealing with the greater moral questions



before the people. On the other hand, there was a saying then



current, "Dull as Dr. Bacon when he's nothing but the Gospel to



preach"; but this, like so many other smart sayings, was more



epigrammatic than true: even when I heard him preach religious



doctrines in which I did not at all believe, he seemed to me to



show his full power.







Toward the end of my college course I was subjected to the



influence of two very powerful men, outside of the university,



who presented entirely new trains of thought to me. The first of



these was Dr. Alonzo Potter, Bishop of Pennsylvania, who had been



the leading professor at Union College, Schenectady, before his



elevation to the bishopric, and who, both as professor and as



bishop, had exercised a very wide influence. He was physically,



intellectually, and morally of a very large pattern. There was



something very grand and impressive about him. He had happened to



come to Syracuse during one of my vacations; on a Saturday



evening he gave a lecture upon the tendencies to loose



supernaturalism as shown in what were known as "spiritualistic"



phenomena; and on the following day he preached a simple, plain,



straightforward sermon on Christian morals. Both these utterances



impressed me and strengthened my conviction that every thinking



young man and woman ought to maintain relations with some good



form of religious organization just as long as possible.







Toward the end of my Yale course came an influence of a very



different sort. It was at the consecration of a Roman Catholic



church at Saratoga. The mass was sung by an Italian prelate,



Bedini, who as governor and archbishop at Bologna had, a few



years before, made himself detested throughout the length and



breadth of Italy by the execution of the priest patriot Ugo



Bassi; and he was now, as papal nuncio to Brazil, environed by



all the pomp possible. The mass did not greatly impress me, but



the sermon, by Archbishop Hughes of New York, I shall always



remember. His subject was the doctrine of transubstantiation,



and, standing upon the altar steps, he developed an argument most



striking and persuasive. He spoke entirely without notes, in a



straightforward way, and at times with eloquence, though never



with any show of rhetoric: voice and bearing were perfect; and



how any one accepting his premises could avoid his conclusions I



could not see then and cannot see now. I was proof against his



argument, for the simple reason that I felt the story of the



temptation of Jesus by Satan, which he took for his text, to be



simply a legend such as appears in various religions; still, the



whole was wonderfully presented; and, on my return to the hotel,



my father was greatly encouraged as to my religious development



when I gave to him a synopsis of the whole sermon from end to



end.







Next day there resulted a curious episode. Notices were posted



throughout Saratoga that Father Gavazzi, the Italian patriot and



heretic, famous for his oratory, would hold a meeting in the



grove back of Congress Hall Hotel, at three in the afternoon, and



would answer the archbishop's argument. When the hour arrived an



immense crowd was assembled, and among them many Catholics, some



of whom I knew well,--one of them a young priest to whom I had



become strongly attached at school. Soon appeared the orator. He



was of most striking presence--tall, handsome, with piercing



black eyes and black hair, and clad in a long semi-monastic



cloak. His first line of argument was of little effect, though



given with impassioned gestures and a most sympathetic voice; but



soon he paused and spoke gently and simply as follows: "When I



was a priest in Italy I daily took part in the mass. On festivals



I often saw the fasting priest fill the chalice as full as he



dared with strong wine; I saw him pronounce the sacred words and



make the sacred sign over it; and I saw, as everybody standing



round him clearly saw, before the end of the service, that it



flushed his face, thickened his voice, and enlivened his manner.



My fellow-Christians" (and here his voice rang out like a



trumpet), "who is the infidel, who is the blasphemer,--I who say



that no change took place in the wine before the priest drank it,



and that no miracle was performed, or the man who says that his



fellow-man can be made drunk on the blood of the blessed Son of



God?"







The effect was startling, even on Protestants: but on the Roman



Catholics present it was most thrilling; and I remember that an



old Irishwoman, seated on the steps of the platform as these



words were uttered, clapped her hands to her ears and ran from



the place screaming. I must confess that my sympathies were with



her rather than with the iconoclast, despite his gifts and



graces.















CHAPTER LX







IN THE EUROPEAN ATMOSPHERE--1853-1856







Leaving Yale in 1853, I passed nearly three years in Europe; and



observation of the effects resulting from the various orthodoxies



in England, France, Germany, Russia, and Italy developed my



opinions in various ways. I was deeply susceptible to religious



architecture, music, and, indeed, to the nobler forms of



ceremonial. I doubt whether any man ever entered Westminster



Abbey and the various cathedrals of Great Britain--and I have



visited every one of them of any note--with a more reverent



feeling than that which animated me; but some features of the



Anglican service as practised at that time repelled me; above



all, I disliked the intoning of the prayers, as I then heard it



for the first time. A manly, straightforward petition made by a



man standing or kneeling before his Maker, in a natural, earnest



voice, has always greatly impressed me; but the sort of whining,



drawling, falsetto in which the Anglican prayers were then



usually intoned simply drove out all religious thoughts from my



mind. I had a feeling that the Almighty must turn with contempt



from a man who presumed thus to address him. Some prayers in the



church service had from a very early period taken a deep place in



my heart: the prayer of St. Chrysostom in the morning service,



the first prayer in the ante-communion service, the prayer "for



the whole state of Christ's church militant," and some of the



collects had become, as it were, part of me; so much the more



disappointed and disgusted was I, then, to hear prayer made in



what seemed to me a sickly, unmanly whine.







Although the feelings thus aroused by religious observances in



England and other parts of Europe were frequently unedifying,



there was one happy exception to the rule. Both in the Church of



England and in the Roman Catholic churches of the Continent I



always greatly enjoyed the antiphonal chanting of the Psalter. To



me this has always been--the imprecatory psalms excepted--by far



the noblest feature in Christian worship as worship; for, coming



down as it does from the Jewish Church through the whole history



of the Christian Church, and being practised by all the great



bodies of Jews and Christians, it had, and still has, to me a



great significance, both religious and historic. In the



cathedrals of the continent of Europe--and I have visited every



one of note except those of Spain--I cared little for what



Browning's bishop calls "the blessed mutter of the mass," but the



chanting of the Psalter always attracted me. Many were the hours



during which I sat at vespers in abbeys and cathedrals, listening



to the Latin psalms until they became almost as familiar to me as



the English Psalter. On the other hand, I was at times greatly



repelled by perfunctory performances of the service, both



Protestant and Catholic. The "Te Deum" which I once heard recited



by an Anglican clergyman in the chapel at the castle of Homburg



dwells in my memory as one of the worst things of its kind I ever



heard, and especially there remains a vivid remembrance of the



invocation, which ran as follows:







"Ha-a-ow-ly, Ha-a-a-ow-ly, Ha-a-ow-ly: La-a-rd Gawd of Sabbith!"







But this was not the only thing of the kind, for I have heard



utterances nearly, if not quite, as bad in various English



cathedrals,--as bad, indeed, as the famous reading, "He that hath



yeahs to yeah, let him yeah."







As to more important religious influences, I had, during my first



visit to Oxford in 1853, a chance to understand something of the



two currents of thought then showing themselves in the English



Church. On a Sunday morning I went to Christ Church Cathedral to



hear the regius professor of Hebrew, Dr. Jacobson, whom, years



afterward, I saw enthroned as bishop in the cathedral at Chester.



It is a church beautiful in itself, and consecrated not only by



the relics of mediaeval saints, but by the devotions of many



generations of scholars, statesmen, and poets; and in front of



the pulpit were a body of young men, the most promising in Great



Britain; yet a more dull, mechanical discourse could not be



imagined. The preacher maundered on like a Tartar praying-mill;



every hearer clearly regarding his discourse as an Arab regards a



sand-storm.







In the afternoon I went to St. Mary's, and heard the regular



university sermon, before a similar audience, by Fraser, a fellow



of Oriel College. It was not oratorical, but straightforward,



earnest, and in a line of thought which enlisted my sympathies.



The young preacher especially warned his audience that if the



Church of England was to remain the Church of England, she must



put forth greater efforts than any she had made for many years;



and he went on to point out some of the lines on which these



exertions should be made,--lines which, I am happy to say, have



since been taken by great numbers of excellent men of the



Anglican communion.







During the evening, in the dining-room of the Mitre Inn, I



happened to be seated at table with an old country clergyman who



had just entered his son at Oxford and was evidently a rural



parson of the good old high-and-dry sort; but as I happened to



speak of the sermons of the day, he burst out in a voice gruff



with theological contempt and hot toddy: "Did you hear that young



upstart this afternoon? Did you ever hear such nonsense? Why



couldn't he mind his own business, as Dr. Jacobson did?"







Nor did sermons from Anglican bishops which I heard at that



period greatly move me. The primate of that day, Dr. Sumner,



impressed me by his wig, but not otherwise. He was, I think, the



last archbishop of Canterbury who used this means of enhancing



his dignity. Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford, was far better; but,



after all, though his preaching showed decided ability, it was



not of the sort to impress one deeply, from either the religious



or the intellectual point of view.







Then, and at various times since, I have obtained more from



simpler forms of worship and less pretentious expositions of the



Gospel.







As to religious influence in France, there was little. I lived in



the family of a French professor, a devout Catholic, but Gallican



in his ideas,--so much so that he often said that if he could



wake up some morning and hear that the Pope had been dispossessed



of his temporal power, it would be the happiest day of his life,



since he was persuaded that nothing had so hampered the



church--and, indeed, debased it--as the limits imposed upon the



papacy by its sovereignty over the Roman states.







A happy impression was made upon me by the simple, philanthropic



character of the Archbishop of Paris at that period--Sibour.



Visiting a technical school which he had established for artisans



in the Faubourg St. Antoine, I derived thence a great respect for



him as a man who was really something more than a "solemnly



constituted impostor"; but, like the archbishops of Paris who



preceded and followed him, he met a violent death, and I have



more than once visited and reflected over the simple tablet which



marks the spot in the Church of St. etienne du Mont where a



wretched, unfrocked priest assassinated this gentle, kindly,



affectionate prelate, who, judging from his appearance and life,



never cherished an unkind feeling toward any human being.







The touching monuments at Notre Dame to his predecessor, Affre,



shot on the barricades in 1848 when imploring a cessation of



bloodshed, and to his successor Darboy, shot by the Communards in



the act of blessing his murderers, also became, at a later



period, places of pilgrimage for me, and did much to keep alive



my faith that, despite all efforts to erect barriers of hatred



between Christians, there is, already, "one fold and one



shepherd."







As to my life on the Continent in general, German Protestantism



seemed to me simple and dignified; but its main influence upon me



was exercised through its music, the "Gloria in Excelsis" of the



morning service at the Berlin Cathedral being the most beautiful



music by a choir I had ever heard,--far superior, indeed, to the



finest choirs of the Sistine or Pauline chapel at Rome; and a



still deeper impression was made upon me by the congregational



singing. Often, after the first notes given by the organ, I have



heard a vast congregation, without book of any kind, joining in



the choral, King Frederick William IV and his court standing and



singing earnestly with the rest. It was a vast uprolling storm of



sound. Standing in the midst of it, one understands the Lutheran



Reformation.







The most impressive Roman Catholic ceremonies which I saw in



Europe were in Germany, and they were impressive because simple



and reverential; those most so being at Wurzburg and Fulda,



where, in the great churches, large bodies of the peasantry



joined simply and naturally in the singing at the mass and at



vespers.







In Russia I had the opportunity to study a religion of a very



different sort--the Russo-Greek Church. While this church no



doubt contains many devoted Christian men and women, it is, on



the whole, a fossilized system; the vast body of the people being



brought up to rely mainly on fetishes of various sorts. The



services were, many of them, magnificent, and the music most



beautiful; but it was discouraging to reflect that the condition



of the Russian peasantry, ignorant, besotted, and debased, was



the outcome of so many centuries of complete control by this



great branch of the Christian Church. It had for ages possessed



the fullest power for developing the intellect, the morals, and



the religion of the people, and here was the result. Experience



of Russian life is hardly calculated to increase, in any thinking



man, confidence in its divine origin or guidance. One bears in



mind at such times the words of the blessed Founder of



Christianity himself, "By their fruits ye shall know them."







But the most unfavorable impression was made upon me in Italy. It



was the palmy period of reactionary despotism. Hapsburgs in the



north, Neapolitan Bourbons in the south, petty tyrants scattered



through the country, all practically doing their worst; and, in



their midst, Pius IX, maintained in the temporal power by French



bayonets. It was the time when the little Jewish child Mortara



was taken from his parents, in spite of their agonizing appeals



to all Europe; when the Madiai family were imprisoned for reading



the Bible with their friends in their own house; when monks



swarmed everywhere, gross and dirty; when, at the centers of



power, the Jesuits had it all their own way,--as they generally



do when the final exasperating impulse is needed to bring on a



revolution. All old abuses of the church were at their highest



flavor. So far as ceremonial was concerned, nothing could be more



gorgeous than the services at St. Peter's as conducted by Pope



Pius IX. For such duties no one could be better fitted; for he



was handsome, kindly, and dignified, with a beautiful, ringing



voice.







During Holy Week of 1856 I was present at various services in



which he took the main part, in the Sistine Chapel and elsewhere;



but most striking of all were his celebration of pontifical high



mass beneath the dome of St. Peter's on Easter morning, and his



appearance on the balcony in front of the cathedral afterward.



The effect of the first ceremony was somewhat injured by the



easy-going manners of some of the attendant cardinals. It was



difficult to imagine that they believed really in the tremendous



doctrine involved in the mass when one saw them taking snuff in



the midst of the most solemn prayers, and going through the whole



in the most perfunctory fashion. At the close of the service, the



Pope, being borne on his throne by Roman nobles, surrounded by



cardinals and princes, and wearing the triple crown, gave his



blessing to the city and to the world. There must have been over



ten thousand of us in the piazza to receive it, and no one could



have performed his part more perfectly. Arising from his throne,



and stretching forth his hands with a striking gesture, he



chanted a benediction heard by every one present, even to the



remotest corners of the square. Many years afterward, Lord Odo



Russell, British ambassador at Berlin, on my mentioning the



splendor of this ceremony to him, said to me, "Yes, you are



right; but it was on one of those occasions that I discovered



that the Pope was mortal." On my asking him how it was, he said,



"I had occasion, as the British diplomatic representative, to



call on Pope Pius IX on Easter Monday, and, after finishing my



business with him, told him that I had been present at the



benediction in front of St. Peter's on the day before, and had



been much impressed by the beauty of his voice; and I added,



'Your Holiness must have been trained as a singer.' At this the



Pope was evidently greatly pleased, and answered, 'You are right,



I WAS trained as a singer; BUT YOU OUGHT TO HAVE HEARD ME TWO OR



THREE YEARS AGO.' "







But while these great services at St. Peter's in those halcyon



days were perfect in their kind, the same could not be said of



many others. The worst that I ever saw--one which especially



dwells in my memory--was at Pisa. I had previously visited the



place and knew it well, so that when, one Sunday morning, a



Canadian clergyman at the hotel wished to go to the cathedral, I



offered to guide him. He was evidently a man of deep sincerity,



and, as was soon revealed by his conversation, of high-church and



even ritualistic tendencies; but, to my great surprise, he



remarked that he had never attended service in a Roman Catholic



church. Arriving at the cathedral too late for the high



celebration, we walked down the nave until we came to a side



altar where a priest was going through a low mass, with a small



congregation of delayed worshipers, and we took our place back of



these. The priest raced through the service at the highest



possible speed. His motions were like those of an automaton: he



kept turning quickly to and fro as if on a pivot; clasping his



hands before his breast as if by machinery; bowing his head as if



it moved by a spring in his neck; mumbling and rattling like wind



in a chimney; the choir-boy who served the mass with him jingling



his bell as irreverently as if he were conducting a



green-grocer's cart. My Anglican companion immediately began to



be unhappy, and was soon deeply distressed. He groaned again and



again. He whispered, "Good heavens, is it like this? Is this the



way they do it? This is fearful!" As we came from the church he



was very sorrowful, and I administered to him such comfort as I



could, but nothing could remedy this most painful disenchantment.







And here I may say that I have never been able to understand how



any Anglican churchman can feel any insufficiency in the Lord's



Supper as administered in his own branch of the church. I have



never taken part in it, but more than once I have lingered to see



it, and even in its simplest form it has always greatly impressed



me. It is a service which all can understand; its words have come



down through the ages; its ceremonial is calm, comprehensible,



touching; and the whole idea of communion in memory of the last



scene in the Saviour's life, which brings the worshiper into



loving relation not only with him, but with all the church,



militant and triumphant, is, to my mind, infinitely nobler and



more religious than all paraphernalia, genuflexions, and



man-millinery. How any Protestant, however "high" in his



tendencies, can feel otherwise is incomprehensible to me.







At that first of my many visits to Rome, there had come one



experience which had greatly softened any of my inherited



Protestant prejudices. Our party had been lumbering along all day



on the road from Civita Vecchia, when suddenly there dashed by us



a fine traveling-coach drawn by four horses ridden by postilions.



Hardly had it passed when there came a scream, and our carriage



stopped. We at first took it for granted that it was an attack by



bandits, but, on getting out and approaching the other coach,



found that one of the postilions, a beautiful Italian boy of



sixteen, in jaunty costume, had been thrown from his horse, had



been run over by the wheels of the coach, and now lay at the



roadside gasping his last. We stood about him, trying to ease his



pain, when a young priest came running from a neighboring church.



He showed no deference to the gorgeously dressed personages who



had descended from the coach; he was regardless of all



conventionalities, oblivious of all surroundings, his one thought



being evidently of his duty to the poor sufferer stretched out



before him. He knelt, tenderly kissed the boy, administered



extreme unction, and repeated softly and earnestly the prayers



for the dying, to which fervent responses came from the peasants



kneeling about him. The whole scene did much to tone down the



feelings which had been aroused the previous day by the filth and



beggary at the papal port where we had landed, and to prepare me



for a more charitable judgment of what I was to see in the papal



city.







But an early experience in Rome showed a less beautiful



manifestation of Christian zeal. We were a band of students, six



in number, who had just closed a year of study at the University



of Berlin; and the youngest, whom I will call Jack Smith, was a



bright young fellow, son of a wealthy New England manufacturer.



The evening after arriving in Rome, Jack, calling on an American



aunt, was introduced to a priest who happened to be making her a



visit. It was instantly evident that the priest, Father Cataldi,



knew what Jack's worldly prospects were; for from the first he



was excessively polite to the youth, and when the latter remarked



that during his stay in Rome he would like to take Italian



lessons, the priest volunteered to send him a teacher. Next day,



at the appointed hour, the teacher appeared, and in the person of



the priest himself. Thenceforward he stuck to the young American



like a brother, kept him away from the rest of us as much as



possible, and served not only as his teacher, but as his



cicerone.







Among various dignitaries to whom he presented the young American



was his Eminence Cardinal Tosti; and when the cardinal extended



his hand to be kissed, Jack grasped and cordially shook it. The



two clerical gentlemen were evidently disconcerted; but the



priest said to the cardinal, in an undertone, "e un principe



Americano," whereupon the cardinal seemed relieved and shook



hands heartily.







One day, when the priest was not with our companion, we all



visited one of the basilicas, where some great function was going



on, and, though we found a crowd at the doors, obtained a sight



of the high altar,--and there, in magnificent attire, in the



midst of the great prelates, was a person who bore a most



striking resemblance to Jack's clerical guide. We were all struck



by this curious coincidence, but concluded that in the distance



and through the clouds of incense we had simply seen a chance



resemblance, and in the multitude of matters we soon forgot it. A



month afterward, as we were leaving Rome, Jack asked his new



friend for his bill, whereupon the priest drew himself up with a



superb gesture and, presenting his card, said: "You evidently do



not know who I am." The card bore the inscription, "Monsignor



Cataldi, Master of the Papal Ceremonies." The young American was



quite confounded, but listened submissively while this dignitary



expressed the hope that they might yet meet within the pale of



that church which alone could give a claim to salvation.







The condition of Rome at that period was not such as to induce



much respect for priestly government. Anything more dirty,



slipshod, and wretched could hardly be imagined. No railways had



yet been allowed; the Vatican monsignori feeling by instinct the



truth stated by Buckle, that railways promote the coming in of



new ideas. Nor did the moral condition of the people seem to be



any better.







Any one who visits Rome to-day, with the army of monks swept out



of the place, with streets well cleaned, with the excavations



scientifically conducted, with a government which, whatever its



faults, is at any rate patriotic, finds it difficult to imagine



the vileness of the city under the old regime.







But, bad as was Rome, Naples was worse. The wretched Bourbon then



on the throne, "King Bomba," was the worst of his kind. Our



minister of that period, Mr. Robert Dale Owen, gave me some



accounts of the condition of things. He told me, as a matter of



fact, that any young man showing earnest purpose of any sort was



immediately suspected and discouraged, while worthless young



debauchees were regarded as harmless, and therefore favored.







The most cherished counselor of the King was Apuzzo, Archbishop



of Sorrento. In addition to what I have already said of



Leopardi's political catechism, which the archbishop forced upon



the people, I may note that this work took great pains to show



that no education was needed save just enough to enable each man



to accomplish his duties within the little sphere in which he was



born, and that for the great body of the people education was a



curse rather than a blessing. The result of this policy was



evident: the number of persons unable to read or write, which was



from forty to fifty per cent. in Piedmont, was from sixty to



sixty-five per cent. in Rome, from eighty to eighty-five per



cent. in the Papal States, and above eighty-five per cent. in



Naples and Sicily.[38]











[38] See maps in Vol. II, of "L'Italis Economica nel 1873" (Roma,



Tipografia Barbera, 1873). This work was the result of official



surveys and most careful studies made by leading economists and



statisticians. For a copy of it I am indebted to Mr. H. N. Gay,



Fellow of Harvard University.











I also had the advantage of being present at the great religious



function of Naples--the liquefaction of the blood of St.



Januarius, patron of the city. It was in the gorgeous chapel of



the saint which forms part of the Cathedral of Naples, and the



place was filled with devout worshipers of every class, from the



officials in court dress, representing the Bourbon king, down to



the lowest lazzaroni. The reliquary of silver gilt, shaped like a



large human head, and supposed to contain the skull of the saint,



was first placed upon the altar; next, two vials, containing a



dark substance said to be his blood, were also placed upon the



altar, near the head. As the priests said prayers, they turned



the vials from time to time; and, the liquefaction being somewhat



delayed, the great crowd of people burst out into more and more



impassioned expostulations and petitions to the saint. Just in



front of the altar were the lazzaroni who claimed to be



descendants of the saint's family, and these were especially



importunate: at such times they beg, they scold, they even



threaten; they have been known to abuse the saint roundly, and to



tell him that, if he does not care to show his favor to the city



by liquefying his blood, St. Cosmo and St. Damian are just as



good saints as he, and will, no doubt, be very glad to have the



city devote itself to them. At last, as we were beginning to be



impatient, the priest, turning the vials suddenly, announced that



the saint had performed the miracle, and instantly priests,



people, choir, and organ burst forth into a great "Te Deum";



bells rang and cannon roared; a procession was formed, and the



shrine containing the saint's relics was carried through the



streets, the people prostrating themselves on both sides of the



way and showering rose-leaves upon the shrine and upon the path



before it. The contents of these precious vials are an



interesting relic indeed, for they represent to us vividly that



period when men who were willing to go to the stake for their



religious opinions thought it not wrong to "save souls" by pious



mendacity and consecrated fraud. To the scientific eye this



miracle is very simple: the vials contain, no doubt, one of those



waxy mixtures fusing at low temperature, which, while kept in its



place within the cold stone walls of the church, remains solid,



but which, upon being brought out into the hot, crowded chapel



and fondled by the warm hands of the priests, gradually softens



and becomes liquid. It was curious to note, at the time above



mentioned, that even the high functionaries representing the King



looked at the miracle with awe: they evidently found "joy in



believing," and one of them assured me that the only thing which



COULD cause it was the direct exercise of miraculous power.







So, too, I had here an opportunity to study one of the



fundamental ideas of the prevalent theology--namely, the doctrine



of "intercession," which has played such a part not only in



Catholic but in Protestant countries,--the idea that, just as in



an earthly court back-stairs influence is necessary to secure



favor, so it must be in the heavenly courts. I was much edified



by the way in which this doctrine was presented in certain great



pictures representing the intervention of the Almighty to save



Naples from the plague. One of them, as I remember it,



represented, on an enormous canvas, the whole transaction as



follows: In the immediate foreground the people of Naples were



represented on their knees before their magistrates, begging them



to rescue the city from the pestilence; farther back the



magistrates were represented as on their knees before the monks,



begging for their prayers; the monks were on their knees before



St. Januarius, begging him to intervene; St. Januarius was then



represented as on his knees before the Blessed Virgin; the



Blessed Virgin was then pictured as beseeching her divine Son;



and he at last was represented as presenting the petition to a



triangle in the heavens behind which appeared the lineaments of a



venerable face.







One can understand, after seeing pictures of this kind, what



Erasmus was thinking of, five hundred years ago, when he wrote



his colloquy of "The Shipwreck," the most exquisite satire on



mediaeval doctrine ever made. After a most comical account of the



petitions and promises made by the shipwrecked to various saints,



Adolphus says: "To which of the saints did you pray?" Antony



answers, "To not one of them all, I assure you. I don't like your



way of bargaining with the saints: 'Do this and I 'll do that.



Here is so much for so much. Save me and I will give you a taper



or go on a pilgrimage.' Just think of it! I should certainly have



prayed to St. Peter, if to any saint; for he stands at the door



of heaven, and so would be likeliest to hear. But before he could



go to the Almighty and tell him my condition, I might be fifty



fathoms under water." Adolphus: "What did you do then?" Antony:



"I went straight to God himself, and said my prayer to him; the



saints neither hear so readily nor give so willingly."







In the city itself were filth, blasphemy, and obscenity



unspeakable. No stranger could take his seat at a cafe without



having proposals openly made to him which would have disgraced



Pompeii. Cheatery and lying prevailed on all sides. Outside the



city was brigandage,--so much so that various parties going to



Paestum took pains to combine their forces and to bear arms.







This, then, was the outcome of fifteen hundred years of Christian



civilization in a land which had been entirely in the hands of



the church authorities ever since the downfall of the Roman



Empire; a country in which education, intellectual, moral, and



religious, had been from the first in the hands of a body,



claiming infallibility in its teaching of faith and morals, which



had molded rulers and people at its own will during all these



centuries. This was the result! It seemed to me then, as it seems



to me now, a reductio ad absurdum of the claims of any church to



superintend the education of a people; and if it be insisted that



there is anything exceptional in Italy, one may point for



examples of the same results to Spain, the Spanish republics,



Poland, and sundry other countries.







Before going to Italy, I had taken pains to read as much as



possible of the history of the country, and, among other works,



had waded through the ten octavo volumes of Sismondi's "History



of the Italian Republics," as well as Gibbon's "Decline and Fall



of the Roman Empire"; and this history had served to show me what



any body of ecclesiastics, not responsible to sound lay opinion,



may become. In looking over the past history and present



condition of Italy, there constantly rang in my ears that great



warning by Christ himself, "By their fruits ye shall know them."















CHAPTER LXI







IN LATER YEARS--1856-1905







On my return to America I remained for a short time as a resident



graduate at New Haven, and there gained a friend who influenced



me most happily. This was Professor George Park Fisher, at that



time in charge of the university pulpit, an admirable scholar and



historian. His religious nature, rooted in New England orthodoxy,



had come to a broad and noble bloom and fruitage. Witty and



humorous, while deeply thoughtful, his discussions were of great



value to me, and our long walks together remain among the most



pleasing recollections of my life. He had a genius for



conversation; in fact, he was one of the two or three best



conversationists I have ever known, and his influence on my



thinking, both as regards religious and secular questions, was



thoroughly good. While we did not by any means fully agree, I



came to see more clearly than ever what a really enlightened



Christianity can do for a man.







I had returned to America in the hope of influencing opinion from



a professor's chair, and my dear old friend Professor--afterward



President--Porter urged me to remain in New Haven, assuring me



that the professorship of history for which I had been preparing



myself abroad would be open to me there. A few years later a



professorship at Yale was offered me, and in a way for which I



shall always be grateful; but it was not the professorship of



history: from that I was debarred by my religious views, and



therefore it was that, having been elected to a professorship in



that department at the State University of Michigan, I



immediately and gladly entered upon its duties.







Installed in this new position at Ann Arbor, I not only threw



myself very heartily into my work, but became interested in



church and other good work as it went on about me. From the force



of old associations, and because my family had also been brought



up in the Episcopal Church, I attended its services regularly;



and, while it represented much that I could not accept, there



were noble men in it who became my very dear friends, with whom I



was glad to work.







It has always seemed to me rather an amusing episode in my life



during this period that, in spite of grave doubts regarding my



orthodoxy, my friends elected me vestryman of St. Andrew's Church



at Ann Arbor, and gave me full power to select and call a rector



for the parish at my next vacation excursion in the East. This in



due time I proceeded to do. Attending the convention of the



Episcopal Church in the diocese of Western New York, I consulted



with various clerical friends, visited one or two places in order



to hear sundry clergymen who were recommended to me, and at last



called to our rectorate a man who proved to be not only a



blessing to that parish, but to the State at large. In the annals



of American charitable work his name is writ large, though



probably there never lived a man more averse to publicity. He has



since been made a bishop, and in that capacity has shown the same



self-sacrifice and devotion to works of mercy which marked his



career as pastor.







As to my religious ideas in general, they were at that time



influenced in various ways. I read much ecclesiastical history as



given by leading authorities, Protestant and Catholic, and in



various original treatises by thinkers eminent in the history of



the church. A marked influence was exercised upon me by reading



sundry lives of the mediaeval saints: even the quaintest of these



showed me how, in spite of childlike credulity, most noble lives



had been led, well worthy to be pondered over in these later



centuries.







The general effect of this reading was to arouse in me admiration



for the men who have taken leading parts in developing the great



religions of the world, and especially Christianity, whether



Catholic or Protestant; but it also caused me to distrust, more



and more, every sort of theological dogmatism. More and more



clear it became that ecclesiastical dogmas are but steps in the



evolution of various religions, and that, in view of the fact



that the main underlying ideas are common to all, a beneficent



evolution is to continue.







This latter idea was strengthened by my careful reading of Sale's



translation of the Koran, which showed me that even Mohammedanism



is not wholly the tissue of folly and imposture which in those



days it was generally represented to be.







Influence was also exerted upon me by various other books, and



especially by Fra Paolo Sarpi's "History of the Council of



Trent," probably the most racy and pungent piece of



ecclesiastical history ever written; and though I also read as



antidotes the history of the Council by Pallavicini, and copious



extracts from Bossuet, Archbishop Spalding, and Balmez, Father



Paul taught me, as an Italian historian phrases it, "how the Holy



Spirit conducts church councils." At a later period Dean Stanley



made a similar revelation in his account of the Council of



Nicaea.







The works of Buckle, Lecky, and Draper, which were then



appearing, laid open much to me. All these authors showed me how



temporary, in the sum of things, is any popular theology; and,



finally, the dawn of the Darwinian hypothesis came to reveal a



whole new orb of thought absolutely fatal to the claims of



various churches, sects, and sacred books to contain the only or



the final word of God to man. The old dogma of "the fall of man"



had soon fully disappeared, and in its place there rose more and



more into view the idea of the rise of man.







But while my view was thus broadened, no hostility to religion



found lodgment in my mind: of all the books which I read at that



time, Stanley's life of Arnold exercised the greatest influence



upon me. It showed that a man might cast aside much which



churches regard as essential, and might strive for breadth and



comprehension in Christianity, while yet remaining in healthful



relations with the church. I also read with profit and pleasure



the Rev. Thomas Beecher's book, "Our Seven Churches," which



showed that each Christian sect in America has a certain work to



do, and does it well; also, the sermons of Robertson, Phillips



Brooks, and Theodore Munger, which revealed a beauty in



Christianity before unknown to me.







Another influence was of a very different sort. From time to time



I went on hunting excursions with the pastor of the Methodist



Episcopal church at Ann Arbor; and though he made no parade of



religion, there was in him a genial, manly piety which bettered



me.







But I cannot say that this good influence was always exercised



upon me by his coreligionists. There was especially one, who rose



to be a "presiding elder," very narrow, very shrewd, and very



bitter against the State University, yet constantly placing



himself in comical dilemmas. On one occasion, when I asked him



regarding his relations with clergymen of other religious bodies,



he spoke of the Roman Catholics and said that he had made a



determined effort to convert the Bishop of Detroit. On my asking



for particulars, he answered that, calling upon the bishop, he



had spoken very solemnly to him and told him that he was



endangering his own salvation as well as that of his flock; that



at first the bishop was evidently inclined to be harsh; but that,



on finding that he --the Methodist brother--disliked the



Presbyterian Dr. Duffield, who had recently attacked Catholic



doctrine, as much as the bishop did, the relations between them



grew better, so that they talked together very amicably.







At this point in our conversation a puzzled expression overspread



the elder's face and he said, "The most singular experience I



ever had was with a French Catholic priest in Monroe. Being in



that town and having a day or two of vacation, I felt it my duty



to go and remonstrate with him. I found him very polite,



especially after I had told him that his bishop had received me



and discussed religious questions with me. Presently, wishing to



make an impression on the priest, I fixed my eyes on him very



earnestly and said as solemnly as I could, 'Do you know that you



are leading your flock straight down to hell?' To this the priest



made a very singular answer,--very singular, indeed. He said,



'Did you talk like that to the bishop?' I answered, 'Yes, I did.'



'Didn't he kick you out of his house?' 'No, he didn't.' 'Then,'



said the priest, '_I_ won't.' " And the good elder, during the



whole of this story, evidently thought that the point of it was,



somehow, against the PRIEST!







As a professor at the University of Michigan lecturing upon



modern history, I, of course, showed my feelings in opposition to



slavery, which was then completely dominant in the nation, and,



to all appearance, intrenched in our institutions forever. From



time to time I also said some things which made the more



sensitive orthodox brethren uneasy; though, as I look back upon



them now, they seem to me very mild indeed. In these days they



could be said, and would be said, by great numbers of devoted



members of all Christian churches. These expressions of mine



favored toleration and dwelt upon the absurdity of distinctions



between Christians on account of beliefs which individuals or



communities have happened to inherit. Nothing like an attack upon



Christianity itself, or upon anything vital to it, did I ever



make; indeed, my inclinations were not in that direction: my



greatest desire was to set men and women at thinking, for I felt



sure that if they would really think, in the light of human



history, they would more and more dwell on what is permanent in



Christianity and less and less on what is transient; more and



more on its universal truths, less and less upon the creeds,



forms, and observances in which these gems are set; more and more



on what draws men together, less and less on that which keeps



them apart.







I became convinced that what the world needed was more religion



rather than less; more devotion to humanity and less preaching of



dogmas. Whenever I spoke of religion, it was not to say a word



against any existing form; but I especially referred, as my



ideals of religious conduct, to the declaration of Micah,



beginning with the words, "What doth the Lord require of thee?";



to the Sermon on the Mount; to the definition of "pure religion



and undefiled" given by St. James; and to some of the wonderful



utterances of St. Paul. But even this alarmed two or three very



good men; they were much exercised over what they called my



"indifferentism"; and when I was chosen, somewhat later, to the



presidency of Cornell University, I found that they had thought



it their duty to write letters urging various trustees to prevent



the election of so dangerous a heretic.







Scattered through the Michigan university town were a number of



people who had broken from the old faith and were groping about



to find a new one, but, as a rule, with such insufficient



knowledge of the real basis of belief or skepticism that the



religion they found seemed less valuable to them than the one



they had left. Thiers, Voltairian though he was, has well said,



"The only altars which are not ridiculous are the old altars."







Some of the best of these people, having lost very dear children,



had taken refuge in what was called "spiritualism"; and I was



invited to witness some of the "manifestations from the



spirit-land," and assured that they would leave no doubt in my



mind as to their tremendous reality. Among those who thus invited



me were a county judge of high standing, and his wife, one of the



most lovely and accomplished of women. They had lost their only



daughter, a beautiful creature just budding into womanhood, and



they thought that "spiritualism" had given her back to them. As



they told me wonderful things regarding the revelations made by



sundry eminent mediums, I accepted their invitation to witness



some of these, and went to the seances with a perfectly open and



impartial mind. I saw nothing antecedently improbable in



phenomena of that sort; indeed, it seemed to me that it might be



a blessed thing if there were really something in it all; but



examination showed me in this, as in all other cases where I have



investigated so-called "spirit revelations," nothing save the



worthlessness of human testimony to the miraculous. These



miracles were the cheapest and poorest of jugglery, and the



mediums were, without exception, of a type below contempt. There



was, indeed, a revelation to me, not of a spirit-world beyond the



grave, but of a spirit-world about me, peopled with the spirits



of good and loving men and women who find "joy in believing" what



they wish to believe. Compared with this new worship, I felt that



the old was infinitely more honest, substantial, and healthful;



and never since have I desired to promote revolutionary changes



in religion. Such changes, to be good, must be evolutionary,



gradual, and in obedience to slowly increasing knowledge: such a



change is now evidently going on, irresistibly, and quite as



rapidly as is desirable.







There were other singular experiences. One day a student said to



me that an old man living not far from the university grounds was



very ill and wished to see me. I called at once, and found him



stretched out on his bed and greatly emaciated with consumption.



He was a Hicksite Quaker. As I entered the room he said, "Friend,



I hear good things of thee: thou art telling the truth; let me



bear my testimony before thee. I believe in God and in a future



life, but in little else which the churches teach. I am dying.



Within two or three days, at furthest, I shall be in my coffin.



Yet I look on the future with no anxiety; I am in the hands of my



loving Father, and have no more fear of passing through the gate



of death into the future life than of passing through yonder door



into the next room." After kindly talk I left him, and next day



learned that he had quietly passed away.







After about five years of duty in the University of Michigan, I



was brought into the main charge of the newly established Cornell



University; and in this new position, while no real change took



place in my fundamental religious ideas, there were conflicting



influences, sometimes unfortunate, but in the main happy. In



other chapters of these reminiscences I have shown to what unjust



attacks the new institution and all connected with it were



subjected by the agents and votaries of various denominational



colleges. At times this embittered me, but the ultimate result



always was that it stirred me to new efforts. Whatever ill



feelings arose from these onslaughts were more than made up after



the establishment of the Sage Chapel pulpit. I have shown



elsewhere how, at my instance, provision was made by a



public-spirited man for calling the most distinguished preachers



of all denominations, and how, the selection of these having been



left to me, I chose them from the most eminent men in the various



Christian bodies. My intercourse with these, as well as my



hearing their discourses, broadened and deepened my religious



feeling, and I regard this as among the especially happy things



of my life.







Another feature of the university was not so helpful to me. I



have spoken in another chapter regarding the establishment of



Barnes Hall at Cornell as a center of work for the Christian



Association and other religious organizations of the university,



and of my pleasure in aiding the work there done and in noting



its good results. At various times I attended the services of the



Young Men's Christian Association; and while they often touched



me, I cannot say that they always edified me. I am especially



fond of the psalms attributed to David, which are, for me, the



highest of poetry; and I am also very fond of the great and noble



hymns of the church, Catholic and Protestant, and especially



susceptible to the best church music, from Bach and Handel to



Mason and Neale: but the sort of revival hymns which are



generally sung in Christian Associations, and which date mainly



from the Moody and Sankey period, do not appeal to my best



feelings in any respect. They seem to me very thin and gushy.



This feeling of mine is not essentially unorthodox, for I once



heard it expressed by an eminent orthodox clergyman in terms much



stronger than any which I have ever used. Said he, "When I was



young, congregations used to sing such psalms as this:







 "The Lord descended from above,



      And bowed the heavens most high;



  And underneath His feet He cast



      The darkness of the sky.







 "On cherubim and seraphim



      Right royally He rode,



  And on the wings of mighty winds



      Came flying all abroad.







 "His seat is on the mighty floods,



      Their fury to restrain;



  And He, our everlasting Lord,



      Forevermore shall reign.







"But now," he continued, "the congregation gets together and a



lot of boys and girls sing:







 "Lawd, how oft I long to know--



     Oft it gives me anxious thought--



 Do I love Thee, Lawd, or no;



      Am I Thine, or am I nawt!







"There," said he, "is the difference between a religion which



believes in a righteous sovereign Ruler of the universe, and a



maudlin sentiment incapable of any real, continued, determined



effort."







I must confess that this view of my orthodox friend strikes me as



just. It seems to me that one of the first needs of large



branches of the Christian Church is to weed out a great mass of



sickly, sentimental worship of no one knows what, and to replace



it with psalms and hymns which show a firm reliance upon the Lord



God Almighty.







It is with this view that I promoted in the university chapel the



simple antiphonal reading of the psalms by the whole



congregation. Best of all would it be to chant the Psalter; the



clergyman, with a portion of the choir, leading on one side, and



the other section of the choir and the congregation at large



chanting the responses. But this is, as regards most Protestant



churches, a counsel of perfection.







Staying in London after the close of my university presidency, I



was subject to another influence which has wrought with power



upon some strong men. It was my wont to attend service in some



one of the churches interesting from a historical point of view



or holding out the prospect of a good sermon; but, probably, a



combination which I occasionally made would not be approved by my



more orthodox fellow-churchmen. For at times I found pleasure and



profit in attending the service before sermon on Sunday afternoon



at St. Paul's, and then going to the neighboring Positivist



Conventicle in Fetter Lane to hear Frederic Harrison and others.



Harrison's discourses were admirable, and one upon Roman



civilization was most suggestive of fruitful thought. My tendency



has always been strongly toward hero-worship, and this feature of



the Positivist creed and practice especially attracted me; while



the superb and ennobling music of St. Paul's kept me in a



religious atmosphere during any discourse which succeeded it.







My favorite reading at this period was the "Bible for Learners,"



a book most thoughtfully edited by three of the foremost scholars



of modern Europe--Hooykaas, Oort, and Kuenen. Simple as the book



is, it made a deep impression upon me, rehabilitating the Bible



in my mind, showing it to be a collection of literature and moral



truths unspeakably precious to all Christian nations and to every



Christian man. At a later period, readings in the works of Renan,



Pfleiderer, Cheyne, Harnack, Sayce, and others strengthened me in



my liberal tendencies, without diminishing in the slightest my



reverence for all that is noble in Christianity, past or present.







Another experience, while it did not perhaps set me in any new



trains of thought, strengthened me in some of my earlier views.



This was the revelation to me of Mohammedanism during my journey



in the East. While Mohammedan fanaticism seems to me one of the



great misfortunes of the world, Mohammedan worship, as I first



saw it, made a deep impression on me. Our train was slowly moving



into Cairo, and stopped for a time just outside the city; the



Pyramids were visible in the distance, but my thoughts were



turned from them by a picture in the foreground. Under a



spreading palm-tree, a tall Egyptian suddenly arose to his full



height, took off an outer covering from his shoulders, laid it



upon the ground, and then solemnly prostrated himself and went



through his prayers, addressing them in the direction of Mecca.



He was utterly oblivious of the crowd about him, and the



simplicity, directness, and reverence in his whole movement



appealed to me strongly. At various other times, on the desert,



in the bazaars, in the mosques, and on the Nile boats, I



witnessed similar scenes, and my broad-churchmanship was thereby



made broader. Nor was this general effect diminished by my visit



to the howling and whirling dervishes. The manifestations of



their zeal ranged themselves clearly in the same category with



those evident in American campmeetings, and I now understood



better than ever what the Rev. Dr. Bacon of New Haven meant when,



after returning from the East, he alluded to certain Christian



"revivalists" as "howling dervishes."







I must say, too, that while I loved and admired many Christian



missionaries whom I saw in the East, and rejoiced in the work of



their schools, the utter narrowness of some of them was



discouraging. Anything more cold, forbidding, and certain of



extinction than the worship of the "United Presbyterians" at the



mission church at Cairo I have never seen, save possibly that of



sundry Calvinists at Paris. Nor have I ever heard anything more



defiant of sane thought and right reason than the utterances of



some of these excellent men.







But the general effect of all these experiences, as I now think,



was to aid in a healthful evolution of my religious ideas.







It may now be asked what is the summing up of my relation to



religion, as looked upon in the last years of a long life, during



which I have had many suggestions to thought upon it, many



opportunities to hear eminent religionists of almost every creed



discuss it, and many chances to observe its workings in the



multitude of systems prevalent in various countries.







As a beginning, I would answer that, having for many years



supplemented my earlier observations and studies by special



researches into the relations between science and religion, my



conviction has been strengthened that religion in its true



sense--namely, the bringing of humanity into normal relations



with that Power, not ourselves, in the universe, which makes for



righteousness--is now, as it always has been, a need absolute,



pressing, and increasing.







As to the character of such normal relations, I feel that they



involve a sense of need for worship: for praise and prayer,



public and private. If fine-spun theories are presented as to the



necessary superfluity of praise to a perfect Being, and the



necessary inutility of prayer in a world governed by laws, my



answer is that law is as likely to obtain in the spiritual as in



the natural world: that while it may not be in accordance with



physical laws to pray for the annihilation of a cloud and the



cessation of a rain-storm, it may well be in accordance with



spiritual laws that communication take place between the Infinite



and finite minds; that helpful inspiration may be thus



obtained,--greater power, clearer vision, higher aims.







As to the question between worship by man as an individual being,



face to face with the Divine Power, and worship by human beings



in common, as brethren moved to express common ideas, needs,



hopes, efforts, aspirations, I attribute vast value to both.







As to the first. Each individual of us has perhaps an even more



inadequate conception of "the God and father of us all" than a



plant has of a man; and yet the universal consciousness of our



race obliges a human being under normal conditions to feel the



need of betterment, of help, of thankfulness. It would seem best



for every man to cultivate the thoughts, relations, and practices



which he finds most accordant with such feelings and most



satisfying to such needs.







As to the second. The universal normal consciousness of humanity



seems to demand some form of worship in common with one's



fellow-men. All forms adopted by men under normal conditions,



whether in cathedrals, temples, mosques, or conventicles, clearly



have uses and beauties of their own.







If it be said that all forms of belief or ceremonial obscure that



worship, "in spirit and in truth," which aids high aspiration, my



answer is that the incorporation, in beliefs and forms of



worship, of what man needs for his spiritual sustenance seems to



me analogous to the incorporation in his daily material food of



what he needs for his physical sustenance. As a rule, the truths



necessary for the sustenance and development of his higher nature



would seem better assimilated when incorporated in forms of



belief and worship, public or private, even though these beliefs



and forms have imperfections or inadequacies. We do not support



material life by consuming pure carbon, or nitrogen, or hydrogen:



we take these in such admixtures as our experience shows to be



best for us. We do not live by breathing pure oxygen: we take it



diluted with other gases, and mainly with one which, if taken by



itself, is deadly.







This is but a poor and rough analogy, but it seems a legitimate



illustration of a fact which we must take account of in the whole



history of the human race, past, present, and future.







It will, in my opinion, be a sad day for this or for any people



when there shall have come in them an atrophy of the religious



nature; when they shall have suppressed the need of



communication, no matter how vague, with a supreme power in the



universe; when the ties which bind men of similar modes of



thought in the various religious organizations shall be



dissolved; when men, instead of meeting their fellow-men in



assemblages for public worship which give them a sense of



brotherhood, shall lounge at home or in clubs; when men and



women, instead of bringing themselves at stated periods into an



atmosphere of prayer, praise, and aspiration, to hear the



discussion of higher spiritual themes, to be stirred by appeals



to their nobler nature in behalf of faith, hope, and charity, and



to be moved by a closer realization of the fatherhood of God and



the brotherhood of man, shall stay at home and give their



thoughts to the Sunday papers or to the conduct of their business



or to the languid search for some refuge from boredom.







But thus recognizing the normal need of religious ideas,



feelings, and observances, I see in the history of these an



evolution which has slowly brought our race out of lower forms of



religion into higher, and which still continues. Nowhere is this



more clearly mirrored than in our own sacred books; nowhere more



distinctly seen than in what is going on about us; and one finds



in this evolution, just as in the development of our race in



other fields, survivals of outworn beliefs and observances which



remain as mile-stones to mark human progress.







Belief in a God who is physically, intellectually, and morally



but an enlarged "average man"--unjust, whimsical, revengeful,



cruel, and so far from omnipotent that he has to make all sorts



of interferences to rectify faults in his original scheme--is



more and more fading away among the races controlling the world.







More and more the thinking and controlling races are developing



the power of right reason; and more and more they are leaving to



inferior and disappearing races the methods of theological



dogmatism.







More and more, in all parts of the civilized world, is developing



liberty of thought; and more and more is left behind the tyranny



of formulas.







More and more is developing, in the leading nations, the



conception of the world's sacred books as a literature in which,



as in a mass of earthy material, the gems and gold of its



religious thought are embedded; and more and more is left behind



the belief in the literal, prosaic conformity to fact of all



utterances in this literature.







To one who closely studies the history of humanity, evolution in



religion is a certainty. Eddies there are,--counter-currents of



passion, fanaticism, greed, hate, pride, folly, the unreason of



mobs, the strife of parties, the dreams of mystics, the logic of



dogmatists, and the lust for power of ecclesiastics,--but the



great main tide is unmistakable.







What should be the attitude of thinking men, in view of all this?



History, I think, teaches us that, just so far as is possible,



the rule of our conduct should be to assist Evolution rather than



Revolution. Religious revolution is at times inevitable, and at



such times the rule of conduct should be to unite our efforts to



the forces working for a new and better era; but religious



revolutions are generally futile and always dangerous. As a rule,



they have failed. Even when successful and beneficial, they have



brought new evils. The Lutheran Church, resulting from the great



religious revolution of the sixteenth century, became immediately



after the death of Luther, and remained during generations, more



inexcusably cruel and intolerant than Catholicism had ever been;



the revolution which enthroned Calvinism in large parts of the



British Empire and elsewhere brought new forms of unreason,



oppression, and unhappiness; the revolution in France substituted



for the crudities and absurdities of the old religion a "purified



worship of the Supreme Being" under which came human sacrifices



by thousands, followed by a reaction to an unreason more extreme



than anything previously known. Goldwin Smith was right when he



said, "Let us never glorify revolution."







Christianity, though far short of what it ought to be and will



be, is to-day purer and better, in all its branches, than it has



ever before been; and the same may be said of Judaism. Any man



born into either of these forms of religion should, it seems to



me, before breaking away from it, try as long as possible to



promote its better evolution; aiding to increase breadth of view,



toleration, indifference to unessentials, cooperation with good



men and true of every faith. Melanchthon, St. Francis Xavier,



Grotius, Thomasius, George Fox, Fenelon, the Wesleys, Moses



Mendelssohn, Schleiermacher, Dr. Arnold, Channing, Phillips



Brooks, and their like may well be our exemplars, despite all



their limitations and imperfections.







I grant that there are circumstances which may oblige a



self-respecting man to withdraw from religious organizations and



assemblages. There may be reactionary zeal of rabbis, priests,



deacons, destructive to all healthful advance of thought; there



may be a degeneration of worship into fetishism; there may be



control by young Levites whose minds are only adequate to decide



the colors of altar-cloths and the cut of man-millinery; there



may be control by men of middle age who preach a gospel of



"hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness"; there may be tyranny



by old men who will allow no statements of belief save those



which they learned as children.







From such evils, there are, in America at least, many places of



refuge; and, in case these fail, there are the treasures of



religious thought accumulated from the days of Marcus Aurelius,



St. Augustine, and Thomas a Kempis to such among us as Brooks,



Gibbons, Munger, Henry Simmons, Rabbis Weinstock and Jacobs, and



very many others. It may be allowed to a hard-worked man who has



passed beyond the allotted threescore years and ten to say that



he has found in general religious biography, Jewish, Catholic,



and Protestant, and in the writings of men nobly inspired in all



these fields, a help without which his life would have been poor



indeed.







True, there will be at times need of strong resistance, and



especially of resistance to all efforts by any clerical



combination, whether of rabbis, priests, or ministers, no matter



how excellent, to hamper scientific thought, to control public



education, or to erect barriers and arouse hates between men.



Both Religion and Science have suffered fearfully from unlimited



clerical sway; but of the two, Religion has suffered most.







When one considers the outcome of national education entirely



under the control of the church during over fifteen hundred



years,--in France at the outbreak of the revolution of 1789, in



Italy at the outbreak of the revolution of 1848, in the



Spanish-American republics down to a very recent period, and in



Spain, Poland, and elsewhere at this very hour,--one sees how



delusive is the hope that a return to the ideas and methods of



the "ages of faith" is likely to cure the evils that still linger



among us.







The best way of aiding in a healthful evolution would seem to



consist in firmly but decisively resisting all ecclesiastical



efforts to control or thwart the legitimate work of science and



education; in letting the light of modern research and thought



into the religious atmosphere; and in cultivating, each for



himself, obedience to "the first and great commandment, and the



second which is like unto it," as given by the Blessed Founder of



Christianity.

CHAPTER XXXIII







AS MINISTER TO RUSSIA--1892-1894







During four years after my return from service as minister to



Germany I devoted myself to the duties of the presidency at



Cornell, and on resigning that position gave all time possible to



study and travel, with reference to the book on which I was then



engaged: "A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology."







But in 1892 came a surprise. In the reminiscences of my political



life I have given an account of a visit, with Theodore Roosevelt,



Cabot Lodge, Sherman Rogers, and others, to President Harrison at



the White House, and of some very plain talk, on both sides,



relating to what we thought shortcomings of the administration in



regard to reform in the civil service. Although President



Harrison greatly impressed me at the time by the clearness and



strength of his utterances, my last expectation in the world



would have been of anything in the nature of an appointment from



him. High officials do not generally think very well of people



who comment unfavorably on their doings or give them unpleasant



advice; this I had done, to the best of my ability, in addressing



the President; and great, therefore, was my astonishment when, in



1892, he tendered me the post of minister plenipotentiary at St.



Petersburg.







On my way I stopped in London, and saw various interesting



people, but especially remember a luncheon with Lord Rothschild,



with whom I had a very interesting talk about the treatment of



the Jews in Russia. He seemed to feel deeply the persecution to



which they were subjected,--speaking with much force regarding



it, and insisting that their main crime was that they were sober,



thoughtful, and thrifty; that as to the charge that they were



preying upon the agricultural population, they preyed upon it as



do the Quakers in England--by owning agricultural machines and



letting them out; that as to the charge of usury, they were much



less exacting than many Christians; and that the main effort upon



public opinion there, such as it is, should be in the direction



of preventing the making of more severe laws. He incidentally



referred to the money power of Europe as against Russia, speaking



of Alexander II as kind and just, but of Alexander III as really



unacquainted with the great questions concerned, and under



control of the church.







I confess that I am amazed, as I revise this chapter, to learn



from apparently trustworthy sources that his bank is now making a



vast loan to Russia--to enable her to renew her old treatment of



Japan, China, Armenia, Finland, Poland, the Baltic Provinces, and



her Jewish residents. I can think of nothing so sure to



strengthen the anti-Semites throughout the world.







A few days later Sir Julian Goldschmidt came to me on the same



subject, and he impressed me much more deeply than the head of



the house of Rothschild had done. There was nothing of the



ennobled millionaire about him; he seemed to me a gentleman from



the heart outward. Presenting with much feeling the disabilities



and hardships of the Jews in Russia, he dwelt upon the



discriminations against them, especially in the matter of



military fines; their gradual and final exclusion from



professions; and the confiscation of their property at Moscow,



where they had been forced to leave the city and therefore to



realize on their whole estates at a few days' notice.







At Paris I also had some interesting conversations, regarding my



new post, with the Vicomte de Vogue, the eminent academician, who



has written so much that is interesting on Russia. Both he and



Struve, the Russian minister at Washington, who had given me a



letter to him, had married into the Annenkoff family; and I found



his knowledge of Russia, owing to this fact as well as to his



former diplomatic residence there, very suggestive. Another



interesting episode was the funeral of Renan at the College de



France, to which our minister, Mr. Coolidge, took me. Eloquent



tributes were paid, and the whole ceremony was impressive after



the French manner.







Dining with Mr. Coolidge, I found myself seated near the Duchesse



de la Rochefoucauld,--a charming American, the daughter of Mr.



Mitchell, former senator from Oregon. The duke seemed to be a



quiet, manly young officer, devoted to his duties in the army;



but it was hard to realize in him the successor of the great



duke, the friend of Washington and of Louis XVI, who showed



himself so broad-minded during our War of Independence and the



French Revolution.







At Berlin I met several of my old friends at the table of our



minister, my friend of Yale days, William Walter Phelps--among



these Virchow, Professor von Leyden, Paul Meyerheim, Carl Becker,



and Theodor Barth; and at the Russian Embassy had an interesting



talk with Count Shuvaloff, more especially on the Behring Sea



question. We agreed that the interests of the United States and



Russia in the matter were identical.







On the 4th of November I arrived in St. Petersburg after an



absence of thirty-seven years. Even in that country, where



everything moves so slowly, there had clearly been changes; the



most evident of these being the railway from the frontier. At my



former visit the journey from Berlin had required nine days and



nine nights of steady travel, mainly in a narrow post-coach; now



it was easily done in one day and two nights in very comfortable



cars. At that first visit the entire railway system of Russia,



with the exception of the road from the capital to Gatshina only



a few miles long, consisted of the line to Moscow; at this second



visit the system had spread very largely over the empire, and was



rapidly extending through Siberia and Northern China to the



Pacific.







But the deadening influence of the whole Russian system was



evident. Persons who clamor for governmental control of American



railways should visit Germany, and above all Russia, to see how



such control results. In Germany its defects are evident enough;



people are made to travel in carriages which our main lines would



not think of using, and with a lack of conveniences which with us



would provoke a revolt; but the most amazing thing about this



administration in Russia is to see how, after all this vast



expenditure, the whole atmosphere of the country seems to



paralyze energy. During my stay at St. Petersburg I traveled over



the line between that city and Berlin six or eight times, and



though there was usually but one express-train a day, I never saw



more than twenty or thirty through passengers. When one bears in



mind the fact that this road is the main artery connecting one



hundred and twenty millions of people at one end with over two



hundred millions at the other, this seems amazing; but still more



so when one considers that in. the United States, with a



population of, say, eighty millions in all, we have five great



trunk-lines across the continent, each running large



express-trains several times a day.







There was apparently little change as regards enterprise in



Russia, whatever there might be as regarded facilities for



travel. St. Petersburg had grown, of course. There were new



streets in the suburbs, and where the old admiralty wharves had



stood,--for the space of perhaps an eighth of a mile along the



Neva,--fine buildings had been erected. But these were the only



evident changes, the renowned Nevskii Prospekt remaining as



formerly--a long line of stuccoed houses on either side, almost



all poor in architecture; and the street itself the same unkempt,



shabby, commonplace thoroughfare as of old. No new bridge had



been built across the Neva for forty years. There was still but



one permanent structure spanning the river, and the great stream



of travel and traffic between the two parts of the city was



dependent mainly on the bridges of boats, which, at the breaking



of the ice in the spring, had sometimes to be withdrawn during



many days.







A change had indeed been brought by the emancipation of the



serfs, but there was little outward sign of it. The muzhik



remained, to all appearance, what he was before: in fact, as our



train drew into St. Petersburg, the peasants, with their



sheepskin caftans, cropped hair, and stupid faces, brought back



the old impressions so vividly that I seemed not to have been



absent a week. The old atmosphere of repression was evident



everywhere. I had begun my experience of it under Nicholas I, had



seen a more liberal policy under Alexander II, but now found a



recurrence of reaction, and everywhere a pressure which deadened



all efforts at initiating a better condition of things.







But I soon found one change for the better. During my former stay



under Nicholas I and Alexander II, the air was full of charges of



swindling and cheatery against the main men at court. Now next to



nothing of that sort was heard; it was evident that Alexander



III, narrow and illiberal though he might be, was an honest man,



and determined to end the sort of thing that had disgraced the



reigns of his father and grandfather.







Having made the usual visit to the Foreign Office upon my



arrival, I was accompanied three days later by the proper



officials, Prince Soltykoff and M. de Koniar, on a special train



to Gatchina, and there received by the Emperor. I found



him--though much more reserved than his father--agreeable and



straightforward. As he was averse to set speeches, we began at



once a discussion on various questions interesting the two



nations, and especially those arising out of the Behring Sea



fisheries. He seemed to enter fully into the American view;



characterizing the marauders in that sea as "ces poachers



la"--using the English word, although our conversation was in



French; and on my saying that the Russian and American interests



in that question were identical, he not only acquiesced, but



spoke at considerable length, and earnestly, in the same sense.







He alluded especially to the Chicago Exposition, spoke in praise



of its general conception and plan, said that though in certain



classes of objects of art it might not equal some of the European



expositions, it would doubtless in very many specialties surpass



all others; and on my expressing the hope that Russia would be



fully represented, he responded heartily, declaring that to be



his own wish.







Among the various subjects noted was one which was rather



curious. In the anteroom I had found the Greek Archbishop of



Warsaw arrayed in a purple robe and hat--the latter adorned with



an exceedingly lustrous cross of diamonds, and, engaging in



conversation with him, had learned that he had a few years before



visited China as a missionary; his talk was that of a very



intelligent man; and on my saying that one of our former American



bishops, Dr. Boone, in preparing a Chinese edition of the



Scriptures had found great difficulty in deciding upon a proper



equivalent for the word "God," the archbishop answered, "That is



quite natural, for the reason that the Chinese have really no



conception of such a Being."







Toward the close of my interview with the Emperor, then, I



referred to the archbishop, and congratulated the monarch on



having so accomplished and devoted a prelate in his church. At



this he said, "You speak Russian, then?" to which I answered in



the negative. "But," he said, "how then could you talk with the



archbishop?" I answered, "He spoke in French." The Emperor seemed



greatly surprised at this, and well he might be, for the



ecclesiastics in Russia seem the only exceptions to the rule that



Russians speak French and other foreign languages better and more



generally than do any other people.







This interview concluded, I was taken through a long series of



apartments filled with tapestries, porcelain, carvings,



portraits, and the like, to be received by the Empress. She was



slight in figure, graceful, with a most kindly face and manner,



and she put me at ease immediately, addressing me in English, and



detaining me much longer than I had expected. She, too, spoke of



the Chicago Exposition, saying that she had ordered some things



of her own sent to it. She also referred very pleasantly to the



Rev. Dr. Talmage of Brooklyn, who had come over on one of the



ships which brought supplies to the famine-stricken; and she



dwelt upon sundry similarities and dissimilarities between our



own country and Russia, discussing various matters of local



interest, and was in every way cordial and kindly.







The impression made by the Emperor upon me at that time was



deepened during my whole stay. He was evidently a strong



character, but within very unfortunate limits--upright, devoted



to his family, with a strong sense of his duty to his people and



of his accountability to the Almighty. But more and more it



became evident that his political and religious theories were



narrow, and that the assassination of his father had thrown him



back into the hands of reactionists. At court and elsewhere I



often found myself looking at him and expressing my thoughts



inwardly much as follows: "You are honest, true-hearted, with a



deep sense of duty; but what a world of harm you are destined to



do! With your immense physical frame and giant strength, you will



last fifty years longer; you will try by main force to hold back



the whole tide of Russian thought; and after you will come the



deluge." There was nothing to indicate the fact that he was just



at the close of his life.







At a later period I was presented to the heir to the throne, now



the Emperor Nicholas II. He seemed a kindly young man; but one of



his remarks amazed and disappointed me. During the previous year



the famine, which had become chronic in large parts of Russia,



had taken an acute form, and in its train had come typhus and



cholera. It was, in fact, the same wide-spread and deadly



combination of starvation and disease which similar causes



produced so often in Western-Europe during the middle ages. From



the United States had come large contributions of money and



grain; and as, during the year after my arrival, there had been a



recurrence of the famine, about forty thousand rubles more had



been sent me from Philadelphia for distribution. I therefore



spoke on the general subject to him, referring to the fact that



he was president of the Imperial Relief Commission. He answered



that since the crops of the last year there was no longer any



suffering; that there was no famine worthy of mention; and that



he was no longer giving attention to the subject. This was said



in an offhand, easy-going way which appalled me. The simple fact



was that the famine, though not so wide-spread, was more trying



than during the year before; for it found the peasant population



in Finland and in the central districts of the empire even less



prepared to meet it. They had, during the previous winter, very



generally eaten their draught-animals and burned everything not



absolutely necessary for their own shelter; from Finland



specimens of bread made largely of ferns had been brought me



which it would seem a shame to give to horses or cattle; and yet



his imperial highness the heir to the throne evidently knew



nothing of all this.







In explanation, I was afterward told by a person who had known



him intimately from his childhood, that, though courteous, his



main characteristic was an absolute indifference to most persons



and things about him, and that he never showed a spark of



ambition of any sort. This was confirmed by what I afterward saw



of him at court. He seemed to stand about listlessly, speaking in



a good-natured way to this or that person when it was easier than



not to do so; but, on the whole, indifferent to all which went on



about him.







After his accession to the throne, one of the best judges in



Europe, who had many opportunities to observe him closely, said



to me, "He knows nothing of his empire or of his people; he never



goes out of his house, if he can help it." This explains in some



degree the insufficiency of his programme for the Peace



Conference at The Hague and for the Japanese War, which, as I



revise these lines, is bringing fearful disaster and disgrace



upon Russia.







The representative of a foreign power in any European capital



must be presented to the principal members of the reigning



family, and so I paid my respects to the grand dukes and



duchesses. The first and most interesting of these to me was the



old Grand Duke Michael--the last surviving son of the first



Nicholas. He was generally, and doubtless rightly, regarded as,



next to his elder brother, Alexander II, the flower of the flock;



and his reputation was evidently much enhanced by comparison with



his brother next above him in age, the Grand Duke Nicholas. It



was generally charged that the conduct of the latter during the



Turkish campaign was not only unpatriotic, but inhuman. An army



officer once speaking to me regarding the suffering of his



soldiers at that time for want of shoes, I asked him where the



shoes were, and he answered: "In the pockets of the Grand Duke



Nicholas."







Michael was evidently different from his brother--not haughty and



careless toward all other created beings; but kindly, and with a



strong sense of duty. One thing touched me. I said to him that



the last time I had seen him was when he reached St. Petersburg



from the seat of the Crimean War in the spring of 1855, and drove



from the railway to the palace in company with his brother



Nicholas. Instantly the tears came into his eyes and flowed down



his cheeks. He answered: "Yes, that was sad indeed. My



father"--meaning the first Emperor Nicholas--"telegraphed us that



our mother was in very poor health, longed to see us, and



insisted on our coming to her bedside. On our way home we learned



of his death."







Of the younger generation of grand dukes,--the brothers of



Alexander III,--the greatest impression was made upon me by



Vladimir. He was apparently the strongest of all the sons of



Alexander II, being of the great Romanoff breed--big, strong,



muscular, like his brother the Emperor. He chatted pleasantly;



and I remember that he referred to Mr. James Gordon Bennett--whom



he had met on a yachting cruise--as "my friend."







Another of these big Romanoff grand dukes was Alexis, the grand



admiral. He referred to his recollections of the United States



with apparent pleasure, in spite of the wretched Catacazy



imbroglio which hindered President Grant from showing him any



hospitality at the White House, and which so vexed his father the



Emperor Alexander II.







The ladies of the imperial family were very agreeable. A remark



of one of them--a beautiful and cultivated woman, born a princess



of one of the Saxon duchies--surprised me; for, when I happened



to mention Dresden, she told me that her great desire had been to



visit that capital of her own country, but that she had never



been able to do so. She spoke of German literature, and as I



mentioned receiving a letter the day before from Professor Georg



Ebers, the historical novelist, she said: "You are happy indeed



that you can meet such people; how I should like to know Ebers!"



Such are the limitations of royalty.







Meantime, I made visits to my colleagues of the diplomatic corps,



and found them interesting and agreeable--as it is the business



of diplomatists to be. The dean was the German ambassador,



General von Schweinitz, a man ideally fit for such a position--of



wide experience, high character, and evidently strong and firm,



though kindly. When ambassador at Vienna he had married the



daughter of his colleague, the American minister, Mr. John Jay,



an old friend and colleague of mine in the American Historical



Association; and so came very pleasant relations between us. His



plain, strong sense was of use to me in more than one difficult



question.







The British ambassador was Sir Robert Morier. He, too, was a



strong character, though lacking apparently in some of General



von Schweinitz's more kindly qualities. He was big, roughish, and



at times so brusque that he might almost be called brutal. When



bullying was needed it was generally understood that he could do



it con amore. A story was told of him which, whether exact or



not, seemed to fit his character well. He had been, for a time,



minister to Portugal; and, during one of his controversies with



the Portuguese minister of foreign affairs, the latter, becoming



exasperated, said to him: "Sir, it is evident that you were not



born a Portuguese cavalier." Thereupon Morier replied: "No, thank



God, I was not: if I had been, I would have killed myself on the



breast of my mother."







And here, perhaps, is the most suitable place for mentioning a



victory which Morier enabled Great Britain to obtain over the



United States. It might be a humiliating story for me to tell,



had not the fault so evidently arisen from the shortcomings of



others. The time has come to reveal this piece of history, and I



do so in the hope that it may aid in bettering the condition in



which the Congress of the United States has, thus far, left its



diplomatic servants.







As already stated, the most important question with which I had



to deal was that which had arisen in the Behring Sea. The United



States possessed there a great and flourishing fur-seal industry,



which was managed with care and was a source of large revenue to



our government. The killing of the seals under the direction of



those who had charge of the matter was done with the utmost care



and discrimination on the Pribyloff Islands, to which these



animals resorted in great numbers during the summer. It was not



at all cruel, and was so conducted that the seal herd was fully



maintained rather than diminished. But it is among the



peculiarities of the seals that, each autumn, they migrate



southward, returning each spring in large numbers along the



Alaskan coast, and also that, while at the islands, the nursing



mothers make long excursions to fishing-banks at distances of



from one to two hundred miles. The return of these seal herds,



and these food excursions, were taken advantage of by Canadian



marauders, who slaughtered the animals, in the water, without



regard to age or sex, in a way most cruel and wasteful; so that



the seal herds were greatly diminished and in a fair way to



extermination. Our government tried to prevent this and seized



sundry marauding vessels; whereupon Great Britain felt obliged,



evidently from political motives, to take up the cause of these



Canadian poachers and to stand steadily by them. As a last



resort, the government of the United States left the matter to



arbitration, and in due time the tribunal began its sessions at



Paris. Meantime, a British commission was, in 1891-1892, ordered



to prepare the natural-history material for the British case



before the tribunal; and it would be difficult to find a more



misleading piece of work than their report. Sham scientific facts



were supplied for the purposes of the British counsel at Paris.



While I cannot believe that the authorities in London ordered or



connived at this, it is simple justice to state, as a matter of



fact, that, as afterward in the Venezuela case,[1] so in this,



British agents were guilty of the sharpest of sharp practices.



The Russian fur-seal islands having also suffered to a



considerable extent from similar marauders, a British commission



visited the Russian islands and took testimony of the Russian



commandant in a manner grossly unfair. This commandant was an



honest man, with good powers of observation and with considerable



insight into the superficial facts of seal life, but without



adequate scientific training; his knowledge of English was very



imperfect, and the commission apparently led him to say and sign



just what they wanted. He was somehow made to say just the things



which were needed to help the British case, and not to say



anything which could hurt it. So absurd were the misstatements to



which he had thus been led to attach his name that the Russian



Government ordered him to come all the way from the Russian



islands on the coast of Siberia to St. Petersburg, there to be



reexamined. It was an enormous journey--from the islands to



Japan, from Japan to San Francisco, from San Francisco to New



York, and thence to St. Petersburg. There, with the aid of a



Russian expert, I had the satisfaction of putting questions to



him; and, having found the larger part of his previous alleged



testimony to be completely in conflict with his knowledge and



opinions, I forwarded this new testimony to those in charge of



the American case before the Paris tribunal, in the hope that it



would place the whole matter in its true light. With it was also



presented the concurring testimony taken by the American experts



who had been sent to the Behring Sea. Those experts were Drs.



Mendenhall and Merriam, scientists of the highest character, and



their reports were, in every essential particular, afterward



confirmed by another man of science, after study of the whole



question in the islands and on the adjacent seas--Dr. Jordan,



president of Stanford University, probably the highest authority



in the United States--and, perhaps, in the world--regarding the



questions at issue: a pupil and friend of Agassiz, a man utterly



incapable of making a statement regarding any point in science



which he did not fully believe, no matter what its political



bearing might be.











[1] See my chapter on the Venezuela Commission for the trick



attempted by British agents in the first British Blue Book on



that subject.











And now to another feature of the case. Before leaving Washington



for St. Petersburg, I had consulted with the Secretary of State



and the leading persons in charge of our case, and on my way had



talked with Count Shuvaloff, the Russian ambassador at Berlin;



and all agreed that the interests of the United States and Russia



in the matter of protecting the seals were identical. The only



wonder was that, this fact being so clear, the Russian Foreign



Office constantly held back from showing any active sympathy with



the United States in our efforts to right this wrong done to both



nations.







At my first presentation to the Emperor I found him, as already



stated, of the same opinion as the Washington cabinet and Count



Shuvaloff. He was thoroughly with us, was bitter against the



Canadian marauders, agreed in the most straightforward and



earnest manner that the interests of Russia and the United States



in this question were identical, and referred severely to the



British encroachments upon both the nations in the northern



seas.[2]











[2] See detailed account of this conversation previously given in



this chapter.











All went smoothly until I took up the subject at the Russian



Foreign Office. There I found difficulties, though at first I did



not fully understand them. The Emperor Alexander III was dying at



Livadia in the Crimea; M. de Giers, the minister of foreign



affairs, a man of high character, was dying at Tzarskoye Selo;



and in charge of his department was an under-secretary who had



formerly, for a short time, represented Russia at Washington and



had not been especially successful there. Associated with him was



another under-secretary, who was in charge of the Asiatic



division at the Russian Foreign Office. My case was strong, and I



was quite willing to meet Sir Robert Morier in any fair argument



regarding it. I had taken his measure on one or two occasions



when he had discussed various questions in my presence; and had



not the slightest fear that, in a fair presentation of the



matter, he could carry his point against me. At various times we



met pleasantly enough in the anterooms of the Foreign Office; but



at that period our representative at the Russian court was simply



a minister plenipotentiary and the British representative an



ambassador, and as such he, of course, had precedence over me,



with some adventitious advantages which I saw then, and others



which I realized afterward. It was not long before it became



clear that Sir Robert Morier had enormous "influence" with the



above-named persons in charge of the Foreign Office, and, indeed,



with Russian officials in general. They seemed not only to stand



in awe of him, but to look toward him as "the eyes of a maiden to



the hand of her mistress." I now began to understand the fact



which had so long puzzled our State Department--namely, that



Russia did not make common cause with us, though we were fighting



her battles at the same time with our own. But I struggled on,



seeing the officials frequently and doing the best that was



possible.







Meantime, the arbitration tribunal was holding its sessions at



Paris, and the American counsel were doing their best to secure



justice for our country. The facts were on our side, and there



seemed every reason to hope for a decision in our favor. A vital



question was as to how extensive the closed zone for the seals



about our islands should be. The United States showed that the



nursing seals were killed by the Canadian poachers at a distance



of from one to two hundred miles from the islands, and that



killing ought not to be allowed within a zone of that radius;



but, on the other hand, the effort of the British counsel was to



make this zone as small as possible. They had even contended for



a zone of only ten miles radius. But just at the nick of time Sir



Robert Morier intervened at St. Petersburg. No one but himself



and the temporary authorities of the Russian Foreign Office had,



or could have had, any knowledge of his manoeuver. By the means



which his government gave him power to exercise, he in some way



secured privately, from the underlings above referred to as in



temporary charge of the Foreign Office, an agreement with Great



Britain which practically recognized a closed zone of only thirty



miles radius about the Russian islands. This fact was telegraphed



just at the proper moment to the British representatives before



the tribunal; and, as one of the judges afterward told me, it



came into the case like a bomb. It came so late that any adequate



explanation of Russia's course was impossible, and its



introduction at that time was strenuously objected to by our



counsel; but the British lawyers thus got the fact fully before



the tribunal, and the tribunal naturally felt that in granting us



a sixty-mile radius--double that which Russia had asked of Great



Britain for a similar purpose--it was making a generous



provision. The conditions were practically the same at the



American and Russian seal islands; yet the Russian officials in



charge of the matter seemed entirely regardless of this fact,



and, indeed, of Russian interests. After secret negotiation with



Sir Robert, without the slightest hint to the American minister



of their intended sacrifice of their "identical interest with the



United States," they allowed this treachery to be sprung upon us.



The sixty-mile limit was established by the tribunal, and it has



proved utterly delusive. The result of this decision of the



tribunal was that this great industry of ours was undermined, if



not utterly destroyed; and that the United States were also



mulcted to the amount of several hundred thousand dollars,



besides the very great expense attending the presentation of her



case to the tribunal.







I now come back to the main point which has caused me to bring up



this matter in these reminiscences. How was it that Great Britain



obtained this victory? To what was it due? The answer is simple:



it was due to the fact that the whole matter at St. Petersburg



was sure to be decided, not by argument, but by "influence." Sir



Robert Morier had what in the Tammany vernacular is called a



"pull." His government had given him, as its representative, all



the means necessary to have his way in this and all other



questions like it; whereas the American Government had never



given its representative any such means or opportunities. The



British representative was an AMBASSADOR, and had a spacious,



suitable, and well-furnished house in which he could entertain



fitly and largely, and to which the highest Russian officials



thought it an honor to be invited. The American representatives



were simply MINISTERS; from time immemorial had never had such a



house; had generally no adequate place for entertaining; had to



live in apartments such as they might happen to find vacant in



various parts of the town--sometimes in very poor quarters,



sometimes in better; were obliged to furnish them at their own



expense; had, therefore, never been able to obtain a tithe of



that social influence, so powerful in Russia, which was exercised



by the British Embassy.







More than this, the British ambassador had adequate means



furnished him for exercising political influence. The American



representatives had not; they had been stinted in every way. The



British ambassador had a large staff of thoroughly trained



secretaries and attaches, the very best of their kind,--well



educated to begin with, thoroughly trained afterward,--serving as



antennae for Great Britain in Russian society; and as the first



secretary of his embassy he had no less a personage than Henry



Howard, now Sir Henry Howard, minister at The Hague, one of the



brightest, best-trained, and most experienced diplomatists in



Europe. The American representative was at that time provided



with only one secretary of legation, and he, though engaging and



brilliant, a casual appointment who remained in the country only



a few months. I had, indeed, secured a handsome and comfortable



apartment, and entertained at dinner and otherwise the leading



members of the Russian ministry and of the diplomatic corps, at a



cost of more than double my salary; but the influence thus



exercised was, of course, as nothing compared to that exercised



by a diplomatist like Sir Robert Morier, who had every sort of



resource at his command, who had been for perhaps forty years



steadily in the service of his country, and had learned by long



experience to know the men with whom he had to deal and the ways



of getting at them. His power in St. Petersburg was felt in a



multitude of ways: all officials at the Russian Foreign Office,



from the highest to the lowest, naturally desired to be on good



terms with him. They knew that his influence had become very



great and that it was best to have his friendship; they loved



especially to be invited to his dinners, and their families loved



to be invited to his balls. He was a POWER. The question above



referred to, of such importance to the United States, was not



decided by argument, but simply by the weight of social and other



influence, which counts so enormously in matters of this kind at



all European capitals, and especially in Russia. This condition



of things has since been modified by the change of the legation



into an embassy; but, as no house has been provided, the old



difficulty remains. The United States has not the least chance of



success, and under her present shabby system never will have, in



closely contested cases, with any of the great powers of the



earth. They provide fitly for their representatives; the United



States does not. The representatives of other powers, being thus



provided for, are glad to remain at their posts and to devote



themselves to getting a thorough mastery of everything connected



with diplomatic business; American representatives, obliged, as a



rule, to take up with uncomfortable quarters, finding their



position not what it ought to be as compared with that of the



representatives of other great powers, and obliged to expend much



more than their salaries, are generally glad to resign after a



brief term. Especially has this been the case in St. Petersburg.



The terms of our representatives there have generally been very



short. A few have stayed three or four years, but most have



stayed much shorter terms. In one case a representative of the



United States remained only three or four months, and in another



only six weeks. So marked was this tendency that the Emperor once



referred to it in a conversation with one of our representatives,



saying that he hoped that this American diplomatist would remain



longer than his predecessors had generally done.







The action of the Russian authorities in the Behring Sea



question, which is directly traceable to the superior policy of



Great Britain in maintaining a preponderating diplomatic,



political, and social influence at the Russian capital, cost our



government a sum which would have bought suitable houses in



several capitals, and would have given to each American



representative a proper staff of assistants. I have presented



this matter with reluctance, though I feel not the slightest



responsibility for my part in it. I do not think that any



right-minded man can blame me for it, any more than, in the



recent South African War, he could have blamed Lord Roberts, the



British general, if the latter had been sent to the Transvaal



with insufficient means, inadequate equipment, and an army far



inferior in numbers to that of his enemy.







I am not at all in this matter "a man with a grievance"; for I



knew what American representatives had to expect, and was not



disappointed. My feeling is simply that of an American citizen



whose official life is past, and who can look back



dispassionately and tell the truth plainly.







This case is presented simply in the hope that it will do



something to arouse thinking men in public life, and especially



in the Congress of the United States, to provide at least a



suitable house or apartment for the American representative in



each of the more important capitals of the world, as all other



great powers and many of the lesser nations have done. If I can



aid in bringing about this result, I care nothing for any



personal criticism which may be brought upon me.















CHAPTER XXXIV







INTERCOURSE WITH RUSSIAN STATESMEN--1892-1894







To return to Sir Robert Morier. There had been some friction



between his family and that of one of my predecessors, and this



had for some time almost ended social intercourse between his



embassy and our legation; but on my arrival I ignored this, and



we established very satisfactory personal relations. He had held



important positions in various parts of Europe, and had been



closely associated with many of the most distinguished men of his



own and other countries. Reading Grant Duff's "Memoirs," I find



that Morier's bosom friend, of all men in the world, was Jowett,



the late head of Oriel College at Oxford. But Sir Robert was at



the close of his career; his triumph in the Behring Sea matter



was his last. I met him shortly afterward at his last visit to



the Winter Palace: with great effort he mounted the staircase,



took his position at the head of the diplomatic circle, and,



immediately after his conversation with the Emperor, excused



himself and went home. This was the last time I ever saw him; he



returned soon afterward to England and died. His successor, Sir



Frank Lascelles, more recently my colleague at Berlin, is a very



different character. His manner is winning, his experience large



and interesting, his first post having been at Paris during the



Commune, and his latest at Teheran. Our relations became, and



have ever since remained, all that I could desire. He, too, in



every post, is provided with all that is necessary for



accomplishing the purposes of Great Britain, and will doubtless



win great success for his country, though not in exactly the same



way as his predecessor.







The French ambassador was the Comte de Montebello, evidently a



man of ability, but with perhaps less of the engaging qualities



than one generally expects in a French diplomatic representative.



The Turkish ambassador, Husny Pasha, like most Turkish



representatives whom I have met, had learned to make himself very



agreeable; but his position was rather trying: he had fought in



the Russo-Turkish War and had seen his country saved from the



most abject humiliation, if not destruction, only at the last



moment, by the Berlin Conference. His main vexation in St.



Petersburg arose from the religious feeling of the Emperor. Every



great official ceremony in Russia is prefaced, as a rule, by a



church service; hence Husny was excluded, since he felt bound to



wear the fez, and this the Emperor would not tolerate; though



there was really no more harm in his wearing this simple



head-gear in church than in a woman wearing her bonnet or a



soldier wearing his helmet.







Interesting, too, was the Italian ambassador, Marochetti, son of



the eminent sculptor, some of whose artistic ability he had



inherited. He was fond of exercising this talent; but it was



generally understood that his recall was finally due to the fact



that his diplomatic work had suffered in consequence.







The Austrian ambassador, Count Wolkenstein, was, in many things,



the most trustworthy of counselors; more than once, under trying



circumstances, I found his advice precious; for he knew,



apparently, in every court of Europe, the right man to approach,



and the right way to approach him, on every conceivable subject.







Of the ministers plenipotentiary the Dutch representative, Van



Stoetwegen, was the best counselor I found. He was shrewd, keen,



and kindly; but his tongue was sharp--so much so that it finally



brought about his recall. He made a remark one day which



especially impressed me. I had said to him, "I have just sent a



despatch to my government declaring my skepticism as to the



probability of any war in Europe for a considerable time to come.



When I arrived in Berlin eleven years ago all the knowing people



said that a general European war must break out within a few



months: in the spring they said it must come in the autumn; and



in the autumn they said it must come in the spring. All these



years have passed and there is still no sign of war. We hear the



same prophecies daily, but I learned long since not to believe in



them. War may come, but it seems to me more and more unlikely."



He answered, "I think you are right. I advise my own government



in the same sense. The fact is that war in these days is not what



it once was; it is infinitely more dangerous from every point of



view, and it becomes more and more so every day. Formerly a



crowned head, when he thought himself aggrieved, or felt that he



would enjoy a campaign, plunged into war gaily. If he succeeded,



all was well; if not, he hauled off to repair damages,--very much



as a pugilist would do after receiving a black eye in a fist



fight,--and in a short time the losses were repaired and all went



on as before. In these days the case is different: it is no



longer a simple contest in the open, with the possibility of a



black eye or, at most, of a severe bruise; it has become a matter



of life and death to whole nations. Instead of being like a fist



fight, it is like a combat between a lot of champions armed with



poisoned daggers, and in a dark room; if once the struggle



begins, no one knows how many will be drawn into it or who will



be alive at the end of it; the probabilities are that all will be



injured terribly and several fatally. War in these days means the



cropping up of a multitude of questions dangerous not only to



statesmen but to monarchs, and even to society itself. Monarchs



and statesmen know this well; and, no matter how truculent they



may at times appear, they really dread war above all things."







One of my colleagues at St. Petersburg was interesting in a very



different way from any of the others. This was Pasitch, the



Servian minister. He was a man of fine presence and, judging from



his conversation, of acute mind. He had some years before been



sentenced to death for treason, but since that had been prime



minister. Later he was again put on trial for his life at



Belgrade, charged with being a partner in the conspiracy which



resulted in the second attempt against the life of King Milan.



His speech before his judges, recently published, was an effort



worthy of a statesman, and carried the conviction to my mind that



he was not guilty.[3]











[3] He was found guilty, but escaped death by a bitter



humiliation: it was left for others to bring about Milan's



assassination.











The representatives of the extreme Orient were both interesting



personages, but the same difference prevailed there as elsewhere:



the Chinese was a mandarin, able to speak only through an



interpreter; the Japanese was trained in Western science, and



able to speak fluently both Russian and French. His successor,



whom I met at the Peace Conference of The Hague, spoke English



admirably.







Among the secretaries and attaches, several were very



interesting; and of these was the first British secretary Henry



Howard, now Sir Henry Howard, minister at The Hague. He and his



American wife were among the most delightful of associates.



Another in this category was the Bavarian secretary, Baron



Guttenberg, whom I often met later at Berlin. When I spoke to him



about a visit I had made to Wurzburg, and the desecration of the



magnificent old Romanesque cathedral there by plastering its



whole interior over with nude angels, and substituting for the



splendid old mediaeval carving Louis Quinze woodwork in white and



gold, he said: "Yes; you are right; and it was a bishop of my



family who did it."







As to Russian statesmen, I had the benefit of the fairly friendly



spirit which has usually been shown toward the American



representative in Russia by all in authority from the Emperor



down. I do not mean by this that the contentions of the American



Embassy are always met by speedy concessions, for among the most



trying of all things in diplomatic dealings with that country are



the long delays in all business; but a spirit is shown which, in



the long run, serves the purpose of our representative as regards



most questions.







It seems necessary here to give a special warning against putting



any trust in the epigram which has long done duty as a piece of



politico-ethnological wisdom: "Scratch a Russian and you will



find a Tartar." It would be quite as correct to say, "Scratch an



American and you will find an Indian." The simple fact is that



the Russian officials with whom foreigners have to do are men of



experience, and, as a rule, much like those whom one finds in



similar positions in other parts of Europe. A foreign



representative has to meet on business, not merely the Russian



minister of foreign affairs and the heads of departments in the



Foreign Office, but various other members of the imperial



cabinet, especially the ministers of finance, of war, of the



navy, of the interior, of justice, as well as the chief municipal



authorities of St. Petersburg; and I can say that many of these



gentlemen, both as men and as officials, are the peers of men in



similar positions in most other countries which I have known.



Though they were at times tenacious in questions between their



own people and ours, and though they held political doctrines



very different from those we cherish, I am bound to say that most



of them did so in a way which disarmed criticism. At the same



time I must confess a conviction which has more and more grown



upon me, that the popular view regarding the power, vigor, and



foresight of Russian statesmen is ill-founded. And it must be



added that Russian officials and their families are very



susceptible to social influences: a foreign representative who



entertains them frequently and well can secure far more for his



country than one who trusts to argument alone. In no part of the



world will a diplomatist more surely realize the truth embedded



in Oxenstiern's famous utterance, "Go forth, my son, and see with



how little wisdom the world is governed." When one sees what



really strong men might do in Russia, what vast possibilities



there are which year after year are utterly neglected, one cannot



but think that the popular impression regarding the superiority



of Russian statesmen is badly based. As a matter of fact, there



has not been a statesman of the first class, of Russian birth,



since Catherine the Great, and none of the second class unless



Nesselrode and the Emperor Nicholas are to be excepted. To



consider Prince Gortchakoff a great chancellor on account of his



elaborate despatches is absurd. The noted epigram regarding him



is doubtless just: "C'est un Narcisse qui se mire dans son



encrier."







To call him a great statesman in the time of Cavour Bismarck,



Lincoln, and Seward is preposterous. Whatever growth in



civilization Russia has made in the last forty years has been



mainly in spite of the men who have posed as her statesmen; the



atmosphere of Russian autocracy is fatal to greatness in any



form.







The emancipation of the serfs was due to a policy advocated by



the first Nicholas and carried out under Alexander II; but it was



made possible mainly by Miloutine, Samarine, Tcherkassky, and



other subordinates, who never were allowed to approach the first



rank as state servants. This is my own judgment, founded on



observation and reading during half a century, and it is the



quiet judgment of many who have had occasion to observe Russia



longer and more carefully.







Next, as to the Foreign Office. Nearly a hundred years ago



Napoleon compared Alexander I and those about him to "Greeks of



the Lower Empire." That saying was repelled as a slander; but,



ever since it was uttered, the Russian Foreign Office seems to



have been laboring to deserve it. There are chancelleries in the



world which, when they give promises, are believed and trusted.



Who, in the light of the last fifty years, would claim that the



Russian Foreign Office is among these? Its main reputation is for



astuteness finally brought to naught; it has constantly been "too



clever by half."







Take the loudly trumpeted peace proposals to the world made by



Nicholas II. When the nations got together at The Hague to carry



out the Czar's supposed purpose, it was found that all was



haphazard; that no adequate studies had been made, no project



prepared; in fact, that the Emperor's government had virtually



done nothing showing any real intention to set a proper example.



Nothing but the high character and abilities of M. de Martens and



one or two of his associates saved the prestige of the Russian



Foreign Office at that time. Had there been a man of real power



in the chancellorship or in the ministry of foreign affairs, he



would certainly have advised the Emperor to dismiss to useful



employments, say, two hundred to two hundred and fifty thousand



troops, which he could have done without the slightest



danger--thus showing that he was in earnest, crippling the war



clique, and making the beginning of a great reform which all



Europe would certainly have been glad to follow. But there was



neither the wisdom nor the strength required to advise and carry



through such a measure. Deference to the "military party" and



petty fear of a loss of military prestige were all-controlling.







Take the army and the navy departments. In these, if anywhere,



Russia has been thought strong. The main occupation of leading



Russians for a hundred years has been, not the steady uplifting



of the people in intellect and morals, not the vigorous



development of natural resources, but preparations for war on



land and sea. This has been virtually the one business of the



main men of light and leading from the emperors and grand dukes



down. Drill and parade have been apparently everything: the



strengthening of the empire by the education of the people, and



the building of industrial prosperity as a basis for a great army



and navy, seem to have been virtually nothing. The results are



now before the world for the third time since 1815.







An objector may remind me of the emancipation of the serfs. I do



not deny the greatness and nobleness of Alexander II and the



services of the men he then called to his aid; but I lived in



Russia both before and since that reform, and feel obliged to



testify that, thus far, its main purpose has been so thwarted by



reactionaries that there is, as yet, little, if any, practical



difference between the condition of the Russian peasant before



and since obtaining his freedom.







Take the dealings with Finland. The whole thing is monstrous. It



is both comedy and tragedy. Finland is by far the best-developed



part of the empire; it stands on a higher plane than do the other



provinces as regards every element of civilization; it has



steadily been the most loyal of all the realms of the Czar.



Nihilism and anarchism have never gained the slightest foothold;



yet to-day there is nobody in the whole empire strong enough to



prevent sundry bigots--military and ecclesiastical--leading the



Emperor to violate his coronation oath; to make the simple



presentation of a petition to him treasonable; to trample Finland



under his feet; to wrong grievously and insult grossly its whole



people; to banish and confiscate the property of its best men; to



muzzle its press; to gag its legislators; and thus to lower the



whole country to the level of the remainder of Russia.







During my stay in Russia at the time of the Crimean War, I had



been interested in the Finnish peasants whom I saw serving on the



gunboats. There was a sturdiness, heartiness, and loyalty about



them which could not fail to elicit good-will; but during this



second stay in Russia my sympathies with them were more



especially enlisted. During the hot weather of the first summer



my family were at the Finnish capital, Helsingfors, at the point



where the Gulf of Finland opens into the Baltic. The whole people



deeply interested me. Here was one of the most important



universities of Europe, a noble public library, beautiful



buildings, and throughout the whole town an atmosphere of



cleanliness and civilization far superior to that which one finds



in any Russian city. Having been added to Russia by Alexander I



under his most solemn pledges that it should retain its own



constitutional government, it had done so up to the time of my



stay; and the results were evident throughout the entire grand



duchy. While in Russia there had been from time immemorial a



debased currency, the currency of Finland was as good as gold;



while in Russia all public matters bore the marks of arbitrary



repression, in Finland one could see the results of enlightened



discussion; while in Russia the peasant is but little, if any,



above Asiatic barbarism, the Finnish peasant--simple, genuine--is



clearly far better developed both morally and religiously. It is



a grief to me in these latter days to see that the measures which



were then feared have since been taken. There seems a



determination to grind down Finland to a level with Russia in



general. We heard, not long since, much sympathy expressed for



the Boers in South Africa in their struggle against England; but



infinitely more pathetic is the case of Finland. The little grand



duchy has done what it could to save itself, but it recognizes



the fact that its two millions of people are utterly powerless



against the brute force of the one hundred and twenty millions of



the Russian Empire. The struggle in South Africa meant, after



all, that if worst came to worst, the Boers would, within a



generation or two, enjoy a higher type of constitutional liberty



than they ever could have developed under any republic they could



have established; but Finland is now forced to give up her



constitutional government and to come under the rule of brutal



Russian satraps. These have already begun their work. All is to



be "Russified": the constitutional bodies are to be virtually



abolished; the university is to be brought down to the level of



Dorpat--once so noted as a German university, now so worthless as



a Russian university; for the simple Protestantism of the people



is to be substituted the fetishism of the Russo-Greek Church. It



is the saddest spectacle of our time. Previous emperors, however



much they wished to do so, did not dare break their oaths to



Finland; but the present weakling sovereign, in his indifference,



carelessness, and absolute unfitness to rule, has allowed the



dominant reactionary clique about him to accomplish its own good



pleasure. I put on record here the prophecy that his dynasty, if



not himself, will be punished for it. All history shows that no



such crime has gone unpunished. It is a far greater crime than



the partition of Poland; for Poland had brought her fate on



herself, while Finland has been the most loyal part of the



empire. Not even Moscow herself has been more thoroughly devoted



to Russia and the reigning dynasty. The young monarch whose



weakness has led to this fearful result will bring retribution



upon himself and those who follow him. The Romanoffs will yet



find that "there is a Power in the universe, not ourselves, which



makes for righteousness." The house of Hapsburg and its



satellites found this in the humiliating end of their reign in



Italy; the house of Valois found it, after the massacre of St.



Bartholomew, in their own destruction; the Bourbons found it,



after the driving out of the Huguenots and the useless wars of



Louis XIV and XV, in the French Revolution which ended their



dynasty. Both the Napoleons met their punishment after violating



the rights of human nature. The people of the United States,



after the Fugitive Slave Law, found their punishment in the Civil



War, which cost nearly a million of lives and, when all is



reckoned, ten thousand millions of treasure.







When I talked with this youth before he came to the throne, and



saw how little he knew of his own empire,--how absolutely unaware



he was that the famine was continuing for a second year in



various important districts, there resounded in my ears, as so



often at other times, the famous words of Oxenstiern to his son,



"Go forth, my son, and see with how little wisdom the world is



governed."







Pity to say it, the European sovereign to whom Nicholas II can be



most fully compared is Charles IX of France, under the influence



of his family and men and women courtiers and priests,



authorizing the massacre of St. Bartholomew. The punishment to be



meted out to him and his house is sure.[4]











[4] The above was written before the Russian war with Japan and



the assassinations of Bobrikoff, Plehve, and others were dreamed



of. My prophecy seems likely to be realized far earlier than I



had thought possible.















As I revise these lines, we see another exhibition of the same



weakness and folly. The question between Russia and Japan could



have been easily and satisfactorily settled in a morning talk by



any two business men of average ability; but the dominant clique



has forced on one of the most terrible wars in history, which



bids fair to result in the greatest humiliation Russia has ever



known.







The same thing may be said regarding Russia's dealings with the



Baltic provinces. The "Russification" which has been going on



there for some years is equally absurd, equally wicked, and sure



to be equally disastrous.







The first Russian statesman with whom I had to do was the



minister of foreign affairs, M. de Giers; but he was dying. I saw



him twice in retirement at Tzarskoye Selo, and came to respect



him much. He spoke at length regarding the entente between Russia



and France, and insisted that it was not in the interest of war



but of peace. "Tell your government," he said, "that the closer



the lines are drawn which bind Russia and France, the more



strongly will Russian influence be used to hold back the French



from war."







At another time he discoursed on the folly of war, and especially



regarding the recent conflict between Russia and Turkey. He spoke



of its wretched results, of the ingratitude which Russia had



experienced from the peoples she had saved from the Turks, and



finally, with extreme bitterness, of the vast sums of money



wasted in it which could have been used in raising the condition



of the Russian peasantry. He spoke with the conviction of a dying



man, and I felt that he was sincere. At the same time I felt it a



pity that under the Russian system there is no chance for such a



man really to enforce his ideas. For one day he may be in the



ascendancy with the autocrat; and the next, through the influence



of grand dukes, women, priests, or courtiers, the very opposite



ideas may become dominant.







The men with whom I had more directly to do at the Foreign Office



were the acting minister, Shishkin, who had formerly been at



Washington, and the head of the Asiatic department, Count



Kapnist. They were agreeable in manner; but it soon became clear



that, regarding the question of the Behring seal-fisheries, they



were pursuing a policy of their own, totally distinct from the



interests of the empire. Peter the Great would have beheaded both



of them.







The strongest man among the Czar's immediate advisers was



understood to be the finance minister, De Witte. There always



seemed in him a certain sullen force. The story usually told of



his rise in the world is curious. It is, in effect, that when the



Emperor Alexander II and his family were wrecked in their special



train at Borki, many of their attendants were killed; and the



world generally, including the immediate survivors of the



catastrophe, believed for some time that it was the result of a



nihilist plot. There was, therefore, a general sweeping into



prison of subordinat'e railway officials; and among these was De



Witte, then in charge of a railway station. During the



examinations which ensued he showed himself so clear-headed and



straightforward that he attracted attention was promoted, put



into the finance ministry, and finally advanced to the first



place in it. His dealings with Russian finances have since shown



great capacity: he has brought the empire out of the slough of



depreciated currency and placed it firmly on a gold basis. I came



especially to know him when he offered, through me, to the United



States a loan of gold to enable us to tide over our difficulties



with the currency question. He informed me that Russia had in her



treasury many millions of rubles in American gold eagles, and



that the Russian gold reserve then in the treasury was about six



hundred millions of rubles.







The only result was that I was instructed to convey the thanks of



the President to him, there being no law enabling us to take



advantage of his offer. What he wished to do was to make a call



loan, whereas our Washington Government could obtain gold only by



issuing bonds.







I also met him in a very interesting way when I presented to him



Rabbi Krauskopf of Philadelphia, who discussed the question of



allowing sundry Israelites who were crowded into the western



districts of the empire to be transferred to some of the less



congested districts, on condition that funds for that purpose be



furnished from their coreligionists in America. De Witte's



discussion of the whole subject was liberal and statesmanlike.



Unfortunately, there was, as I believe, a fundamental error in



his general theory, which is the old Russian idea at the bottom



of the autocracy--namely, that the State should own everything.



More and more he went on extending government ownership to the



railways, until the whole direction and management of them



virtually centered in his office.







On this point he differed widely from his predecessor in the



finance ministry, Wischniegradsky. I had met the latter years



before, at the Paris Exposition, when he was at the head of the



great technical school in Moscow, and found him instructive and



interesting. Now I met him after his retirement from the finance



ministry. Calling on him one day, I said: "You will probably



build your trans-Siberian railway at a much less cost than we



were able to build our first trans-continental railway; you will



do it directly, by government funds, and so will probably not



have to make so many rich men as we did." His answer impressed me



strongly. He said: "As to a government building a railway more



cheaply than private individuals, I decidedly doubt; but I would



favor private individuals building it, even if the cost were



greater. I like to see rich men made; they are what Russia most



needs at this moment. What can capitalists do with their money?



They can't eat it or drink it: they have to invest it in other



enterprises; and such enterprises, to be remunerative, must meet



the needs of the people. Capitalists are far more likely to



invest their money in useful enterprises, and to manage these



investments well, than any finance minister can be, no matter how



gifted."







That he was right the history of Russia is showing more and more



every day. To return to M. de Witte, it seemed strange to most



onlookers that the present Emperor threw him out of the finance



ministry, in which he had so greatly distinguished himself, and



shelved him in one of those bodies, such as the council of state



or the senate, which exist mainly as harbors or shelters for



dismissed functionaries. But really there was nothing singular



about it. As regards the main body at court, from the grand



dukes, the women, etc., down, he had committed the sin of which



Turgot and Necker were guilty when they sought to save France but



found that the women, princes, and favorites of poor Louis XVI's



family were determined to dip their hands into the state



treasury, and were too strong to be controlled. Ruin followed the



dismissal of Turgot and Necker then, and seems to be following



the dismissal of De Witte now: though as I revise this chapter



word comes that the Emperor has recalled him.







No doubt Prince Khilkoff, who has come in as minister of internal



communications since my departure from Russia, is also a strong



man; but no functionary can take the place of a great body of



individuals who invest their own money in public works throughout



an entire nation.







There was also another statesman in a very different field whom I



found exceedingly interesting,--a statesman who had gained a



power in the empire second to no other save the Emperor himself,



and had centered in himself more hatred than any other Russian of



recent times,--the former Emperor's tutor and virtual minister as



regards ecclesiastical affairs, Pobedonostzeff. His theories are



the most reactionary of all developed in modern times; and his



hand was then felt, and is still felt, in every part of the



empire, enforcing those theories. Whatever may be thought of his



wisdom, his patriotism is not to be doubted. Though I differ from



him almost totally, few men have so greatly interested me, and



one of the following chapters will be devoted to him.







But there were some other so-called statesmen toward whom I had a



very different feeling. One of these was the minister of the



interior. Nothing could be more delusive than his manner. He



always seemed about to accede to the ideas of his interlocutor,



but he had one fundamental idea of his own, and only one; and



that was, evidently, never to do anything which he could possibly



avoid. He always seemed to me a sort of great jellyfish, looking



as if he had a mission to accomplish, but, on closer examination,



proving to be without consistency, and slippery. His theory



apparently was, "No act, no responsibility"; and throughout the



Russian Empire this principle of action, or, rather, of inaction,



appears to be very widely diffused.







I had one experience with this functionary, who, I am happy to



say, has since been relieved of his position and shelved among



the do-nothings of the Russian senate, which showed me what he



was. Two American ladies of the best breeding and culture, and



bearing the most satisfactory letters of introduction, had been



staying in St. Petersburg, and had met, at my table and



elsewhere, some of the most interesting people in Russian



society. From St. Petersburg they had gone to Moscow; and, after



a pleasant stay there, had left for Vienna by way of Warsaw.



Returning home late at night, about a week afterward, I found an



agonizing telegram from them, stating that they had been stopped



at the Austrian frontier and sent back fifty miles to a dirty



little Russian village; that their baggage had all gone on to



Vienna; that, there being no banker in the little hamlet where



they were, their letter of credit was good for nothing; that all



this was due to the want of the most trivial of formalities in a



passport; that they had obtained all the vises supposed to be



needed at St. Petersburg and at Moscow; and that, though the



American consul at Warsaw had declared these to be sufficient to



take them out of the empire, they had been stopped by a petty



Russian official because they had no vise from the Warsaw police.







Early next morning I went to the minister of the interior,



presented the case to him, told him all about these



ladies,--their high standing, the letters they had brought, the



people they had met,--assured him that nothing could be further



from possibility than the slightest tendency on their part toward



any interference with the Russian Government, and asked him to



send a telegram authorizing their departure. He was most profuse



in his declarations of his willingness to help. Nothing in the



world, apparently, would give him more pleasure; and, though



there was a kind of atmosphere enveloping his talk which I did



not quite like, I believed that the proper order would be given.



But precious time went on, and again came telegrams from the



ladies that nothing was done. Again I went to the minister to



urge the matter upon his attention; again he assumed the same



jellyfish condition, pleasing but evasive. Then I realized the



situation; went at once to the prefect of St. Petersburg, General



von Wahl, although it was not strictly within his domain; and he,



a man of character and vigor, took the necessary measures and the



ladies were released.







Like so many other persons whom I have known who came into Russia



and were delighted with it during their whole stay, these ladies



returned to America most bitter haters of the empire and of



everything within it.







As to Von Wahl, who seemed to me one of the very best Russian



officials I met, he has since met reward for his qualities: from



the Czar a transfer to a provincial governorship, and from the



anarchists a bullet which, though intended to kill him, only



wounded him.







Many were the sufferers from this feature in Russian



administration--this shirking of labor and responsibility. Among



these was a gentleman belonging to one of the most honored



Russian families, who was greatly devoted to fruit-culture, and



sought to bring the products of his large estates in the south of



Russia into Moscow and St. Petersburg. He told me that he had



tried again and again, but the officials shrugged their shoulders



and would not take the trouble; that finally he had induced them



to give him a freight-car and to bring a load of fruit to St.



Petersburg as soon as possible; but, though the journey ought to



have taken only three or four days, it actually took several



weeks; and, of course, all the fruit was spoiled. As I told him



of the fruit-trains which bring the products of California across



our continent and distribute them to the Atlantic ports, even



enabling them to be found fresh in the markets of London, he



almost shed tears. This was another result of state control of



railways. As a matter of fact, there is far more and better fruit



to be seen on the tables of artisans in most American towns,



however small, than in the lordliest houses of Moscow and St.



Petersburg; and this solely because in our country energetic men



conduct transportation with some little ambition to win public



approval and patronage, while in Russia a horde of state



officials shirk labor and care as much as possible.







Still another sufferer was a very energetic man who had held



sundry high positions, but was evidently much discouraged. He



showed me specimens of various rich ores from different parts of



the empire, but lamented that there was no one to take hold of



the work of bringing out these riches. It was perfectly clear



that with the minister of the interior at that time, as in sundry



other departments, the great question was "how not to do it."



Evidently this minister and functionaries like him felt that if



great enterprises and industries were encouraged, they would



become so large as to be difficult to manage; hence, that it



would be more comfortable to keep things within as moderate



compass as possible.







To this easy-going view of public duty there were a few notable



exceptions. While De Witte was the most eminent of these, there



was one who has since become sadly renowned, and who, as I revise



these lines, has just perished by the hand of an assassin. This



official was De Plehve, who, during my acquaintance with him, was



only an undersecretary in the interior department, but was



taking, apparently, all the important duties from his superior,



M. Dournovo. At various times I met him to discuss the status of



sundry American insurance companies in Russia, and was favorably



impressed by his insight, vigor, and courtesy. It was, therefore,



a surprise to me when, on becoming a full minister, he bloomed



out as a most bitter, cruel, and evidently short-sighted



reactionary. The world stood amazed at the murderous cruelties



against the Jews at Kishineff, which he might easily have



prevented; and nothing more cruel or short-sighted than his



dealings with Finland has been known since Louis XIV revoked the



Edict of Nantes. I can only explain his course by supposing that



he sought to win the favor of the reactionary faction which, up



to the present time, has controlled the Czar, and thus to fight



his way toward the highest power. He made of the most loyal and



happy part of the empire the most disloyal and wretched; he



pitted himself against the patriotism, the sense of justice, and



all the highest interests and sentiments of the Finnish people;



and he met his death at the hands of an avenger, who, in



destroying the enemy of his country, has struck a fearful blow at



his country's happiness.







While a thoughtful American must condemn much which he sees in



Russia, there is one thing which he cannot but admire and



contrast to the disadvantage of his own country; and this is the



fact that Russia sets a high value upon its citizenship. Its



value, whatever it may be, is the result of centuries of



struggles, of long outpourings of blood and treasure; and



Russians believe that it has been bought at too great a price and



is in every way too precious to be lavished and hawked about as a



thing of no value. On the other hand, when one sees how the



citizenship of the United States, which ought to be a millionfold



more precious than that of Russia, is conferred loosely upon tens



of thousands of men absolutely unfit to exercise it,--whose



exercise of it seems, at times, likely to destroy republican



government; when one sees the power of conferring it granted to



the least respectable class of officials at the behest of ward



politicians, without proper safeguards and at times without any



regard to the laws; when one sees it prostituted by men of the



most unfit class,--and, indeed, of the predatory class,--who have



left Europe just long enough to obtain it, and then left America



in order to escape the duties both of their native and their



adopted country, and to avail themselves of the privileges of



both citizenships without one thought of the duties of either,



using them often in careers of scoundrelism,--one feels that



Russia is nearer the true ideal in this respect than we are.







As a matter of fact, there is with us no petty joint-stock



company in which an interest is not virtually held to be superior



to this citizenship of ours for which such sacrifices have been



made, and for which so many of our best men have laid down their



lives. No stockholder in the pettiest manufacturing company



dreams of admitting men to share in it unless they show their



real fitness to be thus admitted; but admission to American



citizenship is surrounded by no such safeguards: it has been



cheapened and prostituted until many who formerly revered it have



come to scoff at it. From this evil, at least, Russia is free.















CHAPTER XXXV







"ALL SORTS AND CONDITIONS OF MEN" IN RUSSIA--1892-1894







Still another department which interested me was that known as



the "Ministry of Public Enlightenment," its head being Count



Delyanoff. He was certainly a man of culture; but the title of



his department was a misnomer, for its duty was clearly to



prevent enlightenment in the public at large. The Russian theory



is, evidently, that a certain small number should be educated up



to a certain point for the discharge of their special duties; but



that, beyond this, anything like the general education of the



people is to be discouraged; hence the Russian peasant is the



most ignorant and helpless in Christendom.







There was evidently a disposition among very many of the most



ardent Russians to make a merit of this imperfect civilization,



and to cultivate hatred for any people whom they clearly saw



possessing anything better: hence it came that, just as so many



Frenchmen hate Great Britain, and so many in the backward,



slipshod regions of our country hate New England, it was quite



the fashion among large classes of Russians to hate everything



German, and especially to detest the Baltic provinces.







One evening during my stay a young Russian at a social gathering



of military and other officials voiced this feeling by saying, "I



hope the time will soon come when we shall have cleared out all



these Germans from the Russian service; they are the curse of the



country." Thereupon a young American present, who was especially



noted for his plain speaking, immediately answered, "How are you



going to do it? I notice that, as a rule, you rarely give a



position which really involves high responsibility to a Russian;



you generally give it to a German. When the Emperor goes to the



manoeuvers, does he dare trust his immediate surroundings to a



Russian? Never; he intrusts them to General Richter, who is a



Baltic-Province German. And when his Majesty is here in town does



he dare trust his personal safety to a Russian? Not at all; he



relies on Von Wahl, prefect of St. Petersburg, another German."



And so this plain-spoken American youth went on with a full



catalogue of leading Baltic-Province Germans in positions of the



highest responsibility, finally saying, "You know as well as I



that if the salvation of the Emperor depended on any one of you,



and you should catch sight of a pretty woman, you would instantly



forget your sovereign and run after her."







Richter and Von Wahl I knew, and they were certainly men whom one



could respect,--thoughtful, earnest, devoted to duty. Whenever



one saw the Emperor at a review, Richter was close at hand;



whenever their Majesties were at the opera, or in any public



place, there was Von Wahl with his eyes fastened upon them.







The young American might now add that when a man was needed to



defend Port Arthur another German was chosen--Stoessel, whose



heroism the whole world is now applauding, as it once applauded



Todleben, the general of German birth who carried off the Russian



laurels of the Crimean War.







One Russian official for whom there seemed to be deep and wide



respect was Count Woronzoff-Daschkoff; and I think that our



irrepressible American would have made an exception in his favor.



Calling upon him one day regarding the distribution of American



relief to famine-stricken peasants, I was much impressed by his



straightforward honesty: he was generally credited with stopping



the time-honored pilfering and plundering at the Winter Palace.







One of the most interesting of all the Russians I met was General



Annenkoff. His brother-in-law, Struve, Russian minister at



Washington, having given me a letter to him, our relations became



somewhat close. He had greatly distinguished himself by building



the trans-Caucasian railway, but his main feat had been the



annexation of Bokhara. The story, as told me by a member of his



family, is curious. While superintending his great force of men



and pushing on the laying of the rails through the desert, his



attention was suddenly called to some horsemen in the distance,



riding toward him with all their might. On their arrival their



leader was discovered to be a son of the Ameer of Bokhara. That



potentate having just died, the other sons were trying to make



their way to the throne by cutting each other's throats, but this



one had thought it wise to flee to the Russians for safety.



Annenkoff saw the point at once: with a large body of his cavalry



he started immediately for Bokhara, his guest by his side; pushed



his way through all obstacles; seated the young prince on the



throne; and so made him a Russian satrap. I shall speak later of



the visit of this prince to St. Petersburg. It was evident that



Annenkoff, during my stay, was not in favor. It was said that he



had been intrusted with large irrigation-works in order to give



employment to peasants during the famine, and that he had not



managed them well; but it was clear that this was not the main



difficulty: he was evidently thought too progressive and liberal,



and in that seething caldron of intrigue which centers at the



Winter Palace his ambitions had come to grief.







Another Russian who interested me was Glalkin Wraskoy. He was



devoted, night and day, to improving the Russian prison system.



That there was much need of such work was certain; but the fact



that this personage in government employ was so devoted to



improvements, and had called together in Russia a convention of



men interested in the amelioration of prison systems, led me to



think that the Russian Government is not so utterly and wilfully



cruel in its prison arrangements as the Western world has been



led to think.







Another interesting Russian was Count Orloff Davidoff; and on my



meeting him, just after his return from the Chicago Exposition,



at General Annenkoff's table, he entertained me with his



experiences. On my asking him what was the most amusing thing he



had seen in America, he answered that it was a "sacred concert,"



on Sunday, at a church in Colorado Springs, in which the music of



Strauss's waltzes and Offenbach's comic songs were leading



features, the audience taking them all very solemnly.







In the literary direction I found Prince John Galitzin's readings



from French dramas delightful. As to historical studies, the most



interesting man I found was Professor Demetrieff, who was brought



to my house by Pobedonostzeff. I had been reading Billbassoff's



"Life of the Empress Catherine"; and, on my asking some questions



regarding it, the professor said that at the death of the



Empress, her son, the Emperor Paul, intrusted the examination of



her papers to Rostopchine, who, on going through them, found a



casket containing letters and the like, which she had evidently



considered especially precious, and among these a letter from



Orloff, giving the details of the murder of her husband, Peter



III, at Ropscha. The letter, in substance, stated that Orloff and



his associates, having attempted to seize Peter, who was



evidently on his way to St. Petersburg to imprison the Empress



Catherine,--if not to put her to death,--the Emperor had



resisted; and that finally, in the struggle, he had been killed.



Professor Demetrieff then said that the Emperor Paul showed these



papers to his sons Alexander and Nicholas, who afterward



succeeded him on the throne, and expressed his devout



thankfulness that the killing of Peter III was not intentional,



and therefore that their grandmother was not a murderess.







This reminds me that, at my first visit to St. Petersburg, I



often passed, during my walks, the old palace of Paul, and that



there was one series of windows carefully barred: these belonging



to the rooms in which the Emperor Paul himself was assassinated



in order to protect the life of his son Alexander and of the



family generally.







Another Russian, Prince Serge Wolkonsky, was certainly the most



versatile man I have ever known: a playwright, an actor, an



essayist, an orator, a lecturer, and admirable in each of these



capacities. At a dinner given me, just before my departure from



St. Petersburg, by the Russians who had taken part in the Chicago



Exposition, I was somewhat troubled by the fact that the speeches



of the various officials were in Russian, and that, as I so



imperfectly understood them, I could not know what line to take



when my own speech came; but presently the chairman, Minister



Delyanoff, called upon young Prince Serge, who came forward very



modestly and, in admirable English, gave a summary of the whole



series of Russian speeches for my benefit, concluding with an



excellent speech of his own. His speeches and addresses at



Chicago were really remarkable; and, when he revisited America,



his lectures on Russian literature at Cornell University, at



Washington, and elsewhere, were worthy of the College de France.



This young man could speak fluently and idiomatically, not only



his own language, but English, French, German, Italian, and I



know not how many other tongues.







To meet scientific men of note my wont was to visit the Latin



Quarter; and there, at the house of Professor Woeikoff of St.



Petersburg University, I met, at various times, a considerable



body of those best worth knowing. One of those who made an



especially strong impression upon me was Admiral Makharoff.



Recently has come news of his death while commanding the Russian



fleet at Port Arthur--his flag-ship, with nearly all on board,



sunk by a torpedo. At court, in the university quarter, and later



at Washington, I met him often, and rated him among the



half-dozen best Russians I ever knew. Having won fame as a



vigorous and skilful commander in the Turkish war, he was



devoting himself to the scientific side of his profession. He had



made a success of his colossal ice-breaker in various northern



waters, and was now giving his main thoughts to the mapping out,



on an immense scale, of all the oceans, as regards winds and



currents. As explained by him, with quiet enthusiasm, it seemed



likely to be one of the greatest triumphs of the inductive method



since Lord Bacon. With Senator Semenoff and Prince Gregory



Galitzin I had very interesting talks on their Asiatic travels,



and was greatly impressed by the simplicity and strength of



Mendeleieff, who is certainly to-day one of two or three foremost



living authorities in chemistry. Although men of science, unless



they hold high official positions, are not to be seen at court, I



was glad to find that there were some Russian nobles who



appreciated them; and an admirable example of this was once shown



at my own house. It was at a dinner, when there was present a



young Russian of very high lineage; and I was in great doubt as



to the question of precedence, this being a matter of grave



import under the circumstances. At last my wife went to the



nobleman himself and asked him frankly regarding it. His answer



did him credit: he said, "I should be ashamed to take precedence



here of a man like Mendeleieff, who is an honor to Russia in the



eyes of the whole world; and I earnestly hope that he may be



given the first place."







There were also various interesting women in St. Petersburg



society, the reception afternoons of two of them being especially



attractive: they were, indeed, in the nature of the French salons



under the old regime.







One of these ladies--the Princess Wolkonsky--seemed to interest



all men not absorbed in futilities; and the result was that one



heard at her house the best men in St. Petersburg discussing the



most interesting questions.







The other was the Austrian ambassadress, Countess Wolkenstein,



whom I had slightly known, years before, as Countess Schleinitz,



wife of the minister of the royal household at Berlin. On her



afternoons one heard the best talk by the most interesting men;



and it was at the salons of these two ladies that there took



place the conversations which I have recorded in my "History of



the Warfare of Science," showing the development of a legend



regarding the miraculous cure of the Archbishop of St. Petersburg



by Father Ivan of Cronstadt.







Another place which especially attracted me was the house of



General Ignatieff, formerly ambassador at Constantinople, where,



on account of his alleged want of scruples in bringing on the war



with Russia, he received the nickname "Mentir Pasha." His wife



was the daughter of Koutousoff, the main Russian opponent of



Napoleon in 1812; and her accounts of Russia in her earlier days



and of her life in Constantinople were at times fascinating.







I remember meeting at her house, on one occasion, the Princess



Ourousoff, who told me that the Emperor Alexander had said to



her, "I wish that every one could see Sardou's play 'Thermidor'



and discover what revolution really is"; and that she had



answered, "Revolutions are prepared long before they break out."



That struck me as a very salutary bit of philosophy, which every



Russian monarch would do well to ponder.







The young Princess Radzivill was also especially attractive. In



one of her rooms hung a portrait of Balzac, taken just after



death, and it was most striking. This led her to give me very



interesting accounts of her aunt, Madame de Hanska, to whom



Balzac wrote his famous letters, and whom he finally married. I



met at her house another lady of high degree, to whom my original



introduction had been somewhat curious. Dropping in one afternoon



at the house of Henry Howard, the British first secretary, I met



in the crowd a large lady, simply dressed, whom I had never seen



before. Being presented to her, and not happening to catch her



name, I still talked on, and found that she had traveled, first



in Australia, then in California, thence across our continent to



New York; and her accounts of what she had seen interested me



greatly. But some little time afterward I met her again at the



house of Princess Radzivill, and then found that she was the



English Duchess of Buckingham. One day I had been talking with



the Princess and her guest on the treasures of the Imperial



Library, and especially the wonderful collection of autographs,



among them the copy-book of Louis XIV when a child, which showed



the pains taken to make him understand, even in his boyhood, that



he was an irresponsible autocrat. On one of its pages the line to



be copied ran as follows:







L'hommage est du aux Roys, ils font ce qu'il leur plaist.--LOUIS.







Under this the budding monarch had written the same words six



times, with childish care to keep the strokes straight and the



spaces regular. My account of this having led the princess to ask



me to take her and her friend to the library and to show them



some of these things, I gladly agreed, wrote the director,



secured an appointment for a certain afternoon, and when the time



came called for the ladies. But a curious contretemps arose. I



had met, the day before, two bright American ladies, and on their



asking me about the things best worth seeing, I had especially



recommended them to visit the Imperial Library. On arriving at



the door with the princess and the duchess, I was surprised to



find that no preparations had been made to meet us,--in fact,



that our coming seemed to be a matter of surprise; and a



considerable time elapsed before the director and other officials



came to us. Then I learned what the difficulty was. The two



American ladies, in perfectly good faith, had visited the library



a few hours before; and, on their saying that the American



minister had recommended them to come, it had been taken for



granted at once that THEY were the princess and the duchess, and



they had been shown everything with almost regal honors, the



officials never discovering the mistake until our arrival.







The American colony at St. Petersburg was very small. Interesting



compatriots came from time to time on various errands, and I was



glad to see them; but one whose visits were most heartily



welcomed was a former consul, Mr. Prince, an original, shrewd



"down-easter," and his reminiscences of some of my predecessors



were full of interest to me.







One especially dwells in my mind. It had reference to a former



senator of the United States who, about the year 1840, was sent



to Russia as minister. There were various evidences in the



archives of the legation that sobriety was not this gentleman's



especial virtue, and among them very many copies of notes in



which the minister, through the secretary of legation, excused



himself from keeping engagements at the Foreign Office on the



ground of "sudden indisposition."







Mr. Prince told me that one day this minister's valet, who was an



Irishman, came to the consulate and said: "Oi 'll not stay wid



his igsillincy anny longer; Oi 've done wid him."







"What 's the trouble now?' said Mr. Prince.







"Well," said the man, "this morning Oi thought it was toime to



get his igsillincy out of bed, for he had been dhrunk about a



week and in bed most of the toime; and so Oi went to him, and



says Oi, gentle-loike, 'Would your igsillincy have a cup of



coffee?' whin he rose up and shtruck me in the face. On that Oi



took him by the collar, lifted him out of bed, took him acrass



the room, showed him his ugly face in the glass, and Oi said to



him, says Oi, 'Is thim the eyes of an invoy extraorr-rrdinarry



and ministher plinipotentiarry?' "







Among interesting reminders of my predecessors was a letter in



the archives, written about the year 1832 by Mr. Buchanan,



afterward senator, minister in London, Secretary of State, and



President of the United States. It was a friendly missive to an



official personage in our country, and went on somewhat as



follows: "I feel almost ashamed to tell you that your letters to



me, mine to you, and, indeed, everything that has come and gone



between us by mail, has been read by other eyes than ours. This



was true of your last letter to me, and, without doubt, it will



be true of this letter. Can you imagine it? Think of the moral



turpitude of a creature employed to break open private letters



and to read them! Can you imagine work more degrading? What a



dirty dog he must be! how despicable, indeed, he must seem to



himself!" And so Mr. Buchanan went on until he wound up as



follows: "Not only does this person read private letters, but he



is a forger: he forges seals, and I regret to say that his



imitation of the eagle on our legation seal is a VERY SORRY



BIRD." Whether this dose had any salutary effect on the official



concerned I never learned.







The troubles of an American representative at St. Petersburg are



many, and they generally begin with the search for an apartment.



It is very difficult indeed in that capital to find a properly



furnished suite of rooms for a minister, and since the American



representative has been made an ambassador this difficulty is



greater than ever. In my own case, by especial luck and large



outlay, I was able to surmount it; but many others had not been



so fortunate, and the result had generally been that, whereas



nearly every other power owned or held on long lease a house or



apartment for its representative,--simple, decent, dignified, and



known to the entire city,--the American representative had lived



wherever circumstances compelled him:--sometimes on the



ground-floor and sometimes in a sky-parlor, with the natural



result that Russians could hardly regard the American Legation as



on the same footing with that of other countries.







As I write, word comes that the present ambassador has been



unable to find suitable quarters save at a rent higher than his



entire salary; that the proprietors have combined, and agreed to



stand by each other in holding their apartments at an enormous



figure, their understanding being that Americans are rich and can



be made to pay any price demanded. Nothing can be more



short-sighted than the policy of our government in this respect,



and I shall touch upon it again.







The diplomatic questions between the United States and Russia



were many and troublesome; for, in addition to that regarding the



Behring Sea fisheries, there were required additional



interpretations of the Buchanan treaty as to the rights of



Americans to hold real estate and to do business in Russia;



arrangements for the participation of Russians in the Chicago



Exposition; the protection of various American citizens of



Russian birth, and especially of Israelites who had returned to



Russia; care for the great American life-insurance interests in



the empire; the adjustment of questions arising out of Russian



religious relations with Alaska and the islands of the Northern



Pacific; and last, but not least, the completion of the



extradition treaty between the two nations by the incorporation



of safeguards which would prevent its use against purely



political offenders.







Especial attention to Israelite cases was also required. Some of



these excited my deep sympathy; and, having made a very careful



study of the subject, I wrote to Secretary Gresham a despatch



upon it in obedience to his special request. It was the longest



despatch I have ever written; and, in my apology to the secretary



for its length I stated that it was prepared with no expectation



that he would find time to read it, but with the idea that it



might be of use at the State Department for reference. In due



time I received a very kind answer stating that he had read every



word of it, and thanked me most heartily for--it. The whole



subject is exceedingly difficult; but it is clear that Russia has



made, and is making, a fearful mistake in her way of dealing with



it. There are more Israelites in Russia than in all the remainder



of the world; and they are crowded together, under most



exasperating regulations, in a narrow district just inside her



western frontier, mainly extending through what was formerly



Poland, with the result that fanaticism--Christian on one side



and Jewish on the other--has developed enormously. The Talmudic



rabbis are there at their worst; and the consequences are evil,



not only for Russia, but for our own country. The immigration



which comes to us from these regions is among the very worst that



we receive from any part of the world. It is, in fact, an



immigration of the unfittest; and, although noble efforts have



been made by patriotic Israelites in the United States to meet



the difficulty, the results have been far from satisfactory.







There were, of course, the usual adventurous Americans in



political difficulties, enterprising Americans in business



difficulties, and pretended Americans attempting to secure



immunity under the Stars and Stripes. The same ingenious efforts



to prostitute American citizenship which I had seen during my



former stay in Germany were just as constant in Russia. It was



the same old story. Emigrants from the Russian Empire, most of



them extremely undesirable, had gone to the United States; stayed



just long enough to secure naturalization,--had, indeed, in some



cases secured it fraudulently before they had stayed the full



time; and then, having returned to Russia, were trying to



exercise the rights and evade the duties of both countries.







Many of these cases were exceedingly vexatious; and so, indeed,



were some which were better founded. The great difficulty of a



representative of the United States in Russia is, first, that the



law of the empire is so complicated that,--to use the words of



King James regarding Bacon's "Novum Organum,"--"Like the Peace of



God, it passeth all understanding." It is made up of codes in



part obsolete or obsolescent; ukases and counter-ukases; imperial



directions and counter-directions; ministerial orders and



counter-orders; police regulations and counter-regulations; with



no end of suspensions, modifications, and exceptions.







The second difficulty is the fact that the Buchanan treaty of



1832, which guaranteed, apparently, everything desirable to



American citizens sojourning in the empire, has been gradually



construed away until its tattered remnants are practically



worthless. As the world has discovered, Russia's strong point is



not adherence to her treaty promises.







In this respect there is a great difference between Russia and



Germany. With the latter we have made careful treaties, the laws



are well known, and the American representative feels solid



ground beneath his feet; but in Russia there is practically



nothing of the kind, and the representative must rely on the main



principles of international law, common sense, and his own powers



of persuasion.







A peculiar duty during my last stay in St. Petersburg was to



watch the approach of cholera, especially on the Persian



frontier. Admirable precautions had been taken for securing



telegraphic information; and every day I received notices from



the Foreign Office as a result, which I communicated to



Washington. For ages Russia had relied on fetishes of various



kinds to preserve her from great epidemics; but at last her



leading officials had come to realize the necessity of applying



modern science to the problem, and they did this well. In the



city "sanitary columns" were established, made up of small squads



of officials representing the medical and engineering professions



and the police; these visited every nook and corner of the town,



and, having extraordinary powers for the emergency, compelled



even the most dirty people to keep their premises clean.



Excellent hospitals and laboratories were established, and of



these I learned much from a former Cornell student who held an



important position in one of them. Coming to town three or four



times a week from my summer cottage in Finland, I was struck by



the precautions on the Finnish and other railways: notices of



what was to be done to prevent cholera and to meet it were



posted, in six different languages; disinfectants were made



easily accessible; the seats and hangings in the railway-cars



were covered with leather cloth frequently washed with



disinfectants; and to the main trains a hospital-car was



attached, while a temporary hospital, well equipped, was



established at each main station. In spite of this, the number of



cholera patients at St. Petersburg in the middle of July rose to



a very high figure, and the number of deaths each day from



cholera was about one hundred.







Of these victims the most eminent was Tschaikovsky, the composer,



a man of genius and a most charming character, to whom Mr. Andrew



Carnegie had introduced me at New York. One evening at a



dinner-party he poured out a goblet of water from a decanter on



the table, drank it down, and next day was dead from Asiatic



cholera. But, with this exception, the patients were, so far as I



learned, almost entirely from the peasant class. Although boiled



water was supplied for drinking purposes, and some



public-spirited individuals went so far as to set out samovars



and the means of supplying hot tea to peasant workmen, the answer



of one of the muzhiks, when told that he ought to drink boiled



water, indicated the peasant view: "If God had wished us to drink



hot water, he would have heated the Neva."















CHAPTER XXXVI







MY RECOLLECTIONS OF POBEDONOSTZEFF--1892-1894







On arriving at St. Petersburg in 1892 to take charge of the



American legation, there was one Russian whom I more desired to



meet than any other--Constantine Pobedonostzeff. For some years



various English and American reviews had been charging him with



bigotry, cruelty, hypocrisy, and, indeed, with nearly every



hateful form of political crime; but the fact remained that under



Alexander III he was the most influential personage in the



empire, and that, though bearing the title of "procurator-general



of the Most Holy Synod," he was evidently no less powerful in



civil than in ecclesiastical affairs.







As to his history, it was understood to be as follows: When the



Grand Duke Nicholas, the eldest son of Alexander II,--a young man



of gentle characteristics, greatly resembling his father,--died



upon the Riviera, the next heir to the throne was his brother



Alexander, a stalwart, taciturn guardsman, respected by all who



knew him for honesty and directness, but who, having never looked



forward to the throne, had been brought up simply as a soldier,



with few of the gifts and graces traditional among the heirs of



the Russian monarchy since the days of Catherine.







Therefore it was that it became necessary to extemporize for this



soldier a training which should fit him for the duties of the



position so unexpectedly opened to him; and the man chosen as his



tutor was a professor at Moscow, distinguished as a jurist and



theologian,--a man of remarkable force of character, and devoted



to Russian ideas as distinguished from those of Western Europe:



Constantine Pobedonostzeff.







During the dark and stormy days toward the end of his career,



Alexander II had called in as his main adviser General



Loris-Melikoff, a man of Armenian descent, in whom was mingled



with the shrewd characteristics of his race a sincere desire to



give to Russia a policy and development in accordance with modern



ideas.







The result the world knows well. The Emperor, having taken the



advice of this and other councilors,--deeply patriotic men like



Miloutine, Samarine, and Tcherkassky,--had freed the serfs within



his empire (twenty millions in all); had sanctioned a vast scheme



by which they were to arrive at the possession of landed



property; had established local self-government in the various



provinces of his empire; had improved the courts of law; had



introduced Western ideas into legal procedure; had greatly



mitigated the severities formerly exercised toward the Jews; and



had made all ready to promulgate a constitution on his



approaching birthday.







But this did not satisfy the nihilistic sect. What more they



wanted it is hard to say. It is more than doubtful whether Russia



even then had arrived at a stage of civilization when the



institutions which Alexander II had already conceded could be



adopted with profit; but the leaders of the anarchic movement,



with their vague longings for fruit on the day the tree was



planted, decreed the Emperor's death--the assassination of the



greatest benefactor that Russia has ever known, one of the



greatest that humanity has known. It was, perhaps, the most



fearful crime ever committed against liberty and freedom; for it



blasted the hopes and aspirations of over a hundred millions of



people, and doubtless for many generations.







On this the sturdy young guardsman became the Emperor Alexander



III. It is related by men conversant with Russian affairs that,



at the first meeting of the imperial councilors, Loris-Melikoiff,



believing that the young sovereign would be led by filial



reverence to continue the liberal policy to which the father had



devoted his life, made a speech taking this for granted, and that



the majority of those present, including the Emperor, seemed in



accord with him; when suddenly there arose a tall, gaunt,



scholarly man, who at first very simply, but finally very



eloquently, presented a different view. According to the



chroniclers of the period, Pobedonostzeff told the Emperor that



all so-called liberal measures, including the constitution, were



a delusion; that, though such things might be suited to Western



Europe, they were not suited to Russia; that the constitution of



that empire had been, from time immemorial, the will of the



autocrat, directed by his own sense of responsibility to the



Almighty; that no other constitution was possible in Russia; that



this alone was fitted to the traditions, the laws, the ideas of



the hundred and twenty millions of various races under the



Russian scepter; that in other parts of the world constitutional



liberty, so called, had already shown itself an absurdity; that



socialism, anarchism, and nihilism, with their plots and bombs,



were appearing in all quarters; that murder was plotted against



rulers of nations everywhere, the best of presidents having been



assassinated in the very country where free institutions were



supposed to have taken the most complete hold; that the principle



of authority in human government was to be saved; and that this



principle existed as an effective force only in Russia.







This speech is said to have carried all before it. As its



immediate result came the retirement of Loris-Melikoff, followed



by his death not long afterward; the entrance of Pobedonostzeff



among the most cherished councilors of the Emperor; the



suppression of the constitution; the discouragement of every



liberal tendency; and that fanatical reaction which has been in



full force ever since.







This was the man whom I especially desired to see and to



understand; and therefore it was that I was very glad to receive



from the State Department instructions to consult with him



regarding some rather delicate matters needing adjustment between



the Greek Church and our authorities in Alaska, and also in



relation to the representation of Russia at the Chicago



Exposition.







I found him, as one of the great ministers of the crown, residing



in a ministerial palace, but still retaining, in large measure,



his old quality of professor. About him was a beautiful library,



with every evidence of a love for art and literature. I had gone



into his presence with many feelings of doubt. Against no one in



Russia had charges so bitter been made in my hearing: it was



universally insisted that he was responsible for the persecution



of the Roman Catholics in Poland, of the Lutherans in the Baltic



provinces and in Finland, of the Stundists in Central Russia, and



of the dissenting sects everywhere. He had been spoken of in the



English reviews as the "Torquemada of the nineteenth century,"



and this epithet seemed to be generally accepted as fitting.







I found him a scholarly, kindly man, ready to discuss the



business which I brought before him, and showing a wide interest



in public affairs. There were few, if any, doctrines, either



political or theological, which we held in common, but he seemed



inclined to meet the wishes of our government as fully and fairly



as he could; and thus was begun one of the most interesting



acquaintances I have ever made.







His usual time of receiving his friends was on Sunday evening



between nine and twelve; and very many such evenings I passed in



his study, discussing with him, over glasses of fragrant Russian



tea, every sort of question with the utmost freedom.







I soon found that his reasons for that course of action to which



the world so generally objects are not so superficial as they are



usually thought. The repressive policy which he has so earnestly



adopted is based not merely upon his views as a theologian, but



upon his convictions as a statesman. While, as a Russo-Greek



churchman, he regards the established church of the empire as the



form of Christianity most primitive and pure; and while he sees



in its ritual, in its art, and in all the characteristics of its



worship the nearest approach to his ideals, he looks at it also



from the point of view of a statesman--as the greatest cementing



power of the vast empire through which it is spread.







This being the case, he naturally opposes all other religious



bodies in Russia as not merely inflicting injury upon



Christianity, but as tending to the political disintegration of



the empire. Never, in any of our conversations, did I hear him



speak a harsh word of any other church or of any religious ideas



opposed to his own; but it was clear that he regarded Protestants



and dissident sects generally as but agents in the progress of



disintegration which, in Western Europe, seemed approaching a



crisis, and that he considered the Roman Catholic Church in



Poland as practically a political machine managed by a hierarchy



in deadly hostility to the Russian Empire and to Russian



influence everywhere.







In discussing his own church, he never hesitated to speak plainly



of its evident shortcomings. Unquestionably, one of the wishes



nearest his heart is to reform the abuses which have grown up



among its clergy, especially in their personal habits. Here, too,



is a reason for any repressive policy which he may have exercised



against other religious bodies. Everything that detracts from the



established Russo-Greek Church detracts from the revenues of its



clergy, and, as these are pitifully small, aids to keep the



priests and their families in the low condition from which he is



so earnestly endeavoring to raise them. As regards the severe



policy inaugurated by Alexander III against the Jews of the



empire, which Pobedonostzeff, more than any other man, is



supposed to have inspired, he seemed to have no harsh feelings



against Israelites as such; but his conduct seemed based upon a



theory which, in various conversations, he presented with much



force: namely, that Russia, having within its borders more Jews



than exist in all the world besides, and having suffered greatly



from these as from an organization really incapable of



assimilation with the body politic, must pursue a repressive



policy toward them and isolate them in order to protect its rural



population.







While he was very civil in his expressions regarding the United



States, he clearly considered all Western civilization a failure.



He seemed to anticipate, before long, a collapse in the systems



and institutions of Western Europe. To him socialism and



anarchism, with all they imply, were but symptoms of a



wide-spread political and social disease--indications of an



approaching catastrophe destined to end a civilization which,



having rejected orthodoxy, had cast aside authority, given the



force of law to the whimsies of illiterate majorities, and



accepted, as the voice of God, the voice of unthinking mobs,



blind to their own interests and utterly incapable of working out



their own good. It was evident that he regarded Russia as



representing among the nations the idea of Heaven-given and



church-anointed authority, as the empire destined to save the



principle of divine right and the rule of the fittest.







Revolutionary efforts in Russia he discussed calmly. Referring to



Loris-Melikoff, the representative of the principles most



strongly opposed to his own, no word of censure escaped him. The



only evidence of deep feeling on this subject he ever showed in



my presence was when he referred to the writings of a well-known



Russian refugee in London, and said, "He is a murderer."







As to public instruction, he evidently held to the idea so



thoroughly carried out in Russia: namely, that the upper class,



which is to conduct the business of the state, should be highly



educated, but that the mass of the people need no education



beyond what will keep them contented in the humble station to



which it has pleased God to call them. A very curious example of



his conservatism I noted in his remarks regarding the droshkies



of St. Petersburg. The droshky-drivers are Russian peasants,



simple and, as a rule, pious; rarely failing to make the sign of



the cross on passing a church or shrine, or at any other moment



which seems to them solemn. They are possibly picturesque, but



certainly dirty, in their clothing and in all their surroundings.



A conveyance more wretched than the ordinary street-droshky of a



Russian city could hardly be conceived, and measures had been



proposed for improving this system; but he could see no use in



them. The existing system was thoroughly Russian, and that was



enough. It appealed to his conservatism. The droshky-drivers,



with their Russian caps, their long hair and beards, their



picturesque caftans, and their deferential demeanor, satisfied



his esthetic sense.







What seemed to me a clash between his orthodox conservatism on



one side, and his Russian pride on the other, I discovered on my



return from a visit to Moscow, in which I had sundry walks and



talks with Tolstoi. On my alluding to this, he showed some



interest. It was clear that he was separated by a whole orb of



thought from the great novelist, yet it was none the less evident



that he took pride in him. He naturally considered Tolstoi as



hopelessly wrong in all his fundamental ideas, and yet was



himself too much of a man of letters not to recognize in his



brilliant countryman one of the glories of Russia.







But the most curious--indeed, the most amazing--revelation of the



man I found in his love for American literature. He is a wide



reader; and, in the whole breadth of his reading, American



authors were evidently among those he preferred. Of these his



favorites were Hawthorne, Lowell, and, above all, Emerson.



Curious, indeed, was it to learn that this "arch-persecutor,"



this "Torquemada of the nineteenth century," this man whose hand



is especially heavy upon Catholics and Protestants and dissenters



throughout the empire, whose name is spoken with abhorrence by



millions within the empire and without it, still reads, as his



favorite author, the philosopher of Concord. He told me that the



first book which he ever translated into Russian was Thomas a



Kempis's "Imitation of Christ"; and of that he gave me the Latin



original from which he made his translation, with a copy of the



translation itself. But he also told me that the next book he



translated was a volume of Emerson's "Essays," and he added that



for years there had always lain open upon his study table a



volume of Emerson's writings.







There is, thus clearly, a relation of his mind to the literature



of the Western world very foreign to his feelings regarding



Western religious ideas. This can be accounted for perhaps by his



own character as a man of letters. That he has a distinct



literary gift is certain. I have in my possession sundry articles



of his, and especially a poem in manuscript, which show real



poetic feeling and a marked power of expression. It is a curious



fact that, though so addicted to English and American literature,



he utterly refuses to converse in our language. His medium of



communication with foreigners is always French. On my asking him



why he would not use our language in conversation, he answered



that he had learned it from books, and that his pronunciation of



it would expose him to ridicule.







In various circles in St. Petersburg I heard him spoken of as a



hypocrite, but a simple sense of justice compels me to declare



this accusation unjust. He indeed retires into a convent for a



portion of every year to join the monks in their austerities; but



this practice is, I believe, the outgrowth of a deep religious



feeling. On returning from one of these visits, he brought to my



wife a large Easter egg of lacquered work, exquisitely



illuminated. I have examined, in various parts of Europe,



beautiful specimens of the best periods of mediaeval art; but in



no one of them have I found anything in the way of illumination



more perfect than this which he brought from his monkish



brethren. In nothing did he seem to unbend more than in his



unfeigned love for religious art as it exists in Russia. He



discussed with me one evening sundry photographs of the new



religious paintings in the cathedral of Kieff in a spirit which



revealed this feeling for religious art as one of the deepest



characteristics of his nature.







He was evidently equally sensitive to the beauties of religious



literature. Giving me various books containing the services of



the Orthodox Church, he dwelt upon the beauty of the Slavonic



version of the Psalms and upon the church hymnology.







The same esthetic side of his nature was evident at various great



church ceremonies. It has happened to me to see Pius IX celebrate



mass, both at the high altar of St. Peter's and in the Sistine



Chapel, and to witness the ceremonies of Holy Week and of Easter



at the Roman basilicas, and at the time it was hard to conceive



anything of the kind more impressive; but I have never seen any



church functions, on the whole, more imposing than the funeral



service of the Emperor Nicholas during my first visit to Russia,



and various imperial weddings, funerals, name-days, and the like,



during my second visit. On such occasions Pobedonostzeff



frequently came over from his position among the ministers of the



crown to explain to us the significance of this or that feature



in the ritual of music. It was plain that these things touched



what was deepest in him; it must be confessed that his attachment



to the church is sincere.







Nor were these impressions made upon me alone. It fell to my lot



to present to him one of the most eminent journalists our country



has produced--Charles A. Dana, a man who could discuss on even



terms with any European statesman all the leading modern



questions. Dana had been brought into close contact with many



great men; but it was plain to see--what he afterward



acknowledged to me--that he was very deeply impressed by this



eminent Russian. The talk of two such men threw new light upon



the characteristics of Pobedonostzeff, and strengthened my



impression of his intellectual sincerity.







In regard to the relation of the Russo-Greek Church to other



churches I spoke to him at various times, and found in him no



personal feeling of dislike to them. The nearest approach to such



a feeling appeared, greatly to my surprise, in sundry references



to the Greek Church as it exists in Greece. In these he showed a



spirit much like that which used to be common among High-church



Episcopalians in speaking of Low-church "Evangelicals." Mindful



of the earnest efforts made by the Anglican communion to come



into closer relations with the Russian branch of the Eastern



Church, I at various times broached that subject, and the



glimpses I obtained of his feeling regarding it surprised me.



Previously to these interviews I had supposed that the main



difficulty in the way to friendly relations between these two



branches of the church universal had its origin in the "filioque"



clause of the Nicene Creed. As is well known, the Eastern Church



adheres to that creed in its original form,--the form in which



the Holy Ghost is represented as "proceeding from the



Father,"--whereas the Western Church adopts the additional words,



"and from the Son." That the Russo-Greek Church is very tenacious



of its position in this respect, and considers the position of





the Western Church--Catholic and Protestant--as savoring of



blasphemy, is well known; and there was a curious evidence of



this during my second stay in Russia. Twice during that time I



heard the "Missa Solennis" of Beethoven. It was first given by a



splendid choir in the great hall of the University of



Helsingfors. That being in Finland, which is mainly Lutheran, the



Creed was sung in its Western form. Naturally, on going to hear



it given by a great choir at St. Petersburg, I was curious to



know how this famous clause would be dealt with. In various parts



of the audience were priests of the Russo-Greek faith, yet there



were very many Lutherans and Calvinists, and I watched with some



interest the approach of the passage containing the disputed



words; but when we reached this it was wholly omitted. Any



allusion to the "procession" was evidently forbidden. Great,



therefore, was my surprise when, on my asking Pobedonostzeff,[5]



as the representative of the Emperor in the Synod of the



empire,--the highest assemblage in the church, and he the most



influential man in it, really controlling archbishops and bishops



throughout the empire,--whether the "filioque" clause is an



insurmountable obstacle to union, he replied, "Not at all; that



is simply a question of dialectics. But with whom are we to



unite? Shall it be with the High-churchmen, the Broad-churchmen,



or the Low-churchmen? These are three different bodies of men



with distinctly different ideas of church order; indeed, with



distinctly different creeds. Which of these is the Orthodox



Church to regard as the representative of the Anglican



communion?" I endeavored to show him that the union, if it took



place at all, must be based on ideas and beliefs that underlie



all these distinctions; but he still returned to his original



proposition, which was that union is impossible until a more



distinct basis than any now attainable can be arrived at.











[5] I find, in a letter from Pobedonostzeff, that he spells his



name as here printed.











I suggested to him a visit to Great Britain and his making the



acquaintance of leading Englishmen; but to this he answered that



at his time of life he had no leisure for such a recreation; that



his duties absolutely forbade it.







In regard to relations with the Russo-Greek Church on our own



continent, he seemed to speak with great pleasure of the



treatment that sundry Russian bishops had received among us. He



read me letters from a member of the Russo-Greek hierarchy, full



of the kindliest expressions toward Americans, and especially



acknowledging their friendly reception of him and of his



ministrations. Both the archbishop in his letter, and



Pobedonostzeff in his talk, were very much amused over the fact



that the Americans, after extending various other courtesies to



the archbishop, offered him cigars.







He discussed the possibility of introducing the "Holy Orthodox



Church" into the United States, but always disclaimed all zeal in



religious propagandism, saying that the church authorities had



quite enough work to do in extending and fortifying the church



throughout the Russian Empire. He said that the pagan tribes of



the imperial dominions in Asia seemed more inclined to



Mohammedanism than to Christianity, and gave as the probable



reason the fact that the former faith is much the simpler of the



two. He was evidently unable to grasp the idea of the Congress of



Religions at the Chicago Exposition, and seemed inclined to take



a mildly humorous view of it as one of the droll inventions of



the time.







He appeared to hold our nation as a problem apart, and was,



perhaps, too civil in his conversations with me to include it in



the same condemnation with the nations of Western Europe which



had, in his opinion, gone hopelessly wrong. He also seemed drawn



to us by his admiration for Emerson, Hawthorne, and Lowell. When



Professor Norton's edition of Lowell's "Letters" came out, I at



once took it to him. It evidently gave him great



pleasure--perhaps because it revealed to him a very different



civilization, life, and personality from anything to which he had



been accustomed. Still, America seemed to be to him a sort of



dreamland. He constantly returned to Russian affairs as to the



great realities of the world. Discussing, as we often did, the



condition and future of the wild tribes and nations within the



Asiatic limits of the empire, he betrayed no desire either for



crusades or for intrigues to convert them; he simply spoke of the



legitimate influence of the church in civilizing them.







I recall a brilliant but denunciatory article, published in one



of the English reviews some time since by a well-known nihilist,



which contained, in the midst of various charges against the



Russian statesman, a description of his smile, which was



characterized as forbidding, and even ghastly. I watched for this



smile with much interest, but it never came. A smile upon his



face I have often seen; but it was a kindly smile, with no trace



of anything ghastly or cruel in it.







He seemed to take pleasure in the society of his old professorial



friends, and one of them he once brought to my table. This was a



professor of history, deeply conversant with the affairs of the



empire; and we discussed the character and career of Catherine



II. The two men together brought out a mass of curious



information, throwing a strange light into transactions which



only the most recent historians are beginning to understand,



among these the assassination of Czar Peter III, Catherine's



husband. On one occasion when Pobedonostzeff was visiting me I



tested his knowledge in regard to a matter of special interest,



and obtained a new side-light upon his theory of the universe.



There is at present on the island of Cronstadt, at the mouth of



the Neva, a Russo-Greek priest, Father Ivan, who enjoys



throughout the empire a vast reputation as a saintly worker of



miracles. This priest has a very spiritual and kindly face; is



known to receive vast sums for the poor, which he distributes



among them while he himself remains in poverty; and is supposed



not merely by members of the Russo-Greek Church, but by those of



other religious bodies, to work frequent miracles of healing. I



was assured by persons of the highest character--and those not



only Russo-Greek churchmen, but Roman Catholics and



Anglicans--that there could be no doubt as to the reality of



these miracles, and various examples were given me. So great is



Father Ivan's reputation in this respect that he is in constant



demand in all parts of the empire, and was even summoned to



Livadia during the last illness of the late Emperor. Whenever he



appears in public great crowds surround him, seeking to touch the



hem of his garment. His picture is to be seen with the portraits



of the saints in vast numbers of Russian homes, from the palaces



of the highest nobles to the cottages of the humblest peasants.







It happened to me on one occasion to have an experience which I



have related elsewhere, but which is repeated here as throwing



light on the ideas of the Russian statesman.







On my arrival in St. Petersburg my attention was at once aroused



by the portraits of Father Ivan. They ranged from photographs



absolutely true to life, which revealed a plain, shrewd, kindly



face, to those which were idealized until they bore a near



resemblance to the conventional representations of Jesus of



Nazareth.







One day, in one of the most brilliant reception-rooms of the



Northern capital, the subject of Father Ivan's miracles having



been introduced, a gentleman in very high social position, and



entirely trustworthy, spoke as follows: "There is something very



surprising about these miracles. I am slow to believe in them;



but there is one of them which is overwhelming and absolutely



true. The late Metropolitan of St. Petersburg, Archbishop



Isidore, loved quiet, and was very averse to anything which could



possibly cause scandal. Hearing of the wonders wrought by Father



Ivan, he summoned him to his presence and sternly commanded him



to abstain from all the things which had given rise to these



reported miracles, as sure to create scandal, and with this



injunction dismissed him. Hardly had the priest left the room



when the archbishop was struck with blindness, and he remained in



this condition until the priest returned and restored his sight



by intercessory prayer." When I asked the gentleman giving this



account if he directly knew these facts, he replied that he was,



of course, not present when the miracle was wrought; but that he



had the facts immediately from persons who knew all the parties



concerned, as well as all the circumstances of the case; and,



indeed, that these circumstances were matter of general



knowledge.







Sometime afterward, being at an afternoon reception in one of the



greater embassies, I brought up the same subject, when an eminent



general spoke as follows: "I am not inclined to believe in



miracles,--in fact, am rather skeptical; but the proofs of those



wrought by Father Ivan are overwhelming." He then went on to say



that the late metropolitan archbishop was a man who loved quiet



and disliked scandal; that on this account he had summoned Father



Ivan to his palace, and ordered him to put an end to the conduct



which had caused the reports concerning his miraculous powers;



and then, with a wave of his arm, had dismissed him. The priest



left the room, and from that moment the archbishop's arm was



paralyzed; and it remained so until the penitent prelate summoned



the priest again, by whose prayers the arm was restored to its



former usefulness. There was present at the time another person



besides myself who had heard the previous statement as to the



blindness of the archbishop; and, on our both asking the general



if he was sure that the archbishop's arm was paralyzed as stated,



he declared that he could not doubt it, as he had the account



directly from persons entirely trustworthy who were cognizant of



all the facts.







Sometime later, meeting Pobedonostzeff, I asked him which of



these stories was correct. He answered immediately, "Neither: in



the discharge of my duties I saw the Archbishop Isidore



constantly down to the last hours of his life, and no such event



ever occurred. He was never paralyzed and never blind." But the



great statesman and churchman then went on to say that, although



this story was untrue, there were a multitude of others quite as



remarkable in which he believed; and he gave me a number of



legends showing that Father Ivan possessed supernatural knowledge



and miraculous powers. These he unfolded to me with much detail,



and with such an accent of conviction that we seemed surrounded



by a mediaeval atmosphere in which signs and wonders were the



most natural things in the world.







As to his action on politics since my leaving Russia, the power



which he exercised over Alexander III has evidently been



continued during the reign of the young Nicholas II. In spite of



his eighty years, he seems to be, to-day, the leader of the



reactionary party.







During the early weeks of The Hague Conference, Count Munster, in



his frequent diatribes against its whole purpose, and especially



against arbitration, was wont to insist that the whole thing was



a scheme prepared by Pobedonostzeff to embarrass Germany; that,



as Russia was always wretchedly unready with her army, The Hague



Conference was simply a trick for gaining time against her rivals



who kept up better military preparations. There may have been



truth in part of this assertion; but the motive of the great



Russian statesman in favoring the conference was probably not so



much to gain time for the army as to gain money for the church.



With his intense desire to increase the stipends of the Russian



orthodox clergy, and thus to raise them somewhat above their



present low condition, he must have groaned over the enormous



sums spent by his government in the frequent changes in almost



every item of expenditure for its vast army--changes made in



times of profound peace, simply to show that Russia was keeping



her army abreast of those of her sister nations. Hence came the



expressed Russian desire to "keep people from inventing things."



It has always seemed to me that, while the idea underlying the



Peace Conference came originally from Jean de Bloch, there must



have been powerful aid from Pobedonostzeff. So much of good--and,



indeed, of great good --we may attribute to him as highly



probable, if not certain.







But, on the other hand, there would seem to be equal reason for



attributing to him, in these latter days, a fearful mass of evil.



To say nothing of the policy of Russia in Poland and elsewhere,



her dealings with Finland thus far form one of the blackest spots



on the history of the empire. Whether he originated this iniquity



or not is uncertain; but when, in 1892, I first saw the new



Russian cathedral rising on the heights above Helsingfors,--a



structure vastly more imposing than any warranted by the small



number of the "orthodox" in Finland,--with its architecture of



the old Muscovite type, symbolical of fetishism, I could not but



recognize his hand in it. It seemed clear to me that here was the



beginning of religious aggression on the Lutheran Finlanders,



which must logically be followed by political and military



aggression; and, in view of his agency in this as in everything



reactionary, I did not wonder at the attempt to assassinate him



not long afterward.







During my recent stay in Germany he visited me at the Berlin



Embassy. He was, as of old, apparently gentle, kindly, interested



in literature, not interested to any great extent in current



Western politics. This gentle, kindly manner of his brought back



forcibly to my mind a remark of one of the most cultivated women



I met in Russia, a princess of ancient lineage, who ardently



desired reasonable reforms, and who, when I mentioned to her a



report that Pobedonostzeff was weary of political life, and was



about to retire from office in order to devote himself to



literary pursuits, said: "Don't, I beg of you, tell me that; for



I have always noticed that whenever such a report is circulated,



it is followed by some new scheme of his, even more infernal than



those preceding it."







So much for the man who, during the present reign, seems one of



the main agents in holding Russian policy on the road to ruin. He



is indeed a study. The descriptive epithet which clings to



him--"the Torquemada of the nineteenth century"--he once



discussed with me in no unkindly spirit; indeed, in as gentle a



spirit as can well be conceived. His life furnishes a most



interesting study in churchmanship, in statesmanship, and in



human nature, and shows how some of the men most severely



condemned by modern historians--great persecutors, inquisitors,



and the like--may have based their actions on theories the world



has little understood, and may have had as little conscious



ferocity as their more tolerant neighbors.















CHAPTER XXXVII







WALKS AND TALES WITH TOLSTOI--MARCH, 1894







Revisiting Moscow after an absence of thirty-five years, the most



surprising thing to me was that there had been so little change.



With the exception of the new gallery of Russian art, and the



bazaar opposite the sacred gate of the Kremlin, things seemed as



I had left them just after the accession of Alexander II. There



were the same unkempt streets; the same peasantry clad in



sheepskins; the same troops of beggars, sturdy and dirty; the



same squalid crowds crossing themselves before the images at the



street corners; the same throngs of worshipers knocking their



heads against the pavements of churches; and above all loomed,



now as then, the tower of Ivan and the domes of St. Basil,



gloomy, gaudy, and barbaric. Only one change had taken place



which interested me: for the first time in the history of Russia,



a man of world-wide fame in literature and thought was abiding



there--Count Leo Tolstoi.







On the evening of my arrival I went with my secretary to his



weekly reception. As we entered his house on the outskirts of the



city, two servants in evening dress came forward, removed our fur



coats, and opened the doors into the reception-room of the



master. Then came a surprise. His living-room seemed the cabin of



a Russian peasant. It was wainscoted almost rudely and furnished



very simply; and there approached us a tall, gaunt Russian,



unmistakably born to command, yet clad as a peasant, his hair



thrown back over his ears on either side, his flowing blouse kept



together by a leathern girdle, his high jack-boots completing the



costume. This was Tolstoi.







Nothing could be more kindly than his greeting. While his dress



was that of a peasant, his bearing was the very opposite; for,



instead of the depressed, demure, hangdog expression of the



average muzhik, his manner, though cordial, was dignified and



impressive. Having given us a hearty welcome, he made us



acquainted with various other guests. It was a singular



assemblage. There were foreigners in evening dress, Moscow



professors in any dress they liked, and a certain number of



youth, evidently disciples, who, though clearly not of the



peasant class, wore the peasant costume. I observed these with



interest but certainly as long as they were under the spell of



the master they communicated nothing worth preserving; they



seemed to show "the contortions of the sibyl without the



inspiration."







The professors were much more engaging. The University of Moscow



has in its teaching body several strong men, and some of these



were present. One of them, whose department was philosophy,



especially interested and encouraged me by assurances that the



movement of Russian philosophy is "back to Kant." In the strange



welter of whims and dreams which one finds in Russia, this was to



me an unexpected evidence of healthful thought.







Naturally, I soon asked to be presented to the lady of the house,



and the count escorted us through a series of rooms to a salon



furnished much like any handsome apartment in Paris or St.



Petersburg, where the countess, with other ladies, all in full



evening dress, received us cordially. This sudden transition from



the peasant cabin of the master to these sumptuous rooms of the



mistress was startling; it seemed like scene-shifting at a



theater.







After some friendly talk, all returned to the rooms of the master



of the house, where tea was served at a long table from the



bubbling brazen urn--the samovar; and though there were some



twenty or thirty guests, nothing could be more informal. All was



simple, kindly, and unrestrained.







My first question was upon the condition of the people. Our



American legation had corresponded with Count Tolstoi and his



family as to distributing a portion of the famine fund sent from



the United States, hence this subject naturally arose at the



outset. He said that the condition of the peasants was still very



bad; that they had very generally eaten their draught-animals,



burned portions of their buildings to keep life in their bodies,



and reduced themselves to hopeless want. On my suggesting that



the new commercial treaty with Germany might help matters, he



thought that it would have but little effect, since only a small



portion of the total product of Russian agriculture is consumed



abroad. This led him to speak of some Americans and Englishmen



who had visited the famine-stricken districts, and, while he



referred kindly to them all, he seemed especially attracted by



the Quaker John Bellows of Gloucester, England, the author of the



wonderful little French dictionary. This led him to say that he



sympathized with the Quakers in everything save their belief in



property; that in this they were utterly illogical; that property



presupposes force to protect it. I remarked that most American



Quakers knew nothing of such force; that none of them had ever



seen an American soldier, save during our Civil War, and that



probably not one in hundreds of them had ever seen a soldier at



all. He answered, "But you forget the policeman." He evidently



put policemen and soldiers in the same category--as using force



to protect property, and therefore to be alike abhorred.







I found that to his disbelief in any right of ownership literary



property formed no exception. He told me that, in his view, he



had no right to receive money for the permission to print a book.



To this I naturally answered that by carrying out this doctrine



he would simply lavish large sums upon publishers in every



country of Europe and America, many of them rich and some of them



piratical; and that in my opinion he would do a much better thing



by taking the full value of his copyrights and bestowing the



proceeds upon the peasantry starving about him. To which he



answered that it was a question of duty. To this I agreed, but



remarked that beneath this lay the question what this duty really



was. It was a pleasure to learn from another source that the



countess took a different view of it, and that she had in some



way secured the proceeds of his copyrights for their very large



and interesting family. Light was thus thrown on Tolstoi's



remark, made afterward, that women are not so self-sacrificing as



men; that a man would sometimes sacrifice his family for an idea,



but that a woman would not.







He then went on to express an interest in the Shakers, and



especially in Frederick Evans. He had evidently formed an idea of



them very unlike the reality; in fact, the Shaker his imagination



had developed was as different from a Lebanon Shaker as an eagle



from a duck, and his notion of their influence on American



society was comical.







He spoke at some length regarding religion in Russia, evidently



believing that its present dominant form is soon to pass away. I



asked him how then he could account for the fact that while in



other countries women are greatly in the majority at church



services, in every Russian church the majority are men; and that



during the thirty-five years since my last visit to Moscow this



tendency had apparently increased. He answered, "All this is on



the surface; there is much deeper thought below, and the great



want of Russia is liberty to utter it." He then gave some



examples to show this, among them the case of a gentleman and



lady in St. Petersburg, whose children had been taken from them



and given to Princess ----, their grandmother, because the latter



is of the Orthodox Church and the former are not. I answered that



I had seen the children; that their grandmother had told me that



their mother was a screaming atheist with nihilistic tendencies,



who had left her husband and was bringing up the children in a



scandalous way,--teaching them to abjure God and curse the Czar;



that their father had thought it his duty to give all his



property away and work as a laborer; that therefore she--the



grandmother--had secured an order from the Emperor empowering her



to take charge of the children; that I had seen the children at



their grandmother's house, and that they had seemed very happy.



Tolstoi insisted that this statement by the grandmother was



simply made to cover the fact that the children were taken from



the mother because her belief was not of the orthodox pattern. My



opinion is that Tolstoi was mistaken, at least as to the father;



and that the father had been led to give away his property and



work with his hands in obedience to the ideas so eloquently



advocated by Tolstoi himself. Unlike his master, this gentleman



appears not to have had the advantage of a wife who mitigated his



ideas.







Tolstoi also referred to the difficulties which translators had



found in securing publishers for his most recent book--"The



Kingdom of God." On my assuring him that American publishers of



high standing would certainly be glad to take it, he said that he



had supposed the ideas in it so contrary to opinions dominant in



America as to prevent its publication there.







Returning to the subject of religion in Russia, he referred to



some curious incongruities; as, for example, the portrait of



Socrates forming part of a religious picture in the Annunciation



Church at the Kremlin. He said that evidently some monk, who had



dipped into Plato, had thus placed Socrates among the precursors



of Christ. I cited the reason assigned by Melanchthon for



Christ's descent into hell--namely, the desire of the Redeemer to



make himself known to Socrates, Plato, and the best of the



ancient philosophers; and I compared this with Luther's idea, so



characteristic of him, that Christ descended into hell in order



to have a hand-to-hand grapple and wrestle with Satan. This led



Tolstoi to give me a Russian legend of the descent into hell,



which was that, when Christ arrived there, he found Satan forging



chains, but that, at the approach of the Saviour, the walls of



hell collapsed, and Satan found himself entangled in his own



chains, and remained so for a thousand years.







In regard to the Jews, he said that he sympathized with them, but



that the statements regarding the persecution of them were



somewhat exaggerated. Kennan's statements regarding the treatment



of prisoners in Siberia he thought overdrawn at times, but



substantially true. He expressed his surprise that certain



leading men in the empire, whom he named, could believe that



persecution and the forcible repression of thought would have any



permanent effect at the end of the nineteenth century.







He then dwelt upon sundry evil conditions in Russia, on which my



comment was that every country, of course, had its own grievous



shortcomings; and I cited, as to America, the proverb: "No one



knows so well where the shoe pinches as he who wears it." At this



he asked me about lynch law in the United States, and expressed



his horror of it. I showed him that it was the inevitable result



of a wretched laxity and sham humanity in the administration of



our criminal law, which had led great bodies of people, more



especially in the Southern and extreme Western parts of the



country, to revert to natural justice and take the law into their



own hands; and I cited Goldwin Smith's profound remark that "some



American lynchings are proofs not so much of lawlessness as of a



respect for law."







He asked me where, besides this, the shoe pinched in the United



States. I told him that it pinched in various places, but that



perhaps the worst pinch arises from the premature admission to



full political rights of men who have been so benumbed and



stunted intellectually and morally in other countries that their



exercise of political rights in America is frequently an injury,



not only to others, but to themselves. In proof of this I cited



the case of the crowds whom I had seen some years before huddled



together in New York tenement-houses, preyed upon by their



liquor-selling landlords, their families perishing of typhoid and



smallpox on account of the negligence and maladministration of



the local politicians, but who, as a rule, were almost if not



quite ready to mob and murder those of us who brought in a new



health board and a better order of things; showing him that for



years the very class of people who suffered most from the old,



vile state of things did their best by their votes to keep in



power the men who maintained it.







We then passed to the subject of the trans-Siberian Railway. In



this he seemed interested, but in a vague way which added nothing



to my knowledge.







Asking me regarding my former visit to Moscow, and learning that



it was during the Crimean War, he said, "At that time I was in



Sebastopol, and continued there as a soldier during the siege."







As to his relations with the imperial government at present, he



said that he had been recently elected to a learned society in



Moscow, but that the St. Petersburg government had interfered to



stop the election; and he added that every morning, when he



awoke, he wondered that he was not on his way to Siberia.







On my leaving him, both he and the countess invited me to meet



them next day at the Tretiakof Museum of Russian Pictures; and



accordingly, on the following afternoon, I met them at that



greatest of all galleries devoted purely to Russian art. They



were accompanied by several friends, among them a little knot of



disciples--young men clad in simple peasant costume like that



worn by the master. It was evident that he was an acknowledged



lion at the old Russian capital, for as he led me about to see



the pictures which he liked best, he was followed and stared at



by many.







Pointing out to me some modern religious pictures in Byzantine



style painted for the Cathedral of Kieff, he said, "They



represent an effort as futile as trying to persuade chickens to



reenter the egg-shells from which they have escaped." He next



showed me two religious pictures; the first representing the



meeting of Jesus and Pilate, when the latter asked, "What is



truth?" Pilate was depicted as a rotund, jocose, cynical man of



the world; Jesus, as a street preacher in sordid garments, with



unkempt hair flowing over his haggard face,--a peasant fanatic



brought in by the police. Tolstoi showed an especial interest in



this picture; it seemed to reveal to him the real secret of that



famous question and its answer; the question coming from the



mighty of the earth, and the answer from the poor and oppressed.







The other picture represented the Crucifixion. It was painted in



the most realistic manner possible; nothing was idealized; it was



even more vividly realistic than Gebhardt's picture of the Lord's



Supper, at Berlin; so that it at first repelled me, though it



afterward exercised a certain fascination. That Tolstoi was



deeply interested was clear. He stood for a time in silence, as



if musing upon all that the sacrifice on Calvary had brought to



the world. Other representations of similar scenes, in the



conventional style of the older masters, he had passed without a



glance; but this spectacle of the young Galilean peasant, with



unattractive features, sordid garb, poverty-stricken companions,



and repulsive surroundings, tortured to death for preaching the



"kingdom of God" to the poor and down-trodden, seemed to hold him



fast, and as he pointed out various features in the picture it



became even more clear to me that sympathy with the peasant



class, and a yearning to enter into their cares and sorrows, form



the real groundwork of his life.







He then took me to a small picture of Jesus and his disciples



leaving the upper room at Jerusalem after the Last Supper. This,



too, was painted in the most realistic manner. The disciples,



simple-minded fishermen, rude in features and dress, were



plodding homeward, while Christ himself gazed at the stars and



drew the attention of his nearest companions to some of the



brightest. Tolstoi expressed especial admiration for this



picture, saying that at times it affected him like beautiful



music,--like music which draws tears, one can hardly tell why. It



was more and more evident, as he lingered before this and other



pictures embodying similar ideas, that sympathy for those



struggling through poverty and want toward a better life is his



master passion.







Among the pictures, not to be classed as religious, before which



he thus lingered were those representing the arrest of a nihilist



and the return of an exile from Siberia. Both were well painted,



and both revealed the same characteristic--sympathy with the



poor, even with criminals.







Some of the more famous historical pictures in the collection he



thought exaggerated; especially those representing the fury of



the Grand Duchess Sophia in her monastery prison, and the remorse



of Ivan the Terrible after murdering his son.







To my surprise, he agreed with me, and even went beyond me, in



rating landscape infinitely below religious and historical



painting, saying that he cared for landscape-painting only as



accessory to pictures revealing human life.







Among genre pictures, we halted before one representing a peasant



family grouped about the mother, who, with a sacred picture laid



upon her breast, after the Russian manner, was dying of famine.



This also seemed deeply to impress him.







We stopped next before a picture of a lady of high birth brought



before the authorities in order to be sent, evidently against her



will, to a convent. I cited the similar story from Manzoni's



"Promessi Sposi"; but, to my surprise, he seemed to know little



of that most fascinating of historical romances. This led to a



discussion in which he said he had once liked Walter Scott, but



had not read anything of his for many years; and he seemed



interested in my statement that although always an especial



admirer of Scott, I had found it almost impossible to induce the



younger generation to read him.







Stopping before a picture of Peter the Great's fatal conference



with his son Alexis, in reply to my remark upon the marvel that a



prince of such genius as Peter should have appeared at Moscow in



the seventeenth century, he said that he did not admire Peter,



that he was too cruel,--administering torture and death at times



with his own hands.







We next halted before a picture representing the horrible



execution of the Strelitzes. I said that "such pictures prove



that the world does, after all, progress slowly, in spite of what



pessimists say, and that in order to refute pessimists one has



only to refer to the improvements in criminal law." To this he



agreed cordially, and declared the abolition of torture in



procedure and penalty to be one great gain, at any rate.







We spoke of the present condition of things in Europe, and I told



him that at St. Petersburg the opinion very general among the



more thoughtful members of the diplomatic corps was that war was



not imminent; that the Czar, having himself seen the cruelties of



war during the late struggle in the Balkans, had acquired an



invincible repugnance to it. He acquiesced in this, but said that



it seemed monstrous to him that the peace of the empire and of



Europe should depend upon so slender a thread as the will of any



one man.







Our next walk was taken across the river Moskwa, on the ice, to



and through the Kremlin, and as we walked the conversation fell



upon literature. As to French literature, he thought Maupassant



the man of greatest talent, by far, in recent days, but that he



was depraved and centered all his fiction in women. For Balzac,



Tolstoi evidently preserved admiration, but he cared little,



apparently, for Daudet, Zola, and their compeers.







As to American literature, he said that Tourgueneff had once told



him that there was nothing in it worth reading; nothing new or



original; that it was simply a copy of English literature. To



this I replied that such criticism seemed to me very shallow;



that American literature was, of course, largely a growth out of



the parent stock of English literature, and must mainly be judged



as such; that to ask in the highest American literature something



absolutely different from English literature in general was like



looking for oranges upon an apple-tree; that there had come new



varieties in this growth, many of them original, and some



beautiful; but that there was the same sap, the same life-current



running through it all; and I compared the treatment of woman in



all Anglo-Saxon literature, whether on one side of the Atlantic



or the other, from Chaucer to Mark Twain, with the treatment of



the same subject by French writers from Rabelais to Zola. To this



he answered that in his opinion the strength of American



literature arises from the inherent Anglo-Saxon religious



sentiment. He expressed a liking for Emerson, Hawthorne, and



Whittier, but he seemed to have read at random, not knowing at



all some of the best things. He spoke with admiration of Theodore



Parker's writings, and seemed interested in my reminiscences of



Parker and of his acquaintance with Russian affairs. He also



revered and admired the character and work of William Lloyd



Garrison. He had read Longfellow somewhat, but was evidently



uncertain regarding Lowell,--confusing him, apparently, with some



other author. Among contemporary writers he knew some of



Howells's novels and liked them, but said: "Literature in the



United States at present seems to be in the lowest trough of the



sea between high waves." He dwelt on the flippant tone of



American newspapers, and told me of an interviewer who came to



him in behalf of an American journal, and wanted simply to know



at what time he went to bed and rose, what he ate, and the like.



He thought that people who cared to read such trivialities must



be very feeble-minded, but he said that the European press is, on



the whole, just as futile. On my attempting to draw from him some



statement as to what part of American literature pleased him



most, he said that he had read some publications of the New York



and Brooklyn Society for Ethical Culture, and that he knew and



liked the writings of Felix Adler. I then asked who, in the whole



range of American literature, he thought the foremost. To this he



made an answer which amazed me, as it would have astonished my



countrymen. Indeed, did the eternal salvation of all our eighty



millions depend upon some one of them guessing the person he



named, we should all go to perdition together. That greatest of



American writers was--Adin Ballou! Evidently, some of the



philanthropic writings of that excellent Massachusetts country



clergyman and religious communist had pleased him, and hence came



the answer.







The next day he came over to my hotel and we went out for a



stroll. As we passed along the streets I noticed especially what



I had remarked during our previous walks, that Tolstoi had a



large quantity of small Russian coins in his pockets; that this



was evidently known to the swarms of beggars who infest the



Kremlin and the public places generally; and that he always gave



to them.







On my speaking of this, he said he thought that any one, when



asked for money, ought to give it. Arguing against this doctrine,



I said that in the United States there are virtually no beggars,



and I might have gone on to discuss the subject from the



politico-economical point of view, showing how such



indiscriminate almsgiving in perpetual driblets is sure to create



the absurd and immoral system which one sees throughout



Russia,--hordes of men and women who are able to take care of



themselves, and who ought to be far above beggary, cringing and



whining to the passers-by for alms; but I had come to know the



man well enough to feel sure that a politico-economical argument



would slide off him like water from a duck's back, so I attempted



to take him upon another side, and said: "In the United States



there are virtually no beggars, though my countrymen are, I



really believe, among the most charitable in the world." To this



last statement he assented, referring in a general way to our



shipments of provisions to aid the famine-stricken in Russia.



"But," I added, "it is not our custom to give to beggars save in



special emergencies." I then gave him an account of certain



American church organizations which had established piles of



fire-wood and therefore enabled any able-bodied tramp, by sawing



or cutting some of it, to earn a good breakfast, a good dinner,



and, if needed, a good bed, and showed him that Americans



considered beggary not only a great source of pauperism, but as



absolutely debasing to the beggar himself, in that it puts him in



the attitude of a suppliant for that which, if he works as he



ought, he can claim as his right; that to me the spectacle of



Count Tolstoi virtually posing as a superior being, while his



fellow-Russians came crouching and whining to him, was not at all



edifying. To this view of the case he listened very civilly.







Incidentally I expressed wonder that he had not traveled more. He



then spoke with some disapprobation of travel. He had lived



abroad for a time, he said, and in St. Petersburg a few years,



but the rest of his life had been spent mainly in Moscow and the



interior of Russia. The more we talked together, the more it



became clear that this last statement explained some of his main



defects. Of all distinguished men that I have ever met, Tolstoi



seems to me most in need of that enlargement of view and



healthful modification of opinion which come from meeting men and



comparing views with them in different lands and under different



conditions. This need is all the greater because in Russia there



is no opportunity to discuss really important questions. Among



the whole one hundred and twenty millions of people there is no



public body in which the discussion of large public questions is



allowed; the press affords no real opportunity for discussion;



indeed, it is more than doubtful whether such discussion would be



allowed to any effective extent even in private correspondence or



at one's own fireside.







I remember well that during my former stay in St. Petersburg,



people who could talk English at their tables generally did so in



order that they might not betray themselves to any spy who might



happen to be among their servants.







Still worse, no one, unless a member of the diplomatic corps or



specially privileged, is allowed to read such books or newspapers



as he chooses, so that even this access to the thoughts of others



is denied to the very men who most need it.







Like so many other men of genius in Russia, then,--and Russia is



fertile in such,--Tolstoi has had little opportunity to take part



in any real discussion of leading topics; and the result is that



his opinions have been developed without modification by any



rational interchange of thought with other men. Under such



circumstances any man, no matter how noble or gifted, having



given birth to striking ideas, coddles and pets them until they



become the full-grown, spoiled children of his brain. He can at



last see neither spot nor blemish in them, and comes virtually to



believe himself infallible. This characteristic I found in



several other Russians of marked ability. Each had developed his



theories for himself until he had become infatuated with them,



and despised everything differing from them.







This is a main cause why sundry ghastly creeds, doctrines, and



sects--religious, social, political, and philosophic--have been



developed in Russia. One of these religious creeds favors the



murder of new-born children in order to save their souls; another



enjoins ghastly bodily mutilations for a similar purpose; others



still would plunge the world in flames and blood for the



difference of a phrase in a creed, or a vowel in a name, or a



finger more or less in making the sign of the cross, or for this



garment in a ritual, or that gesture in a ceremony.







In social creeds they have developed nihilism, which virtually



assumes the right of an individual to sit in judgment upon the



whole human race and condemn to death every other human being who



may differ in opinion or position from this self-constituted



judge.







In political creeds they have conceived the monarch as the



all-powerful and irresponsible vicegerent of God, and all the



world outside Russia as given over to Satan, for the reason that



it has "rejected the divine principle of authority."







In various branches of philosophy they have developed doctrines



which involve the rejection of the best to which man has attained



in science, literature, and art, and a return to barbarism.







In the theory of life and duty they have devised a pessimistic



process under which the human race would cease to exist.







Every one of these theories is the outcome of some original mind



of more or less strength, discouraged, disheartened, and



overwhelmed by the sorrows of Russian life; developing its ideas



logically and without any possibility of adequate discussion with



other men. This alone explains a fact which struck me



forcibly--the fact that all Tolstoi's love of humanity, real



though it certainly is, seems accompanied by a depreciation of



the ideas, statements, and proposals of almost every other human



being, and by virtual intolerance of all thought which seems in



the slightest degree different from his own.







Arriving in the Kremlin, he took me to the Church of the



Annunciation to see the portrait of Socrates in the religious



picture of which he had spoken; but we were too late to enter,



and so went to the Palace of the Synod, where we looked at the



picture of the Trinity, which, by a device frequently used in



street signs, represents, when looked at from one side, the



suffering Christ, from the other the Holy Ghost in the form of a



dove, and from the front the Almighty as an old man with a white



beard. What Tolstoi thought of the doctrine thus illustrated came



out in a subsequent conversation.







The next day he came again to my rooms and at once began speaking



upon religion. He said that every man is religious and has in him



a religion of his own; that religion results from the conception



which a man forms of his relations to his fellow-men, and to the



principle which in his opinion controls the universe; that there



are three stages in religious development: first, the childhood



of nations, when man thinks of the whole universe as created for



him and centering in him; secondly, the maturity of nations, the



time of national religions, when each nation believes that all



true religion centers in it,--the Jews and the English, he said,



being striking examples; and, finally, the perfected conception



of nations, when man has the idea of fulfilling the will of the



Supreme Power and considers himself an instrument for that



purpose. He went on to say that in every religion there are two



main elements, one of deception and one of devotion, and he asked



me about the Mormons, some of whose books had interested him. He



thought two thirds of their religion deception, but said that on



the whole he preferred a religion which professed to have dug its



sacred books out of the earth to one which pretended that they



were let down from heaven. On learning that I had visited Salt



Lake City two years before, he spoke of the good reputation of



the Mormons for chastity, and asked me to explain the hold of



their religion upon women. I answered that Mormonism could hardly



be judged by its results at present; that, as a whole, the



Mormons are, no doubt, the most laborious and decent people in



the State of Utah; but that this is their heroic period, when



outside pressure keeps them firmly together and arouses their



devotion; that the true test will come later, when there is less



pressure and more knowledge, and when the young men who are now



arising begin to ask questions, quarrel with each other, and



split the whole body into sects and parties.







This led to questions in regard to American women generally, and



he wished to know something of their condition and prospects. I



explained some features of woman's condition among us, showing



its evolution, first through the betterment of her legal status,



and next through provision for her advanced education; but told



him that so far as political rights are concerned, there had been



very little practical advance in the entire East and South of the



country during the last fifty years, and that even in the extreme



Western States, where women have been given political rights and



duties to some extent, the concessions have been wavering and



doubtful.







At this, he took up his parable and said that women ought to have



all other rights except political; that they are unfit to



discharge political duties; that, indeed, one of the great



difficulties of the world at present lies in their possession of



far more consideration and control than they ought to have. "Go



into the streets and bazaars," he said, "and you will see the



vast majority of shops devoted to their necessities. In France



everything centers in women, and women have complete control of



life: all contemporary French literature shows this. Woman is not



man's equal in the highest qualities; she is not so



self-sacrificing as man. Men will, at times, sacrifice their



families for an idea; women will not." On my demurring to this



latter statement, he asked me if I ever knew a woman who loved



other people's children as much as her own. I gladly answered in



the negative, but cited Florence Nightingale, Sister Dora, and



others, expressing my surprise at his assertion that women are



incapable of making as complete sacrifices for any good cause as



men. I pointed to the persecutions in the early church, when



women showed themselves superior to men in suffering torture,



degradation, and death in behalf of the new religion, and added



similar instances from the history of witchcraft. To this he



answered that in spite of all such history, women will not make



sacrifices of their own interest for a good cause which does not



strikingly appeal to their feelings, while men will do so; that



he had known but two or three really self-sacrificing women in



his life; and that these were unmarried. On my saying that



observation had led me to a very different conclusion, his



indictment took another form. He insisted that woman hangs upon



the past; that public opinion progresses, but that women are



prone to act on the opinion of yesterday or of last year; that



women and womanish men take naturally to old absurdities, among



which he mentioned the doctrines of the Trinity, "spiritism," and



homeopathy. At this I expressed a belief that if, instead of



educating women, as Bishop Dupanloup expressed it, "in the lap of



the church (sur les genoux de l'eglise)," we educate them in the



highest sense, in universities, they will develop more and more



intellectually, and so become a controlling element in the



formation of a better race; that, as strong men generally have



strong mothers, the better education of woman physically,



intellectually, and morally is the true way of bettering the race



in general. In this idea he expressed his disbelief, and said



that education would not change women; that women are illogical



by nature. At this I cited an example showing that women can be



exceedingly logical and close in argument, but he still adhered



to his opinion. On my mentioning the name of George Eliot, he



expressed a liking for her.







On our next walk, he took me to the funeral of one of his



friends. He said that to look upon the dead should rather give



pleasure than pain; that memento mori is a wise maxim, and



looking upon the faces of the dead a good way of putting it in



practice. I asked him if he had formed a theory as to a future



life, and he said in substance that he had not; but that, as we



came at birth from beyond the forms of space and time, so at



death we returned whence we came. I said, "You use the word



'forms' in the Kantian sense?" "Yes," he said, "space and time



have no reality."







We arrived just too late at the house of mourning. The dead man



had been taken away; but many of those who had come to do him



honor still lingered, and were evidently enjoying the "funeral



baked meats." There were clear signs of a carousal. The friends



who came out to meet us had, most of them, flushed faces, and one



young man in military uniform, coming down the stairs, staggered



and seemed likely to break his neck.







Tolstoi refused to go in, and, as we turned away, expressed



disgust at the whole system, saying, as well he might, that it



was utterly barbarous. He seemed despondent over it, and I tried



to cheer him by showing how the same custom of drinking strong



liquors at funerals had, only a few generations since, prevailed



in large districts of England and America, but that better ideas



of living had swept it away.







On our way through the street, we passed a shrine at which a mob



of peasants were adoring a sacred picture. He dwelt on the



fetishism involved in this, and said that Jesus Christ would be



infinitely surprised and pained were he to return to earth and



see what men were worshiping in his name. He added a story of a



converted pagan who, being asked how many gods he worshiped,



said: "One, and I ate him this morning." At this I cited



Browning's lines put into the mouth of the bishop who wished,



from his tomb,







          "To hear the blessed mutter of the mass,



           And see God made and eaten all day long."











I reminded him of his definition of religion given me on one of



our previous walks, and he repeated it, declaring religion to be



the feeling which man has regarding his relation to the universe,



including his fellow-men, and to the power which governs all.







The afternoon was closed with a visit to a Raskolnik, or Old



Believer, and of all our experiences this turned out to be the



most curious. The Raskolniks, or Old Believers, compose that



wide-spread sect which broke off from the main body of the



Russian Church when the patriarch of Moscow, Nikon, in the



seventeenth century attempted to remove various textual errors



from the Bible and ceremonial books. These books had been copied



and recopied during centuries until their condition had become



monstrous. Through a mistake of some careless transcriber, even



the name of Jesus had been travestied and had come to be spelled



with two e's; the crudest absurdities had been copied into the



test; important parts had become unintelligible; and the time had



evidently arrived for a revision. Nikon saw this, and in good



faith summoned scholars from Constantinople to prepare more



correct editions; but these revised works met the fate which



attends such revisions generally. The great body of the people



were attached to the old forms; they preferred them, just as in



these days the great body of English-speaking Protestants prefer



the King James Bible to the Revised Version, even though the



latter may convey to the reader more correctly what was dictated



by the Holy Spirit. The feeling of the monks, especially, against



Nikon's new version became virulent. They raised so strong an



opposition among the people that an army had to be sent against



them; at the siege of the Solovetsk Monastery the conflict was



long and bloody, and as a result a large body of people and



clergy broke off from the church. Of course the more these



dissenters thought upon what Nikon had done, the more utterly



evil he seemed; but this was not all. A large part of Russian



religious duty, so far as the people are concerned, consists in



making the sign of the cross on all occasions. Before Nikon's



time this had been done rather carelessly, but, hoping to impress



a religious lesson, he ordered it to be made with three extended



fingers, thus reminding the faithful of the Trinity. At this the



Raskolniks insisted that the sign of the cross ought to be made



with two fingers, and out of this difference arose more



bitterness than from all other causes put together. From that day



to this the dissenters have insisted on enjoying the privilege of



reading the old version with all its absurdities, of spelling the



word Jesus with two e's, of crossing themselves with two fingers,



and of cursing Nikon.







This particular Raskolnik, or Old Believer, to whom Tolstoi took



me, was a Muscovite merchant of great wealth, living in a superb



villa on the outskirts of the city, with a large park about it;



the apartments, for size and beauty of decoration, fit for a



royal palace--the ceilings covered with beautiful frescos, and



the rooms full of statues and pictures by eminent artists, mainly



Russian and French. He was a man of some education, possessed a



large library, loved to entertain scientific men and to aid



scientific effort, and managed to keep on good terms with his



more fanatical coreligionists on one side and with the government



on the other, so that in emergencies he was an efficient



peacemaker between them. We found him a kindly, gentle old man,



with long, white hair and beard, and he showed us with evident



pleasure the principal statues and pictures, several of the



former being by Antokolski, the greatest contemporary Russian



sculptor. In the sumptuous dining-room, in which perhaps a



hundred persons could sit at table, he drew our attention to some



fine pictures of Italian scenes by Smieradsky, and, after passing



through the other rooms, took us into a cabinet furnished with



the rarest things to be found in the Oriental bazaars. Finally,



he conducted us into his private chapel, where, on the



iconostas,--the screen which, in accordance with the Greek



ritual, stands before the altar,--the sacred images of the



Saviour and various saints were represented somewhat differently



from those in the Russo-Greek Church, especially in that they



extended two fingers instead of three. To this difference I



called his attention, and he at once began explaining it. Soon he



grew warm, and finally fervid. Said he: "Why do we make the sign



of the cross? We do it to commemorate the crucifixion of our



blessed Lord. What is commemorated at the crucifixion? The



sacrifice of his two natures--the divine and the human. How do we



make the sign? We make it with two fingers, thus"--accompanied by



a gesture. "What does this represent? It represents what really



occurred: the sacrifice of the divine and the human nature of our



Lord. How do the Orthodox make it?" Here his voice began to rise.



"They make it with three fingers"--and now his indignation burst



all bounds, and with a tremendous gesture and almost a scream of



wrath he declared: "and every time they make it they crucify



afresh every one of the three persons of the holy and undivided



Trinity."







The old man's voice, so gentle at first, had steadily risen



during this catechism of his, in which he propounded the



questions and recited the answers, until this last utterance came



with an outcry of horror. The beginning of this catechism was



given much after the manner of a boy reciting mechanically the



pons asinorum, but the end was like the testimony of an ancient



prophet against the sins which doomed Israel.







This last burst was evidently too much for Tolstoi. He said not a



word in reply, but seemed wrapped in overpowering thought, and



anxious to break away. We walked out with the old Raskolnik, and



at the door I thanked him for his kindness; but even there, and



all the way down the long walk through the park, Tolstoi remained



silent. As we came into the road he suddenly turned to me and



said almost fiercely, "That man is a hypocrite; he can't believe



that; he is a shrewd, long-headed man; how can he believe such



trash? Impossible!" At this I reminded him of Theodore Parker's



distinction between men who believe and men who "believe that



they believe," and said that possibly our Raskolnik was one of



the latter. This changed the subject. He said that he had read



Parker's biography, and liked it all save one thing, which was



that he gave a pistol to a fugitive slave and advised him to



defend himself. This Tolstoi condemned on the ground that we are



not to resist evil. I told him of the advice I had given to



Dobroluboff, a very winning Russian student at Cornell



University, when he was returning to Russia to practise his



profession as an engineer. That advice was that he should bear in



mind Buckle's idea as to the agency of railways and telegraphs in



extending better civilization, and devote himself to his



profession of engineering, with the certainty that its ultimate



result would be to aid in the enlightenment of the empire; but



never, on any account, to conspire against the government;



telling him that he might be sure that he could do far more for



the advancement of Russian thought by building railways than by



entering into any conspiracies whatever. Tolstoi said the advice



was good, but that he would also have advised the young man to



speak out his ideas, whatever they might be. He said that only in



this way could any advance ever be made; that one main obstacle



in human progress is the suppression of the real thoughts of men.



I answered that all this had a fine sound; that it might do for



Count Tolstoi; but that a young, scholarly engineer following it



would soon find himself in a place where he could not promulgate



his ideas,--guarded by Cossacks in some remote Siberian mine.







He spoke of young professors in the universities, of their



difficulties, and of the risk to their positions if they spoke



out at all. I asked him if there was any liberality or breadth of



thought in the Russo-Greek Church. He answered that occasionally



a priest had tried to unite broader thought with orthodox dogma,



but that every such attempt had proved futile.







From Parker we passed to Lowell, and I again tried to find if he



really knew anything of Lowell's writings. He evidently knew very



little, and asked me what Lowell had written. He then said that



he had no liking for verse, and he acquiesced in Carlyle's saying



that nobody had ever said anything in verse which could not have



been better said in prose.







A day or two later, on another of our walks, I asked him how and



when, in his opinion, a decided advance in Russian liberty and



civilization would be made. He answered that he thought it would



come soon, and with great power. On my expressing the opinion



that such progress would be the result of a long evolutionary



process, with a series of actions and reactions, as heretofore in



Russian history, he dissented, and said that the change for the



better would come soon, suddenly, and with great force.







As we passed along the streets he was, as during our previous



walks, approached by many beggars, to each of whom he gave as



long as his money lasted. He said that he was accustomed to take



a provision of copper money with him for this purpose on his



walks, since he regarded it as a duty to give when asked, and he



went on to say that he carried the idea so far that even if he



knew the man wanted the money to buy brandy he would give it to



him; but he added that he would do all in his power to induce the



man to work and to cease drinking. I demurred strongly to all



this, and extended the argument which I had made during our



previous walk, telling him that by such giving he did two wrongs:



first, to the beggar himself, since it led him to cringe and lie



in order to obtain as a favor that which, if he did his duty in



working, he could claim as a right; and, secondly, to society by



encouraging such a multitude to prey upon it who might be giving



it aid and strength; and I again called his attention to the



hordes of sturdy beggars in Moscow. He answered that the results



of our actions in such cases are not the main thing, but the



cultivation of proper feelings in the giver is first to be



considered.







I then asked him about his manual labor. He said that his habit



was to rise early and read or write until noon, then to take his



luncheon and a short sleep, and after that to work in his garden



or fields. He thought this good for him on every account, and



herein we fully agreed.







On our return through the Kremlin, passing the heaps and rows of



cannon taken from the French in 1812, I asked him if he still



adhered to the low opinion of Napoleon expressed in "War and



Peace." He said that he did, and more than ever since he had



recently read a book on Napoleon's relations to women which



showed that he took the lowest possible view of womankind. I then



asked him if he still denied Napoleon's military genius. He



answered that he certainly did; that he did not believe in the



existence of any such thing as military genius; that he had never



been able to understand what is meant by the term. I asked, "How



then do you account for the amazing series of Napoleon's



successes?" He answered, "By circumstances." I rejoined that such



an explanation had the merit, at least, of being short and easy.







He then went on to say that battles are won by force of



circumstances, by chance, by luck; and he quoted Suvaroff to this



effect. He liked Lanfrey's "History of Napoleon" and Taine's book



on the Empire, evidently because both are denunciatory of men and



things he dislikes, but said that he did not believe in Thiers.







We came finally under the shade of the great tower and into the



gateway through which Napoleon entered the Kremlin; and there we



parted with a hearty good-bye.







The question has been asked me, at various times since, whether,



in my opinion, Tolstoi is really sincere; and allusion has been



made to a book published by a lady who claims to have been in



close relations with his family, which would seem to reveal a



theatrical element in his whole life. To this my answer has



always been, and still is, that I believe him to be one of the



most sincere and devoted men alive, a man of great genius and, at



the same time, of very deep sympathy with his fellow-creatures.







Out of this character of his come his theories of art and



literature; and, despite their faults, they seem to me more



profound and far-reaching than any put forth by any other man in



our time.







There is in them, for the current cant regarding art and



literature, a sound, sturdy, hearty contempt which braces and



strengthens one who reads or listens to him. It does one good to



hear his quiet sarcasms against the whole fin-de-siecle



business--the "impressionism," the "sensationalism," the vague



futilities of every sort, the "great poets" wallowing in the mud



of Paris, the "great musicians" making night hideous in German



concert-halls, the "great painters" of various countries mixing



their colors with as much filth as the police will allow. His



keen thrusts at these incarnations of folly and obscenity in the



last quarter of the nineteenth century, and especially at those



who seek to hide the poverty of their ideas in the obscurity of



their phrases, encourage one to think that in the next generation



the day of such pretenders will be done. His prophesying against



"art for art's sake"; his denunciation of art which simply



ministers to sensual pleasure; his ridicule of art which can be



discerned only by "people of culture"; his love for art which has



a sense, not only of its power, but of its obligations, which



puts itself at the service of great and worthy ideas, which



appeals to men as men--in this he is one of the best teachers of



his time and of future times.







Yet here come in his unfortunate limitations. From his



substitutions of assertion for inference, and from the inadequacy



of his view regarding sundry growths in art, literature, and



science, arises endless confusion.







For who will not be skeptical as to the value of any criticism by



a man who pours contempt over the pictures of Puvis de Chavannes,



stigmatizes one of Beethoven's purest creations as "corrupting,"



and calls Shakspere a "scribbler"!







Nothing can be more genuine than his manner: there is no posing,



no orating, no phrase-making; a quiet earnestness pervades all



his utterances. The great defect in him arises, as I have already



said, from a peculiarity in the development of his opinions:



namely, that during so large a part of his life he has been wont



to discuss subjects with himself and not with other men; that he



has, therefore, come to worship idols of his own creation, and



often very unsubstantial idols, and to look with misgiving and



distrust on the ideas of others. Very rarely during our



conversations did I hear him speak with any real enthusiasm



regarding any human being: his nearest approach to it was with



reference to the writings of the Rev. Adin Ballou, when he



declared him the foremost literary character that America has



produced. A result of all this is that when he is driven into a



corner his logic becomes so subtle as to be imperceptible, and he



is very likely to take refuge in paradoxes.







At times, as we walked together, he would pour forth a stream of



reasoning so lucid, out of depths so profound and reach



conclusions so cogent, that he seemed fairly inspired. At other



times he would develop a line of argument so outworn, and arrive



at conclusions so inane, that I could not but look into his face



closely to see if he could be really in earnest; but it always



bore that same expression--forbidding the slightest suspicion



that he was uttering anything save that which he believed, at



least for the time being.







As to the moral side, the stream of his thought was usually



limpid, but at times it became turbid and his better ideas seemed



to float on the surface as iridescent bubbles.







Had he lived in any other country, he would have been a power



mighty and permanent in influencing its thought and in directing



its policy; as it is, his thought will pass mainly as the



confused, incoherent wail and cry of a giant struggling against



the heavy adverse currents in that vast ocean of Russian life:







          "The cry of some strong swimmer in his agony."











The evolution of Tolstoi's ideas has evidently been mainly



determined by his environment. During two centuries Russia has



been coming slowly out of the middle ages--indeed, out of perhaps



the most cruel phases of mediaeval life. Her history is, in its



details, discouraging; her daily life disheartening. Even the



aspects of nature are to the last degree depressing: no



mountains; no hills; no horizon; no variety in forests; a soil



during a large part of the year frozen or parched; a people whose



upper classes are mainly given up to pleasure and whose lower



classes are sunk in fetishism; all their poetry and music in the



minor key; old oppressions of every sort still lingering; no help



in sight; and, to use their own cry, "God so high and the Czar so



distant."







When, then, a great man arises in Russia, if he gives himself



wholly to some well-defined purpose, looking to one high aim and



rigidly excluding sight or thought of the ocean of sorrow about



him, he may do great things. If he be Suvaroff or Skobeleff or



Gourko he may win great battles; if he be Mendeleieff he may



reach some epoch-making discovery in science; if he be Derjavine



he may write a poem like the "Ode to God"; if he be Antokolsky he



may carve statues like "Ivan the Terrible"; if he be Nesselrode



he may hold all Europe enchained to the ideas of the autocrat; if



he be Miloutine or Samarine or Tcherkassky he may devise vast



plans like those which enabled Alexander II to free twenty



millions of serfs and to secure means of subsistence for each of



them; if he be Prince Khilkoff he may push railway systems over



Europe to the extremes of Asia; if he be De Witte he may reform a



vast financial system.







But when a strong genius in Russia throws himself into



philanthropic speculations of an abstract sort, with no chance of



discussing his theories until they are full-grown and have taken



fast hold upon him,--if he be a man of science like Prince



Kropotkin, one of the most gifted scientific thinkers of our



time,--the result may be a wild revolt, not only against the



whole system of his own country, but against civilization itself,



and finally the adoption of the theory and practice of anarchism,



which logically results in the destruction of the entire human



race. Or, if he be an accomplished statesman and theologian like



Pobedonostzeff, he may reason himself back into mediaeval



methods, and endeavor to fetter all free thought and to crush out



all forms of Christianity except the Russo-Greek creed and



ritual. Or, if he be a man of the highest genius in literature,



like Tolstoi, whose native kindliness holds him back from the



extremes of nihilism, he may rear a fabric heaven-high, in which



truths, errors, and paradoxes are piled up together until we have



a new Tower of Babel. Then we may see this man of genius



denouncing all science and commending what he calls "faith";



urging a return to a state of nature, which is simply Rousseau



modified by misreadings of the New Testament; repudiating



marriage, yet himself most happily married and the father of



sixteen children; holding that aeschylus and Dante and Shakspere



were not great in literature, and making Adin Ballou a literary



idol; holding that Michelangelo and Raphael were not great in



sculpture and painting, yet insisting on the greatness of sundry



unknown artists who have painted brutally; holding that



Beethoven, Handel, Mozart, Haydn, and Wagner were not great in



music, but that some unknown performer outside any healthful



musical evolution has given us the music of the future; declaring



Napoleon to have had no genius, but presenting Koutousoff as a



military ideal; loathing science--that organized knowledge which



has done more than all else to bring us out of mediaeval cruelty



into a better world--and extolling a "faith" which has always



been the most effective pretext for bloodshed and oppression.







The long, slow, every-day work of developing a better future for



his countrymen is to be done by others far less gifted than



Tolstoi. His paradoxes will be forgotten; but his devoted life,



his noble thoughts, and his lofty ideals will, as centuries roll



on, more and more give life and light to the new Russia.















CHAPTER XXXVIII







OFFICIAL LIFE IN ST. PETERSBURG-1892-1894







The difficulties of a stranger seeking information in Russia seem



at times insurmountable. First of these is the government policy



of suppressing news. Foreign journals come to ordinary



subscribers with paragraphs and articles rubbed out with pumice



or blotted out with ink; consequently our Russian friends were



wont to visit the legation, seeking to read in our papers what



had been erased in their own, and making the most amusing



discoveries as to the stupidity of the official censorship:



paragraphs perfectly harmless being frequently blotted out, and



really serious attacks on the government unnoticed.







Very striking, as showing control over the newspaper press, was



an occurrence during my first summer at Helsingfors. One day our



family doctor came in, and reported a rumor that an iron-clad



monitor had sunk, the night before, on its way across the gulf



from Reval. Soon the story was found to be true. A squadron of



three ships had started; had encountered a squall; and in the



morning one of them--an old-fashioned iron-clad monitor--was



nowhere to be seen. She had sunk with all on board. Considerable



speculation concerning the matter arose, and sundry very guarded



remarks were ventured to the effect that the authorities at



Cronstadt would have been wiser had they not allowed the ship to



go out in such a condition that the first squall would send her



to the bottom. This discussion continued for about a week, when



suddenly the proper authorities served notice upon the press that



nothing more must be said on the subject.







This mandate was obeyed; the matter was instantly dropped;



nothing more was said; and, a year or two afterward, on my



inquiring of Admiral Makharoff whether anything had ever been



discovered regarding the lost ship and its crew, he answered in



the negative.







But more serious efforts than these were made to control thought.



The censorship of books was even more strongly, and, if possible,



more foolishly, exercised. At any of the great bookshops one



could obtain, at once, the worst publications of the Paris press;



but the really substantial and thoughtful books were carefully



held back. The average Russian, in order to read most of these



better works, must be specially authorized to do so.







I had a practical opportunity to see the system in operation.



Being engaged on the final chapters of my book, and needing



sundry scientific, philosophical, and religious treatises, such



as can be bought freely in every city of Western Europe, I went



to the principal bookseller in St. Petersburg, and was told that,



by virtue of my diplomatic position, I could have them; but that,



in order to do so, I must write an application, signing it with



my own name, and that then he would sell them to me within a few



days. This took place several times.







Still another difficulty is that, owing to lack of publicity, the



truth can rarely be found as regards any burning question: in the



prevailing atmosphere of secrecy and repression the simplest



facts are often completely shut from the foreign observer.







Owing to the lack of public discussion, Russia is the classic



ground of myth and legend. One sees myths and legends growing day



by day. The legend regarding the cure of the Archbishop of St.



Petersburg by Father Ivan of Cronstadt, which I have given in a



previous chapter, is an example. The same growth of legend is



seen with regard to every-day matters. For example, one meets



half a dozen people at five-o'clock tea in a Russian house, and



one of them says: "How badly the Emperor looked at court last



night." Another says: "Yes; his liver is evidently out of order;



he ought to go to Carlsbad." Another says: "I think that special



pains ought to be taken with his food," etc., etc. People then



scatter from this tea-table, and in a day or two one hears that



sufficient precaution is not taken with the Emperor's food; that



it would not be strange if some nihilist should seek to poison



him. A day or two afterward one hears that a nihilist HAS



endeavored to poison the Emperor. The legend grows, details



appear here and there, and finally there come in the newspapers



of Western Europe full and careful particulars of a thwarted plot



to poison his Majesty.







Not the least of the embarrassments which beset an American



minister in Russia is one which arose at various times during my



stay, its source being the generous promptness of our people to



take as gospel any story regarding Russian infringement of human



rights. One or two cases will illustrate this.







During my second winter, despatches by mail and wire came to me



thick and fast regarding the alleged banishment of an American



citizen to Siberia for political reasons; and with these came



petitions and remonstrances signed by hundreds of Americans of



light and leading; also newspaper articles, many and bitter.







On making inquiries through the Russian departments of foreign



affairs and of justice, I found the fact to be that this injured



American had been, twenty years before, a Russian police agent in



Poland; that he had stolen funds intrusted to him and had taken



refuge in America; that, relying on the amnesty proclaimed at the



accession of the late Emperor, he had returned to his old haunts;



that he had been seized, because the amnesty did not apply to the



category of criminals to which he belonged; that he had not been



sent to Siberia; that there was no thought of sending him there;



but that the authorities proposed to recover the money he had



stolen if they could. Another case was typical: One day an



excellent English clergyman came to me in great distress, stating



that an American citizen was imprisoned in the city. I



immediately had the man brought before a justice, heard his



testimony and questioned him, publicly and privately. He swore



before the court, and insisted to me in private, that he had



never before been in Russia; that he was an American citizen born



of a Swedish father and an Alaskan mother upon one of the Alaskan



islands; and he showed a passport which he had obtained at



Washington by making oath to that effect. On the other hand



appeared certain officers of the Russian navy, in excellent



standing, who swore that they knew the man perfectly to be a



former employee of their engineering department and a deserter



from a Russian ship of war in the port of St. Petersburg. It was



also a somewhat significant fact that he spoke Russian much



better than English, and that he seemed to have a knowledge of



Russian affairs very remarkable for a man who had never been in



Russia; but to account for this he insisted upon the statement as



to his birth in Alaska. Appearances were certainly very strongly



against him, and he was remanded to await more testimony in his



favor; but the next thing I heard was that he had escaped, had



arrived in New York, was posing as a martyr, had graciously



granted interviews to various representatives of the press, and



had thereby stimulated some very lurid editorials against the



Russian Government.







Another case was that of a Russian who, having reached the United



States, burdened the files of the State Department and of the



legation with complaints against the American minister because



that official did not send out the man's wife to him. The



minister had, indeed, forwarded the necessary passports, but the



difficulty was that the German authorities would not allow the



woman to enter Germany without showing herself to be in



possession of means sufficient to prevent her becoming a public



charge; and these her husband could not, or would not, send,



insisting that now that he was naturalized he had a right to have



his wife brought to America.







I have no apology to make for the Russian system--far from it;



but I would state, in the interest of international comity, that



it is best for Americans not to be too prompt in believing all



the stories of alleged sufferers from Russian despotism, and



especially of those who wish to use their American citizenship



simply in order to return to Russia and enjoy business advantages



superior to those of their neighbors.







That there are many meritorious refugees cannot be denied; but



any one who has looked over extradition papers, as I have been



obliged to do, and seen people posing as Russian martyrs who are



comfortably carrying on in New York the business of



counterfeiting bank-notes, and unctuously thanking God in their



letters for their success in the business, will be slow to join



in the outcries of refugees of doubtful standing claiming to be



suffering persecution on account of race, religion, or political



opinion.







Nor are Russian-Americans the only persons who weary an American



representative. One morning a card was brought in bearing an



undoubted American name, and presently there followed it a tall



raw-boned man with long flaxen hair, who began orating to me as



follows: "Sir, you are an ambassador from the President of the



United States; I am an ambassador from God Almighty. I am sent



here to save the Emperor. He is a good man; he is followed up by



bad men who seek his life; I can save him; I will be his



cup-bearer; I WILL DRIVE HIS TEAM." This latter conception of the



Emperor's means of locomotion struck me as naive, especially in



view of the fact that near my house was an immense structure



filled with magnificent horses for the Emperor and court--a



veritable equine palace. "Yes," said my visitor; "I will drive



the Emperor's team. I want you to introduce me to him



immediately." My answer was that it was not so easy to secure a



presentation to the Emperor, offhand; that considerable time



would be necessary in any case. To this my visitor answered: "I



must see him at once; I am invited to come by the Empress." On my



asking when he received this invitation, he said that it was



given him on board the steamer between New York and Hamburg, her



Majesty and her children being the only other passengers besides



himself in the second-class cabin. To this I said that there must



certainly be some mistake; that her Majesty rarely, if ever,



traveled on public lines of steamers; that if she had done so,



she certainly would not have been a passenger in the second



cabin. To this he answered that he was absolutely certain that it



was the Empress who had given him the invitation and urged him to



come and save the Emperor's life. On my asking him the date of



this invitation, he looked through his diary and found it. At



this, sending for a file of the official newspaper of St.



Petersburg, I showed him that on the day named her Majesty was



receiving certain officials at the palace in St. Petersburg;



whereat he made an answer which for the moment threw me



completely off my balance. He said, "Sir, I have lived long



enough not to believe everything I see in the newspapers."







I quieted him as best I could, but on returning to his hotel he



indulged in some very boisterous conduct, one of the minor



features of which was throwing water in the faces of the waiters;



so that, fearing lest actions like this and his loud utterances



regarding the Emperor and Empress might get him into trouble, I



wrote a friendly letter to the prefect of St. Petersburg, stating



the case, and asking that, if it was thought best to arrest the



man, he should be placed in some comfortable retreat for the



insane and be well cared for until I could communicate with his



friends in America. Accordingly, a day or two afterward, a



handsome carriage drove up to the door of his hotel, bearing two



kindly gentlemen, who invited him to accompany them. Taking it



for granted that he was to be escorted to the palace to meet his



Majesty, he went without making any objections, and soon found



himself in commodious rooms and most kindly treated.







It being discovered that he was an excellent pianist, a grand



piano was supplied him; and he was very happy in his musical



practice, and in the thought that he was lodged in the palace and



would soon communicate his message to the Emperor. At various



times I called upon him and found him convinced that his great



mission would soon be accomplished; but after a week or ten days



he began to have doubts, and said to me that he distrusted the



Russians and would prefer to go on and deliver a message with



which he was charged to the Emperor of China. On my showing him



sundry difficulties, he said that at any rate there was one place



where he would certainly be well received--Marlborough House in



London; that he was sure the Prince of Wales would welcome him



heartily. At last, means having been obtained from his friends, I



sought to forward him from St. Petersburg; but, as no steamers



thence would take a lunatic, I sent my private secretary with him



to Helsingfors, and thence secured his passage to America.







A very curious feature in the case, as told me afterward by a



gentleman who traveled in the same steamer, was that this



American delighted the company day after day with his music, and



that no one ever saw anything out of the way in his utterances or



conduct. He seemed to have forgotten all about his great missions



and to have become absorbed in his piano.







Among the things to which special and continued attention had to



be given by the legation was the Chicago Exposition. I was



naturally desirous to see it a success; indeed, it was my duty to



do everything possible to promote it. The magnificent plans which



the Chicago people had developed and were carrying out with such



wonderful energy interested thinking Russians. But presently came



endeavors which might easily have brought the whole enterprise



into disrepute; for some of the crankish persons who always hang



on the skirts of such enterprises had been allowed to use



official stationery, and they had begun writing letters, and even



instructions, to American diplomatic agents abroad.







The first of these which attracted my attention was one



requesting me to ask the Empress to write a book in the shape of



a "Report on Women's Work in Russia," careful instructions being



given as to how and at what length she must write it.







A letter also came from one of these quasi-officials at Chicago,



not requesting, but instructing, me to ask the Emperor to report



to his bureau on the condition of the empire; funnily enough,



this "instruction" was evidently one of several, and they had



been ground out so carelessly that the one which I was instructed



to deliver to the Emperor was addressed to the "King of Holland."



It was thus made clear that this important personage at Chicago,



who usurped the functions of the Secretary of State, had not even



taken the trouble to find out that there was no such person as a



"King of Holland," the personage whom he vaguely had in mind



being, no doubt, the Queen Regent of the Netherlands.







Soon there followed another of these quasi-instructions, showing



another type of crankishness. Beginning with the weighty



statement that "the school-boys of every country are the future



men of that country," it went on with a declaration that it had



been decided to hold a convention of the school-children of the



world at Chicago, in connection with the Exposition, and ended by



instructing me to invite to its deliberations the school-children



of Russia. Of course I took especial care not to communicate any



of these things to any Russian: to have done so would have made



the Exposition, instead of the admiration, the laughing-stock of



the empire; but I wrote a letter to the assistant secretary of



state, Mr. Quincy, who presently put an end to these vagaries.







One is greatly struck in Russia by the number of able and gifted



men and women scattered through Russian society, and at the



remarkable originality of some of them. The causes of this



originality I touch in my chapter on Tolstoi.







It was a duty as well as a pleasure for me to keep up my



acquaintance with persons worth knowing; and, while many of the



visits thus made were perfunctory and tedious, some were



especially gratifying. My rule was, after office hours in the



afternoon, to get into the open sledge; to make my visits; and as



a result, of course, to see and hear a vast deal of frivolity and



futility, but, from time to time, more important things.







The entertainments given by wealthy Russian nobles to the



diplomatic corps were by no means so frequent or so lavish as of



old. Two reasons were assigned for this, one being the abolition



of the serf system, which had impoverished the nobility, and the



other the fact that the Emperor Alexander III had set the fashion



of paying less attention to foreigners than had formerly been the



custom.







The main hospitalities, so far as the Emperor and Empress were



concerned, were the great festivities at the Winter Palace,



beginning on the Russian New Year's day, which was twelve days



later than ours. The scene was most brilliant. The vast halls



were filled with civil and military officials from all parts of



the empire, in the most gorgeous costumes, an especially striking



effect being produced by the caftans, or long coats, of the



various Cossack regiments, the armor and helmets of the Imperial



Guards, and the old Russian costumes of the ladies. All of the



latter, on this occasion, from the Empress down, wore these



costumes: there was great variety in these; but their main



features were the kakoshniks, or ornamental crowns, and the



tunics in bright colors.







The next of these great ceremonies at the Winter Palace was the



blessing of the waters upon the 8th of January. The diplomatic



corps and other guests were allowed to take their places at the



palace windows looking out over the Neva, and thence could see



the entire procession, which, having gone down the ambassadors'



staircase, appeared at a temple which had been erected over an



opening in the ice of the river. The Emperor, the grand dukes,



and the Archbishop of St. Petersburg, with his suffragan bishops,



all took part in this ceremonial; and the music, which was



selected from the anthems of Bortniansky, was very solemn and



impressive.







During the winter came court balls, and, above all, the "palm



balls." The latter were, in point of brilliancy, probably beyond



anything in any court of modern times. After a reception, during



which the Emperor and Empress passed along the diplomatic circle,



speaking to the various members, dancing began, and was continued



until about midnight; then the doors were flung open into other



vast halls, which had been changed into palm-groves. The palms



for this purpose are very large and beautiful, four series of



them being kept in the conservatories for this special purpose,



each series being used one winter and then allowed to rest for



three winters before it is brought out again. Under these palms



the supper-tables are placed, and from fifteen hundred to two



thousand people sit at these as the guests of the Czar and



Czarina. These entertainments seem carried to the extreme of



luxury, their only defect being their splendid monotony: only



civil, military, and diplomatic officials are present, and a



new-comer finds much difficulty in remembering their names. There



are said to be four hundred Princes Galitzin in the empire, and I



personally knew three Counts Tolstoi who did not know each other;



but the great drawback is the fact that all these entertainments



are exactly alike, always the same thing: merely civil and



military functionaries and their families; and for strangers no



occupation save to dance, play cards, talk futilities, or simply



stare.







The Berlin court, though by no means so brilliant at first sight



and far smaller,--since the most I ever saw in any gathering in



the Imperial Schloss at the German capital was about fifteen



hundred,--was really much more attractive, its greater interest



arising from the presence of persons distinguished in every



field. While at St. Petersburg one meets only civil and military



functionaries, at Berlin one meets not only these, but the most



prominent men in politics, science, literature, art, and the



higher ranges of agriculture, commerce, and manufacture. At St.



Petersburg, when I wished to meet such men, who added to the



peaceful glories of the empire, I went to their houses in the



university quarter; at Berlin I met them also at court.







As to court episodes during my stay, one especially dwells in my



memory. On arriving rather early one evening, I noticed a large,



portly man, wearing the broad red ribbon of the Legion of Honor,



and at once saw that he could be no other than Prince Victor



Napoleon, the Bonaparte heir to the crown of France. Though he



was far larger than the great Napoleon, and had the eyes of his



mother, Princess Clothilde, his likeness to his father, Prince



Napoleon ("Plon-Plon"), whom I had seen years before at Paris,



was very marked. Presently his brother, who had just arrived from



his regiment in the Caucasus, came up and began conversation with



him. Both seemed greatly vexed at something. On the arrival of



the Italian ambassador, he naturally went up and spoke to the



prince, who was the grandson of King Victor Emmanuel; but the



curious thing was that the French ambassador, Count de



Montebello, and the prince absolutely cut each other. Neither



seemed to have the remotest idea that the other was in the room,



and this in spite of the fact that the Montebellos are descended



from Jean Lannes, the stable-boy whom Napoleon made a marshal of



France and Duke of Montebello, thus founding the family to which



the French ambassador belonged. The show of coolness on the part



of the imperial family evidently vexed the French pretender. He



was, indeed, allowed to enter the room behind the imperial train;



but he was not permitted to sit at the imperial table, being



relegated to a distant and very modest seat. I was informed that,



though the Emperor could, and did, have the prince to dine with



him in private, he felt obliged, in view of the relations between



Russia and the French Republic, to carefully avoid any special



recognition of him in public.







A far more brilliant visitor was the Ameer of Bokhara. I have



already spoken of the way in which he was placed upon the throne



by General Annenkof. He now came to visit the Czar as his



suzerain, and with him came his eldest son and a number of his



great men. The satrap himself was a singular combination of



splendor and stoicism, wearing a gorgeous dress covered with



enormous jewels, and observing the brilliant scenes about him



with hardly ever a word. Even when he took his place at the table



beside the Empress he was very uncommunicative. Facing the



imperial table sat his great men; and their embarrassment was



evident, one special source of it being clearly their small



acquaintance with European table utensils. The Ameer brought to



St. Petersburg splendid presents of gold and jewels, after the



Oriental fashion, and also the heir to his throne, whom he left



as a sort of hostage to be educated at the capital.







An eminent Russian who was in very close relations with the Ameer



gave me some account of this young man. Although he was then



perhaps fourteen or fifteen years of age, he was, as regards



conduct, a mere baby, bursting out into loud boohooing the first



time he was presented to the Emperor, and showing himself very



immature in various ways. Curiously enough, when he was taken to



the cadet school he was found to be unable to walk for any



considerable distance. He had always been made to squat and be



carried, and the first thing to be done toward making him a



Russian officer was to train him in using his legs. He took an



especial fancy to bicycles: in the park attached to the cadet



school he became very proficient in the use of them; and,



returning to Bokhara at his first vacation, he took with him, not



only a bicycle for himself, but another for his brother. Shortly



after his home-coming, the Ameer and court being assembled, he



gave a display of his powers; but, to his great mortification,



the Ameer was disgusted: the idea that the heir to the throne



should be seen working his way in this fashion was contrary to



all the ideas of that potentate, and he ordered the bicycles to



be at once destroyed. But on the young man's return to St.



Petersburg he bought another; resumed his exercises upon it; and



will, no doubt, when he comes to the throne, introduce that form



of locomotion into the Mohammedan regions of Northern Asia.







Among the greater displays of my final year were a wedding and a



funeral. The former was that of the Emperor's eldest daughter,



the Grand Duchess Xenia, at Peterhof. It was very brilliant, and



was conducted after the usual Russian fashion, its most curious



features being the leading of the couple about the altar and



their drinking out of the same cup.







Coming from the ceremony in the chapel, we of the diplomatic



corps found ourselves, at the foot of the great staircase, in a



crush. But just at the side was a large door of plate-glass



opening upon an outer gallery communicating with other parts of



the palace; and standing guard at this door was one of the



"Nubians" whom I had noticed, from time to time, at the Winter



Palace--an enormous creature, very black, very glossy, with the



most brilliant costume possible. I had heard much of these



"Nubians," and had been given to understand that they had been



brought from Central Africa by special command. At great



assemblages in the imperial palaces, just before the doors were



flung open for the entrance of the Majesties and their cortege,



two great black hands were always to be seen put through the



doors, ready to open them in an instant--the hands of two of



these "Nubians." I had built up in my mind quite a structure of



romance regarding them, and now found myself in the crush at the



foot of the grand staircase near one of them. As I looked up at



him he said to me, with deferential compassion, "If you please,



sah, would n't you like to git out of de crowd, sah, through dis



yere doah?" By his dialect he was evidently one of my own



compatriots, and, though in a sort of daze at this discovery, I



mechanically accepted his invitation; whereupon he opened the



door, let us through, and kept back the crowd.







Splendid, too, in its way, was the funeral of the Grand Duchess



Catherine at the Fortress Church. It was very impressive, almost



as much so as the funeral of the Emperor Nicholas, which I had



attended at the same place nearly forty years before. The Emperor



Alexander III, with his brothers, had followed the hearse and



coffin on foot, and his Majesty was evidently greatly fatigued.



Soon he retired to take rest, and then it was that we began to



have the first suspicion of his fatal illness. Up to that time



there had been skepticism. Very few had thought it possible that



a man of such giant frame and strength could be seriously ill,



but now there could be no doubt of it. Standing near him, I



noticed his pallor and evident fatigue, and was not surprised



that he twice left the place, in order, evidently, to secure



rest. There was need of it. In the Russian Church the rule is



that all must stand, and all of us stood from about ten in the



morning until half-past one in the afternoon; but two high



officials covered with gold lace and orders, bearing tapers by



the side of the grand duchess's coffin, toppled over from



exhaustion and were removed.







As to other spectacles, one of the most splendid was the midnight



mass on Easter eve. At my former visit I had seen this at the



Kazan Church; now we went to the Cathedral of St. Isaac. The



ceremony was brilliant almost beyond conception, as in the old



days; the music was heavenly; and, as the clocks struck twelve,



the cannons of the fortress of Peter and Paul boomed forth, all



the bells of the city began chiming, and a light, appearing at



the extreme end of the church, seemed to run in all directions



through the vast assemblage, and presently all seemed ablaze.



Every person in the church was holding a taper, and within a few



moments all of these had been lighted.







Most beautiful of all was the music at another of these Easter



ceremonies, when the choristers, robed in white, came forth from



the sanctuary and sang hymns by the side of the empty sepulcher



under the dome.







The singing by the choirs in Russia is, in many respects, more



beautiful than similar music in any other part of the world, save



that of the cathedral choir of Berlin at its best. I have heard



the Sistine, Pauline, and Lateran choirs at Rome; and they are



certainly far inferior to these Russian singers. No instrumental



music is allowed and no voices of women. The choristers are men



and boys. There are several fine choirs in St. Petersburg, but



three are famous: that of the Emperor at the Winter Palace



Chapel, that of the Archbishop at the Cathedral of St. Isaac, and



that of the Nevski Monastery. Occasionally there were concerts



when all were combined, and nothing in its way could be more



perfect.







Operatic music also receives careful attention. Enormous



subsidies are given to secure the principal singers of Europe at



the Italian, French, and German theaters; but the most lavish



outlay is upon the national opera: it is considered a matter of



patriotism to maintain it at the highest point possible. The



Russian Opera House is an enormous structure, and the finest



piece which I saw given there was Glinka's "Life for the Czar."



Being written by a Russian, on a patriotic subject, and from an



ultra-loyal point of view, everything had been done to mount it



in the most superb way possible: never have I seen more wonderful



scenic effects, the whole culminating in the return of one of the



old fighting czars to the Kremlin after his struggle with the



Poles. The stage was enormous and the procession magnificent. The



personages in it were the counterparts, as regarded dress, of the



persons they represented, exact copies having been made of the



robes and ornaments of the old Muscovite boyards, as preserved in



the Kremlin Museum; and at the close of this procession came a



long line of horses, in the most superb trappings imaginable,



attended by guards and outriders in liveries of barbaric



splendor, and finally the imperial coach. We were enabled to



catch sight of the Cossack guards on the front of it, when, just



as the body of the coach was coming into view, down came the



curtain. This was the result of a curious prohibition, enforced



in all theaters in Russia: on no account is it permitted to



represent the sacred person of any emperor upon the stage.







As to other music, very good concerts were occasionally given,



the musicians being generally from Western Europe.







Very pleasant were sundry excursions, especially during the long



summer twilight; and among these were serenade parties given by



various members of the diplomatic corps. In a trim steam-yacht,



and carrying singers with us, we sailed among the islands in the



midnight hours, stopping, from time to time, to greet friends



occupying cottages there.







As to excursions in the empire, I have already given, in my



chapter on Tolstoi, some account of my second visit to Moscow;



and a more complete account is reserved for a chapter on "Sundry



Excursions and Experiences." The same may be said, also,



regarding an excursion taken, during one of my vacations, in



Sweden, Norway, and Denmark.







In 1893, a new administration having brought into power the party



opposed to my own, I tendered to President Cleveland my



resignation, and, in the full expectation that it would be



accepted, gave up my apartment; but as, instead of an acceptance,



there came a very kind indication of the President's confidence,



good-will, and preference for my continuance at my post, I



remained in the service a year longer, occupying my odds and ends



of time in finishing my book. Then, feeling the need of going



elsewhere to revise it, I wrote the President, thanking him for



his confidence and kindness, but making my resignation final, and



naming the date when it would be absolutely necessary for me to



leave Russia. A very kind letter from him was the result; the



time I had named was accepted; and on the 1st of November, 1894,



to my especial satisfaction, I was once more free from official



duty.















CHAPTER XXXIX







AS MEMBER OF THE VENEZUELA COMMISSION--1895-1896







Early one morning, just at the end of 1895, as I was at work



before the blazing fire in my library at the university, the



winter storms howling outside, a card was brought in bearing the



name of Mr. Hamlin, assistant secretary of the treasury of the



United States. While I was wondering what, at that time of the



year, could have brought a man from such important duties in



Washington to the bleak hills of central New York, he entered,



and soon made known his business, which was to tender me, on the



part of President Cleveland, a position upon the commission which



had been authorized by Congress to settle the boundary between



the republic of Venezuela and British Guiana.







The whole matter had attracted great attention, not only in the



United States, but throughout the world. The appointment of the



commission was the result of a chain of circumstances very



honorable to the President, to his Secretary of State, Mr. Olney,



and to Congress. For years the Venezuelan government had been



endeavoring to establish a frontier between its territory and



that of its powerful neighbor, but without result; and meantime



the British boundary seemed to be pushed more and more into the



territory of the little Spanish-American republic. For years,



too, Venezuela had appealed to the United States, and the United



States had appealed to Great Britain. American secretaries of



state and ambassadors at the Court of St. James had "trusted,"



and "regretted," and had "the honor to renew assurances of their



most distinguished consideration"; but all in vain. At last the



matter had been presented by Secretary Olney to the government of



Lord Salisbury; and now, to Mr. Olney's main despatch on the



subject, Lord Salisbury, after some months' delay, had returned



an answer declining arbitration, and adding that international



law did not recognize the Monroe Doctrine. This seemed even more



than cool; for, when one remembered that the Monroe Doctrine was



at first laid down with the approval of Great Britain, that it



was glorified in Parliament and in the British press of 1823 and



the years following, and that Great Britain had laid down



policies in various parts of the earth, especially in the



Mediterranean and in the far East, which she insisted that all



other powers should respect without reference to any sanction by



international law, this argument seemed almost insulting.







So it evidently seemed to Mr. Cleveland. Probably no man less



inclined to demagogism or to a policy of adventure ever existed;



but as he looked over the case his American instincts were



evidently aroused. He saw then, what is clear to everybody now,



that it was the time of all times for laying down, distinctly and



decisively, the American doctrine on the subject. He did so, and



in a message to Congress proposed that, since Great Britain would



not intrust the finding of a boundary to arbitration, the United



States should appoint commissioners to find what the proper



boundary was, and then, having ascertained it, should support its



sister American republic in maintaining it.







Of course the President was attacked from all sides most



bitterly; even those called "the better element" in the



Republican and Democratic parties, who had been his ardent



supporters, now became his bitter enemies. He was charged with



"demagogism" and "jingoism," but he kept sturdily on. Congress,



including the great body of the Republicans, supported him; the



people at large stood by him; and, as a result, a commission to



determine the boundary was appointed and began its work in



Washington, the commissioners being, in the order named by the



President, David J. Brewer of Kansas, a justice of the Supreme



Court of the United States; Chief Justice Alvey of the District



of Columbia; Andrew D. White of New York; F. R. Coudert, an



eminent member of the New York bar; and Daniel C. Gilman of



Maryland, President of Johns Hopkins University.







On our arrival in Washington there was much discouragement among



us. We found ourselves in a jungle of geographical and legal



questions, with no clue in sight leading anywhither. The rights



of Great Britain had been derived in 1815, from the Netherlands;



the rights of Venezuela had been derived, about 1820, from Spain;



but to find the boundary separating the two in that vast



territory, mainly unsettled, between the Orinoco and the



Essequibo rivers, seemed impossible.







The original rights of the Netherlands had been derived from



Spain by the treaty of Munster in 1648; and on examining that



enormous document, which settled weighty questions in various



parts of the world, after the life-and-death struggle, religious,



political, and military, which had gone on for nearly eighty



years, one little clause arrested our attention: that, namely, in



which the Spaniards, despite their bitter hatred of the Dutch,



agreed that the latter might carry on warlike operations against



"certain other people" with reference to territorial rights in



America. These "certain other people" were not precisely



indicated; and we hoped, by finding who they were, to get a clue



to the fundamental facts of the case. Straightway two of our



three lawyers, Mr. Justice Brewer and Mr. Coudert, grappled on



this question, one of them taking the ground that these "other



people" referred to were the Caribbean Indians who had lived just



south of the mouth of the Orinoco, and had been friendly to the



Dutch but implacable toward the Spaniards, and that their



territory was to be considered as virtually Dutch, and,



therefore, as having passed finally to England. But the other



disputant insisted that it referred to the Brazilians and had no



relation to the question with which we had to deal. During two



whole sessions this ground was fought over in a legal way by



these gentlemen, with great acumen, the rest of us hardly putting



in a word.







At the beginning of the third session I ventured a remonstrance,



saying that it was a historical, and not a legal, question; that



it could not possibly be settled by legal argument; that the



first thing to know was why the clause was inserted in the



treaty, and that the next thing was to find, from the whole



history leading up to it, who those "other persons" thus vaguely



referred to and left by the Spaniards to the tender mercies of



the Dutch might be; and I insisted that this, being a historical



question, must be solved by historical experts. The commission



acknowledged the justice of this; and on my nomination we called



to our aid Mr. George Lincoln Burr, professor of history in



Cornell University. It is not at all the very close friendship



which has existed for so many years between us which prompts the



assertion that, of all historical scholars I have ever known, he



is among the very foremost, by his powers of research, his



tenacity of memory, his almost preternatural accuracy, his



ability to keep the whole field of investigation in his mind, and



his fidelity to truth and justice. He was set at the problem, and



given access to the libraries of Congress and of the State



Department, as also to the large collections of books and maps



which had been placed at the disposal of the commission. Of these



the most important were those of Harvard University and the



University of Wisconsin. Curious as it may seem, this latter



institution, far in the interior of our country, possesses a



large and most valuable collection of maps relating to the



colonization history of South America. Within two weeks Professor



Burr reported, and never did a report give more satisfaction. He



had unraveled, historically, the whole mystery, and found that,



the government of Brazil having played false to both Spaniards



and Dutch, Spain had allowed the Netherlands to take vengeance



for the vexations of both. We also had the exceedingly valuable



services, as to maps and early colonization history, of Mr.



Justin Winsor, librarian of Harvard University, eminent both as



historian and geographer, and of Professor Jameson of Brown



University, who had also distinguished himself in these fields.



Besides these, Mr. Marcus Baker of the United States Coast Survey



aided us, from day to day, in mapping out any territories that we



wished especially to study.







All this work was indispensable. At the very beginning of our



sessions there had been laid before us the first of a series of



British Blue Books on the whole subject; and, with all my



admiration for the better things in British history, politics,



and life, candor compels me to say that it was anything but



creditable to the men immediately responsible for it. It made



several statements that were absolutely baseless, and sought to



rest them upon authorities which, when examined, were found not



to bear in the slightest degree the interpretation put upon them.



I must confess that nothing, save, perhaps, the conduct of



British "experts" regarding the Behring Sea question, has ever



come so near shaking my faith in "British fair play." Nor were



the American commissioners alone in judging this document



severely. Critics broke forth, even in the London "Times,"



denouncing it, until it was supplanted by another, which was fair



and just.







I, of course, impute nothing to the leading British statesmen who



had charge of the whole Venezuelan question. The culprits were,



undoubtedly, sundry underlings whose zeal outran their honesty.



They apparently thought that in the United States, which they



probably considered as new, raw, and too much engaged in



dollar-hunting to produce scholars, their citations from



authorities more or less difficult of access would fail to be



critically examined. But their conduct was soon exposed, and even



their principals joined in repudiating some of their fundamental



statements. Professor Burr was sent abroad, and at The Hague was



able to draw treasures from the library and archives regarding



the old Dutch occupation and to send a mass of important material



for our deliberations. In London also he soon showed his



qualities, and these were acknowledged even by some leading



British geographers. The latter had at first seemed inclined to



indulge in what a German might call "tendency" geography; but the



clearness, earnestness, and honesty of our agent soon gained



their respect, and, after that, the investigators of both sides



worked harmoniously together. While the distinguished lawyers



above named had main charge of the legal questions, President



Gilman, who had in his early life been professor of physical and



general geography at Yale, was given charge of the whole matter



of map-seeking and -making; and to me, with the others, was left



the duty of studying and reporting upon the material as brought



in. Taking up my residence at Washington, I applied myself



earnestly to reading through masses of books, correspondence, and



other documents, and studied maps until I felt as if I had lived



in the country concerned and was personally acquainted with the



Dutch governors on the Cuyuni and the Spanish monks on the



Orinoco. As a result lines more or less tentative were prepared



by each of us, Judge Brewer and myself agreeing very closely, and



the others not being very distant from us at any important point.



One former prime minister of Great Britain I learned, during this



investigation, to respect greatly,--Lord Aberdeen, whom I well



remembered as discredited and driven from power during my stay in



Russia at the time of the Crimean War. He was wise enough in



those days to disbelieve in war with Russia, and to desire a



solution of the Turkish problem by peace, but was overruled, and



the solution was attempted by a war most costly in blood and



treasure, which was apparently successful, but really a failure.



He was driven from his post with ignominy; and I well remembered



seeing a very successful cartoon in "Punch" at that period,



representing him, wearing coronet and mantle and fast asleep, at



the helm of the ship of state, which was rolling in the trough of



the sea and apparently about to founder.







Since that time his wisdom has, I think, been recognized; and I



am now glad to acknowledge the fact that, of all the many British



statesmen who dealt with the Venezuelan question, he was clearly



the most just. The line he drew seemed to me the fairest



possible. He did not attempt to grasp the mouth of the Orinoco,



nor did he meander about choice gold-fields or valuable strategic



points, seeking to include them. The Venezuelans themselves had



shown willingness to accept his proposal; but alleged, as their



reason for not doing so, that the British government had preached



to them regarding their internal policy so offensively that



self-respect forbade them to acquiesce in any part of it.







Toward this Aberdeen line we tended more and more; and in the



sequel we heard, with very great satisfaction, that the



Arbitration Tribunal at Paris had practically adopted this line,



which we of the commission had virtually agreed upon. It need



hardly be stated that, each side having at the beginning of the



arbitration claimed the whole vast territory between the Orinoco



and the Essequibo, neither was quite satisfied with the award.



But I believe it to be thoroughly just, and that it forms a most



striking testimony to the value of international arbitration in



such questions, as a means, not only of preserving international



peace, but of arriving at substantial justice.







Our deliberations and conclusions were, of course, kept secret.



It was of the utmost importance that nothing should get out



regarding them. Our sessions were delayed and greatly prolonged,



partly on account of the amount of work to be done in studying



the many questions involved, and partly because we hoped that,



more and more, British opinion would tend to the submission of



the whole question to the judgment of a proper international



tribunal; and that Lord Salisbury, the prime minister, who, in



his rather cynical, "Saturday-Review," high-Tory way, had scouted



the idea of arbitration, would at last be brought to it. Of



course, every thinking Englishman looked with uneasiness toward



the possibility that a line might be laid down by the United



States which it would feel obliged to maintain, and which would



necessitate its supporting Venezuela, at all hazards, against



Great Britain.







The statesmanship of Mr. Cleveland and Mr. Olney finally



triumphed. Most fortunately for both parties, Great Britain had



at Washington a most eminent diplomatist, whose acquaintance I



then made, but whom I afterward came to know, respect, and admire



even more during the Peace Conference at The Hague--Sir Julian,



afterward Lord, Pauncefote. His wise counsels prevailed; Lord



Salisbury receded from his position; Great Britain agreed to



arbitration; and the question entered into a new stage, which was



finally ended by the award of the Arbitration Tribunal at Paris,



presided over by M. de Martens of St. Petersburg, and having on



its bench the chief justices of the two nations and two of the



most eminent judges of their highest courts. It is with pride and



satisfaction that I find their award agreeing, substantially,



with the line which, after so much trouble, our own commission



had worked out. Arbitration having been decided upon, our



commission refrained from laying down a frontier-line, but



reported a mass of material, some fourteen volumes in all, with



an atlas containing about seventy-five maps, all of which formed



a most valuable contribution to the material laid before the



Court of Arbitration at Paris.







It was a happy solution of the whole question, and it was a



triumph of American diplomacy in the cause of right and justice.







I may mention, in passing, one little matter which throws light



upon a certain disgraceful system to which I have had occasion to



refer at various other times in these memoirs; and I do so now in



the hope of keeping people thinking upon one of the most wretched



abuses in the United States. I have said above that we were, of



course, obliged to maintain the strictest secrecy. To have



allowed our conclusions to get out would have thwarted the whole



purpose of the investigation; but a person who claimed to



represent one of the leading presses in Washington seemed to



think that consideration of no special importance, and came to



our rooms, virtually insisting on receiving information. Having



been told that it could not be given him, he took his revenge by



inserting a sensational paragraph in the papers regarding the



extravagance of the commission. He informed the world that we



were expending large sums of public money in costly furniture, in



rich carpets, and especially in splendid silverware. The fact was



that the rooms were furnished very simply, with plain office



furniture, with cheap carpets, and with a safe for locking up the



more precious documents intrusted to us and such papers as it was



important to keep secret. The "silverware" consisted of two very



plain plated jugs for ice-water; and I may add that after our



adjournment the furniture was so wisely sold that very nearly the



whole expenditure for it was returned into the treasury.







These details would be utterly trivial were it not that, with



others which I have given in other places, they indicate that



prostitution of the press to sensation-mongering which the



American people should realize and reprove.







While I have not gone into minor details of our work, I have



thought that thus much might be interesting. Of course, had these



reminiscences been written earlier, this sketch of the interior



history of the commission would have been omitted; but now, the



award of the Paris tribunal having been made, there is no reason



why secrecy should be longer maintained. Never, before that



award, did any of us, I am sure, indicate to any person what our



view as to the line between the possessions of Venezuela and



Great Britain was; but now we may do so, and I feel that all



concerned may be congratulated on the fact that two tribunals,



each seeking to do justice, united on the same line, and that



line virtually the same which one of the most just of British



statesmen had approved many years before.







During this Venezuela work in Washington I made acquaintance with



many leading men in politics; and among those who interested me



most was Mr. Carlisle of Kentucky, Secretary of the Treasury. He



had been member of Congress, Speaker of the House of



Representatives, and senator, and was justly respected and



admired. Perhaps the most peculiar tribute that I ever heard paid



to a public man was given him once in the House of



Representatives by my friend Mr. Hiscock, then representative,



and afterward senator, from the State of New York. Seated by his



side in the House, and noting the rulings of Mr. Carlisle as



Speaker, I asked, "What sort of man is this Speaker of yours?"



Mr. Hiscock answered, "As you know, he is one of the strongest of



Democrats, and I am one of the strongest of Republicans; yet I



will say this: that my imagination is not strong enough to



conceive of his making an unfair ruling or doing an unfair thing



against the party opposed to him in this House."







Mr. Carlisle's talents were of a very high order. His speeches



carried great weight; and in the campaign which came on later



between Mr. McKinley and Mr. Bryan, he, in my opinion, and indeed



in the opinion, I think, of every leading public man, did a most



honorable thing when he deliberately broke from his party,



sacrificed, apparently, all hopes of political preferment, and



opposed the regular Democratic candidate. His speech before the



working-men of Chicago on the issues of that period was certainly



one of the two most important delivered during the first McKinley



campaign, the other being that of Carl Schurz.







Another man whom I saw from time to time during this period was



the Vice-President, Mr. Stevenson. I first met him at a public



dinner in New York, where we sat side by side; but we merely



talked on generalities. But the next time I met him was at a



dinner given by the Secretary of War, and there I found that he



was one of the most admirable raconteurs I had ever met. After a



series of admirable stories, one of the party said to me: "He



could tell just as good stories as those for three weeks running



and never repeat himself."







One of these stories by the Vice-President, if true, threw a



curious light over the relations of President Lincoln with three



men very distinguished in American annals. It was as follows: One



day, shortly before the issue of the Emancipation Proclamation, a



visitor, finding Mr. Lincoln evidently in melancholy mood, said



to him, "Mr. President, I am sorry to find you not feeling so



well as at my last visit." Mr. Lincoln replied: "Yes, I am



troubled. One day the best of our friends from the border States



come in and insist that I shall not issue an Emancipation



Proclamation, and that, if I do so, the border States will



virtually cast in their lot with the Southern Confederacy.



Another day, Charles Sumner, Thad Stevens, and Ben Wade come in



and insist that if I do not issue such a proclamation the North



will be utterly discouraged and the Union wrecked,--and, by the



way, these three men are coming in this very afternoon." At this



moment his expression changed, his countenance lighted up, and he



said to the visitor, who was from the West, "Mr. ----, did you



ever go to a prairie school?" "No," said the visitor, "I never



did." "Well," said Mr. Lincoln, "I did, and it was a very poor



school, and we were very poor folks,--too poor to have regular



reading-books, and so we brought our Bibles and read from them.



One morning the chapter was from the Book of Daniel, and a little



boy who sat next me went all wrong in pronouncing the names of



Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. The teacher had great difficulty



in setting him right, and before he succeeded was obliged to



scold the boy and cuff him for his stupidity. The nest verse came



to me, and so the chapter went along down the class. Presently it



started on its way back, and soon after I noticed that the little



fellow began crying. On this I asked him, 'What's the matter with



you?' and he answered, 'Don't you see? Them three miserable



cusses are coming back to me again.' "







I also at that period made the acquaintance of Senator Gray of



Delaware, who seemed to me ideally fitted for his position as a



member of the Upper House in Congress. Speaker Reed also made a



great impression upon me as a man of honesty, lucidity, and



force. The Secretary of State, Mr. Olney, I saw frequently, and



was always impressed by the sort of bulldog tenacity which had



gained his victory over Lord Salisbury in the arbitration matter.







But to give even the most hasty sketch of the members of the



Supreme Court, the cabinet, and of both houses of Congress whom I



met would require more time than is at my disposal.







This stay in Washington I enjoyed much. Our capital city is



becoming the seat of a refined hospitality which makes it more



and more attractive. Time was, and that not very long since, when



it was looked upon as a place of exile by diplomatists, and as



repulsive by many of our citizens; but all that is of the past:



the courtesy shown by its inhabitants is rapidly changing its



reputation.







Perhaps, of all the social enjoyments of that time, the most



attractive to me was an excursion of the American Geographical



Society to Monticello, the final residence of President



Jefferson. Years before, while visiting the University of



Virginia at Charlottesville, I had been intensely interested in



that creation of Mr. Jefferson and in the surroundings of his



home; but the present occupant of Monticello, having been greatly



annoyed by visitors, was understood to be reluctant to allow any



stranger to enter the mansion, and I would not intrude upon him.



But now house and grounds were freely thrown open, and upon a



delightful day. The house itself was a beautiful adaptation of



the architecture which had reached its best development at the



time of Jefferson's stay in France; and the decorations, like



those which I had noted years before in some of the rooms of the



university, were of an exquisite Louis Seize character.







Jefferson's peculiarities, also, came out in various parts of the



house. Perhaps the most singular was his bed, occupying the whole



space of an archway between two rooms, one of which, on the left,



served as a dressing-room for him, and the other, on the right,



for Mrs. Jefferson; and, there being no communication between



them save by a long circuit through various rooms, it was evident



that the ex-President had made up his mind that he would not have



his intimate belongings interfered with by any of the women of



the household, not even by his wife.







But most attractive of all was the view through the valleys and



over the neighboring hills as we sat at our picnic-tables on the



lawn. Having read with care every line of Jefferson's letters



ever published, and some writings of his which have never been



printed, my imagination was vivid. It enabled me to see him



walking through the rooms and over the estate, receiving



distinguished guests under the portico, discussing with them at



his dinner-table the great questions of the day, and promulgating



his theories, some of which were so beneficent and others so



noxious.







The only sad part of this visit was to note the destruction, by



the fire not long before, of the columns in front of the rotunda



of the university. I especially mourned over the calcined remains



of their capitals, for into these Jefferson had really wrought



his own heart. With a passion for the modern adaptation of



classic architecture, he had poured the very essence of his



artistic feelings into them. He longed to see every stroke which



his foreign sculptors made upon them. Daily, according to the



chronicle of the time, he rode over to see how they progressed,



and, between his visits, frequently observed them through his



telescope; and now all their work was but calcined limestone.



Fortunately, the burning of the old historical buildings aroused



public spirit; large sums of money were poured into the



university treasury; and the work was in process which, it is to



be hoped, will restore the former beauty of the colonnade and



largely increase the buildings and resources of the institution.







During my work upon the commission I learned to respect more and



more the calm, steady, imperturbable character of Mr. Cleveland.



Of course the sensational press howled continually, and the press



which was considered especially enlightened and which had



steadily supported him up to this period, was hardly less bitter;



but he persevered. During the period taken by the commission for



its work, both the American and British peoples had time for calm



thought. Lord Salisbury, especially, had time to think better of



it; and when he at last receded from his former haughty position



and accepted arbitration, Mr. Cleveland and the State Department



gained one of the most honorable victories in the history of



American diplomacy.















CHAPTER XL







AS AMBASSADOR TO GERMANY--1897-1903







On the 1st of April, 1897, President McKinley nominated me



ambassador to Berlin; and, the appointment having been duly



confirmed by the Senate, I visited Washington to obtain



instructions and make preparations. One of the most important of



these preparations was the securing of a second secretary for the



embassy. A long list of applicants for this position had



appeared, several with strong backing from party magnates,



cabinet officers, and senators; but, though all of them seemed



excellent young men, very few had as yet any experience likely to



be serviceable, and a look over the list suggested many



misgivings. There was especially needed just then at Berlin a



second secretary prepared to aid in disentangling sundry



important questions already before the embassy. The first



secretary, whom no person thought of displacing, was ideally



fitted for his place--in fact, was fitted for any post in the



diplomatic service; but a second secretary was needed to take, as



an expert, a mass of work on questions relating to commerce and



manufactures which were just then arising between the two nations



in shapes new and even threatening.







While the whole matter was under advisement, there appeared a



young man from Ohio, with no backing of any sort save his record.



He had distinguished himself at one of our universities as a



student in political economy and international law; had then



taken a fellowship in the same field at another university; and



had finally gone to Germany and there taken his degree, his



graduating thesis being on "The Commercial and Diplomatic



Relations between the United States and Germany." In preparing



this he had been allowed to work up a mass of material in our



embassy archives, and had afterward expanded his thesis into a



book which had gained him credit. As the most serious questions



between the two countries were commercial, he seemed a godsend;



and, going to the President, I stated the matter fully. Though



the young man was as far as possible from having any "pull" in



the State from which he came, was not at all known either to the



President or the Secretary of State or assistant secretary of



state, all of whom came from Ohio, and was equally unknown to



either of the Ohio senators or to any representative, and though



nothing whatever was known of his party affiliations, the



President, on hearing a statement of the case, ignored all



pressure in favor of rival candidates, sent in his nomination to



the Senate, and it was duly confirmed.







The next thing was the appointment of a military attache. The



position is by no means a sinecure. Our government must always



feel the importance of receiving the latest information as to the



armies and navies of the great powers of the world; and therefore



it is that, very wisely, it has attached military and naval



experts to various leading embassies. It is important that these



be not only thoroughly instructed and far-seeing, but gentlemen



in the truest sense of the word; and I therefore presented a



graduate of West Point who, having conducted an expedition in



Alaska and served with his regiment on the Western plains most



creditably, had done duty as military attache with me during my



mission at St. Petersburg, and had proved himself, in every



respect, admirable. Though he had no other supporter at the



national capital, the Secretary of War, Governor Alger, granted



my request, and he was appointed.







These matters, to many people apparently trivial, are here



alluded to because it is so often charged that political



considerations outweigh all others in such appointments, and



because this charge was frequently made against President



McKinley. The simple fact is that, with the multitude of



nominations to be made, the appointing power cannot have personal



knowledge of the applicants, and must ask the advice of persons



who have known them and can, to some extent, be held responsible



for them. In both the cases above referred to, political pressure



of the strongest in favor of other candidates went for nothing



against the ascertained interest of the public service







The Secretary of State at this time was Mr. John Sherman. I had



known him somewhat during his career as senator and Secretary of



the Treasury, and had for his character, abilities, and services



the most profound respect. I now saw him often. He had become



somewhat infirm, but his mind seemed still clear; whether at the



State Department or in social circles his reminiscences of public



men and affairs were always interesting, and one of these



confirmed an opinion I have expressed in another chapter. One



night, at a dinner-party, the discussion having fallen upon



President Andrew Johnson, and some slighting remarks having been



made regarding him by one of our company, Mr. Sherman, who had



been one of President Johnson's strongest opponents, declared him



a man of patriotic motives as well as of great ability, and



insisted that the Republican party had made a great mistake in



attempting to impeach him. In the course of the conversation one



of the foremost members of the House of Representatives, a man of



the highest standing and character, stated that he had himself,



when a young man, aided Mr. Johnson as secretary, and that he was



convinced that the ex-President could write very little more than



his signature. We had all heard the old story that after he had



become of age his newly wedded wife had taught him the alphabet,



but it was known to very few that he remained to the last so



imperfectly equipped.







Of conversations with many other leading men of that period at



Washington I remember that, at the house of my friend Dr. Hill,



afterward assistant secretary of state, mention being made of the



Blaine campaign, an eminent justice of the Supreme Court said



that Mr. Blaine always insisted to the end of his life that he



had lost the Presidency on account of the Rev. Dr. Burchard's



famous alliteration, "Rum, Romanism, and rebellion," and that the



whole was really a Democratic trick. Neither the judge nor any



other person present believed that Mr. Blaine's opinion in this



matter was well founded.







An important part of my business during this visit was to confer



with the proper persons at Washington, including the German



ambassador, Baron von Thielmann, regarding sundry troublesome



questions between the United States and Germany. The addition to



the American tariff of a duty against the sugar imports from



every other country equivalent to the sugar bounty allowed



manufactures in that country had led to special difficulties. It



had been claimed by Germany that this additional duty was



contrary to the most-favored-nation clause in our treaties; and,



unfortunately, the decisions on our side had been conflicting,



Mr. Gresham, Secretary of State under Mr. Cleveland, having



allowed that the German contention was right, and his successor,



Mr. Olney, having presented an elaborate argument to show that it



was wrong. On this point, conversations, not only with the



Secretary of State and the German ambassador, but with leading



members of the committees of Congress having the tariff in



charge, and especially with Mr. Allison and Mr. Aldrich of the



Senate and Governor Dingley of the House, showed me that the case



was complicated, the various interests somewhat excited against



each other, and that my work in dealing with them was to be



trying.







There were also several other questions no less difficult, those



relating to the exportation of American products to Germany and



the troubles already brewing in Samoa being especially prominent;



so that it was with anything but an easy feeling that, on the



29th of May, I sailed from New York.







On the 12th of June I presented the President's letter of



credence to the Emperor William II. The more important of my new



relations to the sovereign had given me no misgivings; for during



my stay in Berlin as minister, eighteen years before, I had found



him very courteous, he being then the heir apparent; but with the



ceremonial part it was otherwise, and to that I looked forward



almost with dismay.







For, since my stay in Berlin, the legation had been raised to an



embassy. It had been justly thought by various patriotic members



of Congress that it was incompatible, either with the dignity or



the interests of so great a nation as ours, to be represented



simply by a minister plenipotentiary, who, when calling at the



Foreign Office to transact business, might be obliged to wait for



hours, and even until the next day, while representatives from



much less important countries who ranked as ambassadors went in



at once. The change was good, but in making it Congress took no



thought of some things which ought to have been provided for. Of



these I shall speak later; but as regards the presentation, the



trying feature to me was that there was a great difference



between this and any ceremonial which I had previously



experienced, whether as commissioner at Santo Domingo and Paris,



or as minister at Berlin and St. Petersburg. At the presentation



of a minister plenipotentiary he goes in his own carriage to the



palace at the time appointed; is ushered into the presence of the



sovereign; delivers to him, with some simple speech, the



autograph letter from the President; and then, after a kindly



answer, all is finished. But an ambassador does not escape so



easily. Under a fiction of international law he is regarded as



the direct representative of the sovereign power of his country,



and is treated in some sense as such. Therefore it was that, at



the time appointed, a high personage of the court, in full



uniform, appeared at my hotel accompanied by various other



functionaries, with three court carriages, attendants, and



outriders, deputed to conduct me to the palace. Having been



escorted to the first of the carriages,--myself, in plain



citizen's dress, on the back seat; my escort, in gorgeous



uniform, facing me; and my secretaries and attaches in the other



carriages,--we took up our march in solemn procession--carriages,



outriders, and all--through the Wilhelmstrasse and Unter den



Linden. On either side was a gaping crowd; at the various corps



de garde bodies of troops came out and presented arms; and on our



arrival at the palace there was a presentation of arms and



beating of drums which, for the moment, somewhat abashed me. It



was an ordeal more picturesque than agreeable.







The reception by the Emperor was simple, courteous, and kindly.



Neither of us made any set speech, but we discussed various



questions, making reference to our former meeting and the changes



which had occurred since. Among these changes I referred to the



great improvement in Berlin, whereupon he said that he could not



think the enormous growth of modern cities an advantage. My



answer was that my reference was to the happy change in the



architecture of Berlin rather than to its growth in population;



that, during my first stay in the city, over forty years before,



nearly all the main buildings were of brick and stucco, whereas



there had now been a remarkable change from stucco to stone and



to a much nobler style of architecture. We also discussed the



standing of Germans in America and their relations to the United



States. On my remarking that it was just eighteen years and one



day since the first Emperor William had received me as minister



in that same palace, he spoke of various things in the history of



the intervening years; and then ensued an episode such as I had



hardly expected. For just before leaving New York my old friend



Frederick William Holls, after a dinner at his house on the



Hudson, had given his guests examples of the music written by



Frederick the Great, and one piece had especially interested us.



It was a duet in which Mr. Holls played one part upon the organ,



and his wife another upon the piano; and all of us were greatly



impressed by the dignity and beauty of the whole. It had been



brought to light and published by the present Emperor, and after



the performance some one of the party remarked, in a jocose way,



"You should express our thanks to his Majesty, when you meet him,



for the pleasure which this music has given us." I thought



nothing more of the subject until, just at the close of the



conversation above referred to, it came into my mind; and on my



mentioning it the Emperor showed at once a special interest,



discussing the music from various points of view; and on my



telling him that we were all surprised that it was not



amateurish, but really profound in its harmonies and beautiful in



its melodies, he dwelt upon the musical debt of Frederick the



Great to Bach and the special influence of Bach upon him. This



conversation recurred to me later, when the Emperor, in erecting



the statue to Frederick the Great on the Avenue of Victory,



placed on one side of it the bust of Marshal Schwerin, and on the



other that of Johann Sebastian Bach, thus honoring the two men



whom he considered most important during Frederick's reign.







After presenting my embassy secretaries and attaches, military



and naval, I was conducted with them into the presence of the



Empress, who won all our hearts by her kindly, unaffected



greeting. On my recalling her entrance into Berlin as a bride, in



her great glass coach, seventeen years before, on one of the



coldest days I ever knew, she gave amusing details of her stately



progress down the Linden on that occasion; and in response to my



congratulations upon her six fine boys and her really charming



little daughter, it was pleasant to see how







 "One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,"







her eyes lighting up with pride and joy, and her conversation



gladly turning to the children.







It may be added here that the present Empress seems to have



broken the unfortunate spell which for about half a century hung



over the queens and empresses of the house of Hohenzollern. I



remember well that, among the Germans whom I knew in my



Berlin-University days, all the sins of the period, political and



religious, seemed to be traced to the influence of Queen



Elizabeth, the consort of the reigning King Frederick William IV;



and that, during my first official stay in the same capital as



minister, a similar feeling was shown toward the Empress Augusta,



in spite of her most kindly qualities and her devotion to every



sort of charitable work; and that the crown princess, afterward



the Empress Frederick, in spite of all her endowments of head and



heart, was apparently more unpopular than either of her two



predecessors. But the present Empress seems to have changed all



this, and, doubtless, mainly by her devotion to her husband and



her children, which apparently excludes from her mind all care



for the great problems of the universe outside her family. So



strong is this feeling of kindness toward her that it was comical



to see, at one period during my stay, when she had been brought



perilously near a most unpopular course of action, that everybody



turned at once upon her agent in the matter, saying nothing about



her, but belaboring him unmercifully, though he was one of the



most attractive of men.







These presentations being finished, our return to the Kaiserhof



Hotel was made with the same ceremony as that with which we had



come to the palace, and happy was I when all was over.







Of the other official visits at this time, foremost in importance



was that to the chancellor of the empire, Prince Hohenlohe.



Although he was then nearly eighty years old and bent with age,



his mind in discussing public matters was entirely clear. Various



later conversations with him also come back to me--one,



especially, at a dinner he gave at the chancellor's palace to



President Harrison. On my recalling the fact that we were in the



room where I had first dined with Bismarck, Prince Hohenlohe gave



a series of reminiscences of his great predecessor, some of them



throwing a strong light upon his ideas and methods. On one



occasion, at my own table, he spoke very thoughtfully on German



characteristics, and one of his remarks surprised me: it was that



the besetting sin of the Germans is envy (Neid); in which remark



one may see a curious tribute to the tenacity of the race, since



Tacitus justified a similar opinion. He seemed rather melancholy;



but he had a way of saying pungent things very effectively, and



one of these attributed to him became widely known. He was



publicly advocating a hotly contested canal bill, when an



opponent said, "You will find a solid rock in the way of this



measure"; to which the chancellor rejoined, "We will then do with



the rock as Moses did: we will smite it and get water for our



canal."







As to the next visit of importance, I was especially glad to find



at the Foreign Office the newly appointed minister, Baron (now



Count) von Bulow. During the first part of my former stay, as



minister, I had done business at the Foreign Office with his



father, and found him in every respect a most congenial



representative of the German Government. It now appeared that



father and son were amazingly like each other, not only in



personal manner, but in their mode of dealing with public



affairs. With the multitude of trying questions which pressed



upon me as ambassador during nearly six years, it hardly seems



possible that I should be still alive were it not for the genial,



hearty intercourse, at the Foreign Office and elsewhere, with



Count von Bulow. Sundry German papers, indeed, attacked him as



yielding to much to me, and sundry American papers attacked me



for yielding too much to him; but both of us exerted ourselves to



do the best possible, each for his own country, and at the same



time to preserve peace and increase good feeling.







Interesting was it to me, from my first to my last days in



Berlin, to watch him in the discharge of his great duties,



especially in his dealings with hostile forces in Parliament. No



contrast could be more marked than that between his manner and



that of his great predecessor, the iron chancellor. To begin



with, no personalities could be more unlike. In the place of an



old man, big, rumbling, heavy, fiery, minatory, objurgatory,



there now stood a young man, quiet, self-possessed, easy in



speech, friendly in manner, "sweet reasonableness" apparently his



main characteristic, bubbling at times with humor, quick to turn



a laugh on a hostile bungler, but never cruel; prompt in



returning a serious thrust, but never venomous. Many of his



speeches were masterpieces in their way of handling opponents. An



attack which Bismarck would have met with a bludgeon, Bulow



parried with weapons infinitely lighter, but in some cases really



more effective. A very good example was on an occasion when the



old charge of "Byzantinism" was flung at the present regime, to



which he replied, not by a historical excursus or political



disquisition, but by humorously deprecating a comparison of the



good, kindly, steady-going, hard-working old privy councilors and



other state officials of Berlin with fanatics, conspirators, and



assassins who played leading parts at Constantinople during the



decline of the Eastern Empire. In the most stormy discussions I



never saw him other than serene; under real provocation he



remained kindly; more than one bitter opponent he disarmed with a



retort; but there were no poisoned wounds. The German Parliament,



left to itself, can hardly be a peaceful body. The lines of



cleavage between parties are many, and some of them are old



chasms of racial dislike and abysses of religious and social



hate; but the appearance of the young chancellor at his desk



seemed, even on the darkest days, to bring sunshine.







Occasionally, during my walks in the Thiergarten, I met him on



his way to Parliament; and, no matter how pressing public



business might be, he found time to extend his walk and prolong



our discussions. On one of these walks I alluded to a hot debate



of the day before and to his suavity under provocation, when he



answered: "Old ----, many years ago, gave me two counsels, and I



have always tried to mind them. These were: 'Never worry; never



lose your temper.' "







A pet phrase among his critics is that he is a diplomatist and



not a statesman. Like so many antitheses, this is misleading. It



may be just to say that his methods are, in general, those of a



diplomatist rather than of a statesman; but certain it is that in



various debates of my time he showed high statesmanlike



qualities, and notably at the beginning of the war with China and



in sundry later contests with the agrarians and socialists. Even



his much criticized remark during the imbroglio between Turkey



and Greece, picturing Germany as laying down her flute and



retiring from the "European Concert," which to many seemed mere



persiflage, was the humorous presentation of a policy dictated by



statesmanship. Nor were all his addresses merely light and



humorous; at times, when some deep sentiment had been stirred, he



was eloquent, rising to the height of great arguments and taking



broad views.







No one claims that he is a Richelieu, a William Pitt, or a



Cavour; but the work of such men is not what the German Empire



just now requires. The man needed at present is the one who can



keep things GOING, who can minimize differences, resist



extremists, turn aside marplots, soothe doctrinaires, and thus



give the good germs in the empire a chance to grow. For this work



it would be hard to imagine a better man than the present



chancellor. His selection and retention by the Emperor prove that



the present monarch has inherited two of the best qualities of



his illustrious grandfather: skill in recognizing the right man



and firmness in standing by him.







The next thing which an ambassador is expected to do, after



visiting the great representatives of the empire, is to become



acquainted with the official world in general.







But he must make acquaintance with these under his own roof. On



his arrival he is expected to visit the Emperor and the princes



of his family, the imperial chancellor, and the minister of



foreign affairs, but all others are expected to visit him; hence



the most pressing duty on my arrival was to secure a house, and,



during three months following, all the time that I could possibly



spare, and much that I ought not to have spared, was given to



excursions into all parts of the city to find it. No house, no



ambassador. A minister plenipotentiary can live during his first



year in a hotel or in a very modest apartment; an ambassador



cannot. He must have a spacious house fully furnished before he



can really begin his duties; for, as above stated, one of the



first of these duties is to make the acquaintance of the official



world,--the ministers of the crown, the diplomatic corps, the



members of the Imperial Parliament, the members of the Prussian



legislature, the foremost men in the army and navy, and the



leaders in public life generally,--and to this end he must give



three very large receptions, at which all those personages visit



him. This is a matter of which the court itself takes charge, so



far as inviting and presenting the guests is concerned, high



court officials being sent to stand by the side of the ambassador



and ambassadress and make the introductions to them; but, as



preliminary to all this, the first thing is to secure a residence



fit for such receptions and for entertainments in connection with



them.







Under the rules of European nations generally, these receptions



must be held at the ambassador's permanent residence; but,



unfortunately, such a thing as a large furnished apartment



suitable for a foreign representative is rarely to be found in



Berlin. In London and Paris such apartments are frequently



offered, but in Berlin hardly ever. Every other nation which



sends an ambassador to Berlin--and the same is true as regards



the other large capitals of Europe--owns a suitable house, or at



least holds a long lease of a commodious apartment; but, although



President Cleveland especially recommended provision for such



residence in one of his messages, nothing has yet been done by



the American Congress, and the consequence is that every



ambassador has to lose a great amount of valuable time, effort,



and money in securing proper quarters, while his country loses



much of its proper prestige and dignity by constant changes in



the location of its embassy, and by the fact that the American



representative is not infrequently obliged to take up his



residence in unfit apartments and in an unsuitable part of the



town.







After looking at dozens of houses, the choice was narrowed down



to two; but, as one was nearly three miles from the center of the



city, selection was made of the large apartment which I occupied



during nearly four years, and which was bought from under my feet



by one of the smallest governments in Europe as the residence for



its minister. Immediately after my lease was signed there began a



new series of troubles. Everything must be ready for the three



receptions by the eighth day of January; and, being at the mercy



of my landlord, I was at a great disadvantage. Though paying



large rent for the apartment, I was obliged, at my own expense,



to put it thoroughly in order, introducing electric light,



perfecting heating apparatus, getting walls and floors in order,



and doing a world of work which, under other circumstances, would



have been done by the proprietor himself. As to furnishing, a



peculiar difficulty arose. Berlin furnishers, as a rule, have



only samples in stock, and a long time is required for completing



sets. My former experience, when, as minister, I had been obliged



to go through a similar ordeal, had shown me that the Berlin



makers could never be relied upon to get the apartment furnished



in time; and therefore it was that, having secured what was



possible in Berlin, I was obliged to make large purchases at



Dresden, London, and Paris, and to have the furniture from the



last-named city hurried on to Berlin in special wadded cars, with



attendants to put it in place. It was a labor and care to which



no representative of the United States or of any other power



ought to be subjected. The vexations and difficulties seemed



unending; but at last carpenters, paper-hangers, electric-light



men, furniture men, carpet-layers, upholsterers, and the like



were driven from the house just five minutes before the



chancellor of the empire arrived to open the first of these three



official receptions. Happily they all went off well, and thereby



began my acquaintance with the leaders in various departments of



official life.







On my settling down to the business of the embassy, it appeared



that the changes in public sentiment since my former stay as



minister, eighteen years before, were great indeed. At that time



German feeling was decidedly friendly to the United States. The



Germans had sided with us in our Civil War, and we had come out



victorious; we had sided with them in their war of 1870-1871, and



they had come out victorious. But all this was now changed.



German feeling toward us had become generally adverse and, in



some parts of the empire, bitterly hostile. The main cause of



this was doubtless our protective policy. Our McKinley tariff,



which was considered almost ruinous to German manufactures, had



been succeeded by the Dingley tariff, which went still further;



and as Germany, in the last forty years, had developed an amazing



growth of manufactures, much bitterness resulted.







Besides this, our country was enabled, by its vast extent of



arable land, as well as by its cheap conveyance and skilful



handling of freights, to sweep into the German markets



agricultural products of various sorts, especially meats, and to



undersell the native German producers. This naturally vexed the



landed proprietors, so that we finally had against us two of the



great influential classes in the empire: the manufacturers and



the landowners.







But this was not all. These real difficulties were greatly



increased by fictitious causes of ill feeling. Sensational



articles, letters, telegrams, caricatures, and the like, sent



from America to Germany and from Germany to America, had become



more and more exasperating, until, at the time of my arrival,



there were in all Germany but two newspapers of real importance



friendly to the United States. These two journals courageously



stood up for fairness and justice, but all the others were more



or less hostile, and some bitterly so. The one which, on account



of its zeal in securing news, I read every morning was of the



worst. During the Spanish War it was especially virulent, being



full of statements and arguments to show that corruption was the



main characteristic of our government, cowardice of our army and



navy, and hypocrisy of our people. Very edifying were its



quasi-philosophical articles; and one of these, showing the



superiority of the Spanish women to their American sisters,



especially as regards education, was a work of genius. The love



of Spanish women for bull-fights was neatly glossed over, and



various absurd charges against American women were put in the



balance against it. A few sensational presses on our side were



perhaps worse. Various newspapers in America repaid Teutonic



hostility by copious insults directed at everything German, and



this aroused the Germans yet more. One journal, very influential



among the aristocratic and religious public of Northern Germany,



regularly published letters of considerable literary merit from



its American correspondent, in which every scandal which could be



raked out of the gutters of the cities, every crime in the



remotest villages, and all follies of individuals everywhere,



were kneaded together into statements showing that our country



was the lowest in the scale of human civilization. The tu-quoque



argument might have been used by an American with much effect;



for just about this period there were dragging along, in the



Berlin and other city journals, accounts of German trials for



fraud and worse, surpassing, in some respects, anything within my



memory of American tribunals. The quantity of fig-leaves required



in some of these trials was enormous; and, despite all



precautions, some details which escaped into the press might well



bring a blush to the most hardened American offender. It was both



vexatious and comical to see the smug, Pharisaical way in which



many journals ignored all these things, and held up their hands



in horror at American shortcomings. Some trials, too, which at



various times revealed the brutality of sundry military officers



toward soldiers, were heartrending; and especially one or two



duels, which occurred during my stay, presented features



calculated to shock the toughest American rough-rider. But all



this seemed not for a moment to withdraw the attention of our



Teutonic censors from American folly and wickedness. One of the



main charges constantly made was that in America there was a



"Deutschen Hetze." Very many German papers had really persuaded



themselves, and apparently had convinced a large part of the



German people, that throughout our country there existed a hate,



deep and acrid, of everything German and especially of



German-Americans. The ingenuity of some German papers in



supporting this thesis was wonderful. On one occasion a petty



squabble in a Roman Catholic theological school in the United



States between the more liberal element and a reactionary German



priest, in which the latter came to grief, was displayed as an



evidence that the American people were determined to drive out



all German professors and to abjure German science. The doings of



every scapegrace in an American university, of every silly woman



in Chicago, of every blackguard in New York, of every snob at



Newport, of every desperado in the Rocky Mountains, of every club



loafer anywhere, were served up as typical examples of American



life. The municipal governments of our country, and especially



that of New York, were an exhaustless quarry from which specimens



of every kind of scoundrelism were drawn and used in building up



an ideal structure of American life; corruption, lawlessness, and



barbarism being its most salient features.







Nor was this confined to the more ignorant. Men who stood high in



the universities, men of the greatest amiability, who in former



days had been the warmest friends of America, had now become our



bitter opponents, and some of their expressions seemed to point



to eventual war.







Yet I doubt whether we have any right to complain of such attacks



and misrepresentations. As a matter of fact, no nation washes so



much of its dirty linen in the face of the whole world as does



our own; and, what is worse, there is washed in our country, with



much noise and perversity, a great deal of linen which is not



dirty. Many demagogues and some "reformers" are always doing



this. There is in America a certain class of excellent people who



see nothing but the scum on the surface of the pot; nothing but



the worst things thrown to the surface in the ebullition of



American life. Or they may be compared to people who, with a



Persian carpet before them, persist in looking at its seamy side,



and finding nothing but odds and ends, imperfect joints,



unsatisfactory combinations of color; the real pattern entirely



escaping them. The shrill utterances of such men rise above the



low hum of steady good work, and are taken in Germany as exact



statements of the main facts in our national life.







Let me repeat here one example which I have given more than once



elsewhere. Several years since, an effort was made to impeach the



President of the United States. The current was strong, and most



party leaders thought it best to go with it. Three senators of



the United States sturdily refused, their leader being William



Pitt Fessenden of Maine, who, believing the impeachment an



attempt to introduce Spanish-American politics into our country,



resolutely opposed it. The State convention of his party called



upon him to vote for it, the national convention of the party



took the same ground, his relatives and friends besought him to



yield, but he stood firmly against the measure, and finally, by



his example and his vote, defeated it. It was an example of



Spartan fortitude, of Roman heroism, worthy to be chronicled by



Plutarch. How was it chronicled? I happened to be traveling in



Germany at the time, and naturally watched closely for the result



of the impeachment proceedings. One morning I took up a German



paper containing the news and read, "The impeachment has been



defeated; three senators were bribed," and at the head of the



list of bribed senators was the name of Fessenden! The time will



come when his statue will commemorate his great example; let us



hope that the time will also come when party spirit will not be



allowed to disgrace our country by sending out to the world such



monstrous calumnies.







As to attacks upon the United States, it is only fair to say that



German publicists and newspaper writers were under much



provocation. Some of the American correspondents then in Germany



showed wonderful skill in malignant invention. My predecessors in



the embassy had suffered much from this cause. One of them, whom



I had known from his young manhood as a gentleman of refined



tastes and quiet habits, utterly incapable of rudeness of any



sort, was accused, in a sensational letter published in various



American journals, of having become so noisy and boisterous at



court that the Emperor was obliged to rebuke him. Various hints



of a foul and scandalous character were sent over and published.



I escaped more easily, but there were two or three examples which



were both vexatious and amusing.







Shortly after my arrival at my post, letters and newspaper



articles began coming deploring the conduct of the Germans toward



me, expressing deep sympathy with me, exhorting me to "stand



firm," declaring that the American people were behind me, etc.,



etc., all of which puzzled me greatly until I found that some



correspondent had sent over a telegram to the effect that the



feeling against America had become so bitter that the Emperor



himself had been obliged to intervene and command the officials



of his empire to present themselves at my official reception; and



with this statement was coupled a declaration that I had made the



most earnest remonstrance to the Imperial Government against such



treatment. The simple fact was that the notice was in the



stereotyped form always used when an ambassador arrives. On every



such occasion the proper authorities notify all the persons



concerned, giving the time of his receptions, and this was simply



what was done in my case. On another occasion, telegrams were



sent over to American papers stating that the first secretary of



the embassy and myself, on visiting Parliament to hear an



important debate, had been grossly insulted by various members.



The fact was that we had been received by everybody with the



utmost kindness; that various members had saluted us in the most



friendly manner from the floor or had come into the diplomatic



gallery to welcome us; and that there was not the slightest



shadow of reason for the statement. As an example of the genius



shown in some of these telegrams, another may be mentioned. A



very charming American lady, niece of a member of Mr. McKinley's



cabinet, having arrived on the Norwegian coast, her children were



taken on board the yacht of the Emperor, who was then cruising in



those regions; and later, on their arrival at Berlin, they with



their father and mother were asked by him to the palace to meet



his own wife and children. A few days afterward a telegram was



published in America to the effect that the Emperor, in speaking



to Mrs. White and myself regarding the children, had said that he



was especially surprised, because he had always understood that



American children were badly brought up and had very bad manners.



The simple fact was that, while he spoke of the children with



praise, the rest of the story was merely a sensational invention.



One of the marvels of American life is the toleration by decent



fathers and mothers of sensational newspapers in their



households. Of all the demoralizing influences upon our people,



and especially upon our young people, they are the most steadily



and pervasively degrading. Horace Greeley once published a



tractate entitled, "New Themes for the Clergy," and I would



suggest the evil influence of sensation newsmongering as a most



fruitful theme for the exhortations of all American clergymen to



their flocks, whether Catholic, Jewish, or Protestant. May we not



hope, also, that Mr. Pulitzer's new College of Journalism will



give careful attention to this subject?







As to public questions then demanding attention, the first which



I now recall was a bit of international comedy, serving as a



prelude to more important matters, and worth mentioning here only



as showing a misconception very absurd, yet not without dangers.







One morning, as I had just sat down to my office work, there was



ushered in, with due ceremony, a young gentleman of light color,



Parisian to the tips of his fingers,--in accent, manner, and



garb,--who was announced as the charge d'affaires of Haiti. He



was evidently under deep concern, and was soon in the midst of a



somewhat impassioned statement of his business.







It appeared that his government, like so many which had preceded



it, after a joyous career of proclamations, revolutions,



throat-cutting, confiscation, paper money, and loans, public and



private, had at last met a check, and that in this instance the



check had come in the shape of a German frigate which had dropped



into the harbor of Port-au-Prince, run out its guns, and demanded



redress of injuries and payment of debts to Germany and German



subjects; and the charge, after dwelling upon the enormity of



such a demand, pointed out the duty of the United States to



oblige Germany to desist,--in short, to assert the Monroe



Doctrine as he understood it.







The young diplomatist's statement interested me much; it brought



back vividly to my mind the days when, as a commissioner from the



United States, I landed at Port-au-Prince, observed the wreck and



ruin caused by a recent revolution, experienced the beauties of a



paper-money system carried out so logically that a market-basket



full of currency was needed to buy a market-basket full of



vegetables, visited the tombs of the presidents from which the



bodies of their occupants had been torn and scattered, saw the



ring to which President Salnave had recently been tied when the



supporters of his successor had murdered him, and mused over the



ruins of the presidential mansion, which had been torn in pieces



by bombs from a patriotic vessel. My heart naturally warmed



toward the representative of so much glory, and it seemed sad to



quench his oratorical fire and fervor with a cold statement of



fact. But my duty was plain: I assured him that neither the



President whose name the famous "Doctrine" bears, nor the



Secretary of State who devised it, nor the American people behind



them, had any idea of protecting our sister republics in such



conduct as that of which the Germans complained; and I concluded



by fervently exhorting him to advise his government and people



simply to--pay their debts.







It gave me pleasure to learn, somewhat later, that this very



prosaic solution of the difficulty had been adopted.







I make haste to add that nothing which may be said here or



elsewhere in these recollections regarding sundry equatorial



governments has any reference to our sister republics of South



America really worthy of the name. No countries were in my time



more admirably represented at Berlin than the Argentine Republic,



Chile, and Brazil. The first-named sent as its minister the most



eminent living authority on international law; the second, a



gentleman deeply respected for character and ability, whose



household was one of the most beautiful and attractive I have



ever known; and the third, a statesman and scholar worthy of the



best traditions of his country.







As to more complicated international matters with which my



embassy had to deal, the first to assume a virulent form was that



of the Samoan Islands.







During the previous twenty-five years the United States, Germany,



and Great Britain had seemed to develop equal claims in Samoa.



There had been clashes from time to time, in which good sense had



generally prevailed; but in one case a cyclone which destroyed



the German and American vessels of war in the main port of the



islands seemed providential in preventing a worse form of



trouble.







But now the chronic difficulties became acute. In the consuls of



the three powers what Bismarck used to call the furor consularis



was developed to the highest degree. Yet this was not the worst.



Under the Berlin agreement, made some years before, there was a



German president of the municipality of Apia with ill-defined



powers, and an American chief justice with powers in some



respects enormous, and each of these naturally magnified his



office at the expense of the other. To complete the elements of



discord, there were two great native parties, each supporting its



candidate for kingship; and behind these, little spoken of, but



really at the bottom of the main trouble, were



missionaries,--English Wesleyans on one side, and French Roman



Catholics on the other,--each desiring to save the souls of the



natives, no matter at what sacrifice of their bodies.







This tea-pot soon began to boil violently. The old king having



died, the question arose as to the succession. The power of



appointing the successor having been in the most clear and



definite terms bestowed by the treaty upon the chief justice, he



named for the position Malietoa Tanu, a young chieftain who had



been induced to call himself a Protestant; but on the other side



was Mataafa, an old chief who years before had made much trouble,



had been especially obnoxious to the Germans, and had been



banished, but had been recently allowed to return on his taking



oath that he would abstain from all political action, and would



be true to his allegiance to the Malietoan kings. He had been



induced to call himself a Catholic.







But hardly had he returned when, having apparently been absolved



from his oath, he became the leader of a political party and



insisted on his right to the kingship.







The result was a petty civil war which cost many lives. Nor was



this all. A drunken Swiss having one day amused himself by



breaking the windows of the American chief justice's court and no



effective punishment having been administered by the German



president of Apia, the Yankee chief justice took the matter into



his own hands, and this Little Pedlington business set in motion



sensation-mongers throughout the world. They exerted themselves



to persuade the universe that war might, and indeed ought to,



result between the three great nations concerned. On the arrival



of the American Admiral Kautz, he simply and naturally supported



the decree which the chief justice had made, in strict accordance



with the treaty of Berlin, and was finally obliged to fire upon



the insurgents. Now came a newspaper carnival: screams of wrath



from the sensation press of Germany and yells of defiance from



the sensation press of the United States.







It was fortunate, indeed, that at this period the American



Secretary of State was Mr. John Hay and the German minister of



foreign affairs Count von Bulow. Both at Washington and Berlin



the light of plain common sense was gradually let into this



jungle of half truths and whole falsehoods; the appointment of an



excellent special commission, who supplanted all the officials in



the islands by new men, solved various preliminary problems, so



that finally a treaty was made between the three nations



concerned which swept away the old vicious system, partitioned



the islands between the United States and Germany, giving Great



Britain indemnity elsewhere, and settled all the questions



involved, as we may hope, forever.







Among my duties and pleasures during this period was attendance



upon important debates in the Imperial Parliament. That body



presents many features suggestive of thought. The arrangement



under which the Senate, representing the various states of the



empire, and the House, representing the people as a whole, sit



face to face in joint deliberation, strikes an American as



especially curious; but it seems to work well, and has one



advantage in bringing the most eminent servants of the various



states into direct personal relations with the rank and file from



the country at large. The German Parliament has various good



points. Some one has asserted that the United States Senate is as



much better than the British House of Lords as the British House



of Commons is better than the American House of Representatives.



There is much to be said for this contention, and there are some



points in which the German Parliament also struck me as an



improvement upon our Lower House: they do less than we in



committee, and more in the main assemblage; German members are



more attentive to the work in hand, and spread-eagleism and



speeches to the galleries which are tolerated at Washington are



not tolerated at Berlin. On the other hand, the members at



Berlin, not being paid for their services, absent themselves in



such numbers that the lack of a sufficient deliberating body has



been found, at times, a serious evil.







As to men prominent in debate, allusion has already been made to



the chancellor, and various ministers of the crown might be



added, of whom I should give the foremost place to the minister



of the interior, Count Posadowski. His discussions of all matters



touching his department, and, indeed, of some well outside it,



were masterly. Save, perhaps, our own Senator John Sherman, I



have never heard so USEFUL a speaker on fundamental questions of



public business. As to the representatives, there were many well



worth listening to; but the two who attracted most attention were



Richter, the head of the "Progressist," or, as we should call it,



the radical fraction, and Bebel, the main representative of the



Socialists. Richter I had heard more than once in my old days,



and had been impressed by his extensive knowledge of imperial



finance, his wit and humor, his skill in making his points, and



his strength in enforcing them. He was among the few still



remaining after my long absence, and it was clear to me that he



had not deteriorated,--that he had, indeed, mellowed in a way



which made him even more interesting than formerly. As to Bebel,



though generally disappointing at first, he was quite sure, in



every speech, to raise some point which put the conservatives on



their mettle. His strongest characteristic seems to be his



earnestness: the earnestness of a man who has himself known what



the hardest struggle for existence is, and what it means to



suffer for his opinions. His weakest point seems to be a tendency



to exaggeration which provokes distrust; but, despite this, he



has been a potent force as an irritant in drawing attention to



the needs of the working-classes, and so in promoting that steady



uplifting of their condition and prospects which is one of the



most striking achievements of modern Germany.







Among the many other members interesting on various accounts was



one to whom both Germans and Americans might well listen with



respect--Herr Theodor Barth, editor of "Die Nation," a



representative of the best traditions of the old National Liberal



party. He seemed to me one of the very few Germans who really



understood the United States. He had visited America more than



once, and had remained long enough to get in touch with various



leaders of American thought, and to penetrate below the mere



surface of public affairs. Devoted as he was to his own



fatherland, he seemed to feel intuitively the importance to both



countries of accentuating permanent points of agreement rather



than transient points of difference; hence it was that in his



paper he steadily did us justice, and in Parliament was sure to



repel any unmerited assault upon our national character and



policy. He was clear and forcible, with, at times, a most



effectively caustic utterance against unreason.







While the whole parliamentary body is suggestive to an American,



the Parliament building is especially suggestive to a New-Yorker.



This great edifice at Berlin is considerably larger on the ground



than is the State Capitol at Albany. It is built of a very



beautiful and durable stone, and, in spite of sundry criticisms



on the dome in the center and the pavilions at the corners, is



vastly superior, as a whole, to the Albany building. It is



enriched in all parts, without and within, with sculpture



recalling the historical glories of all parts of the empire and



calculated to stir patriotic pride; it is beautified by paintings



on a great scale by eminent artists; its interior fittings, in



stone, marble, steel, bronze, and oak, are as beautiful and



perfect as the art of the period has been able to make them; and



the whole, despite minor architectural faults, is worthy of the



nation. The building was completed and in use within ten years



from the time of its beginning. The construction of the



State-house at Albany, a building not so large, and containing



to-day no work of art either in painting or sculpture worthy of



notice, has dragged along during thirty years, and cost nearly



four times as much as the Berlin edifice; the latter having



demanded an outlay of a trifle over five million dollars, and the



former considerably over twenty millions.







The German Parliament House, apart from slight defects, as a



great architectural creation is in a style worthy of its



purpose--a style which is preserved in all its parts; while that



at Albany is, perhaps, the most curious jumble in the whole



history of architecture,--the lower stories being Palladian; the



stories above these being, if anything, Florentine; the summit



being, if anything, French Renaissance; while, as regards the



interior, the great west staircase, which is said to have cost



half a million of dollars, is in the Richardsonesque style; the



eastern staircase is in classic style; and a circular staircase



in the interior is in the most flamboyant Gothic which could be



got for money. To be sure, there are rooms at Albany on which



precious Siena marble and Mexican onyx are lavished, but these



are used so as to produce mainly the effect of an unintelligent



desire to spend money.







While in or near the Berlin edifice there is commemoration by



sculpture or painting of a multitude of meritorious public



servants, there is nowhere in the whole building at Albany a



statue or any fit remembrance of the two greatest governors in



the history of the State, DeWitt Clinton and William H. Seward.







The whole thing plunges one into reflection. If that single



building at Albany, which was estimated, upon plans carefully



made by the best of architects, to cost five millions of dollars,



and to be completed in four years, required over thirty years and



an expenditure of over twenty millions, what is a great "barge



canal" to cost, running through the whole length of the State,



encountering enormous difficulties of every sort, estimated at



the beginning to cost one hundred millions of dollars, but



including no estimate for "land damages," "water damages,"



"personal damages," "unprecedented floods," "unforeseen



obstacles," "quicksands," "changes of plan," etc., etc., which



have played such a costly and corrupting part in the past history



of our existing New York canals? And how many years will it take



to complete it? This was the train of thought and this was its



resultant query forced upon me whenever I looked upon the



Parliament House at Berlin.















CHAPTER XLI







AMERICA, GERMANY, AND THE SPANISH WAR--1897-1903







During the early days of this second official stay of mine at



Berlin, Russia had, in one way and another, secured an entrance



into China for her trans-Siberian railway, and seemed to have



taken permanent possession of the vast region extending from her



own territory to the Pacific at Port Arthur. Germany followed



this example, and, in avenging the murder of certain



missionaries, took possession of the harbor of Kiao-Chau. Thereby



other nations were stirred to do likewise,--England, France, and



Italy beginning to move for extensions of territory or commercial



advantages, until it looked much as if China was to be parceled



out among the greater European powers, or at least held in



commercial subjection, to the exclusion of those nations which



had pursued a more dilatory policy.







Seeing this danger, our government instructed its representatives



at the courts of the great powers to request them to join in a



declaration in favor of an "open-door policy" in China, thus



establishing virtually an international agreement that none of



the powers obtaining concessions or controlling "spheres of



influence" in that country should secure privileges infringing



upon the equality of all nations in competing for Chinese trade.



This policy was pushed with vigor by the Washington cabinet, and



I was instructed to secure, if possible, the assent of the German



Government, which, after various conferences at the Foreign



Office and communications with the minister of foreign affairs,



some more, some less, satisfactory, I was at last able to do. The



assent was given very guardedly, but not the less effectively.



Its terms were that Germany, having been from the first in favor



of equal rights to all nations in the trade of China, would



gladly acquiesce in the proposed declaration if the other powers



concerned would do so.







The Emperor William himself was even more open and direct than



his minister. At his dinner to the ambassadors in the spring of



1900, he spoke to me very fully on the subject, and, in a



conversation which I have referred to elsewhere, assured me of



his complete and hearty concurrence in the American policy,



declaring, "We must stand together for the open door."







Finally, on the 9th of April, 1900, I had the satisfaction of



sending to the German Foreign Office the proofs that all the



other powers concerned, including Japan, had joined in the



American declaration, and that the government of the United



States considered this acquiescence to be full and final.







It was really a great service rendered to the world by Mr.



McKinley and Secretary Hay; their action was farseeing, prompt,



bold, and successful.







Yet another subject of contention was the exclusion of sundry



American insurance companies from Germany, due in part to a



policy of "protection," but also to that same distrust of certain



American business methods which had given me much trouble in



dealing with the same question at St. Petersburg. The discussions



were long and tedious, but resulted in a sort of modus vivendi



likely to lead to something better.







The American sugar duties were also a sore subject. Various



writers in the German press and orators in public bodies



continued to insist that America had violated the treaties;



America insisted that she had not; and this trouble, becoming



chronic, aggravated all others. The main efforts of Count von



Bulow and myself were given to allaying inflammation by doses of



common sense and poultices of good-will until common sense could



assert its rights.







The everlasting meat question also went through various vexatious



phases, giving rise to bitter articles in the newspapers,



inflammatory speeches in Parliament, and measures in various



parts of the empire which, while sometimes honest, were always



injurious. American products which had been inspected in the



United States and Hamburg were again broken into, inspected, and



reinspected in various towns to which they were taken for retail,



with the result that the packages were damaged or spoiled, and



the costs of inspection and reinspection ate up all profits. I



once used an illustration of this at the Foreign Office that



seemed to produce some effect. It was the story of the Yankee



showman who, having been very successful in our Northern and



Middle States, took his show to the South, but when he returned



had evidently been stripped of his money. Being asked regarding



it, he said that his show had paid him well at first, but that on



arriving in Texas the authorities of each little village insisted



on holding an inquest over his Egyptian mummy, charging him



coroner's fees for it, and that this had made him a bankrupt.







Speeches, bitter and long, were made on both sides of the



Atlantic; the cable brought reports of drastic reprisals



preparing in Washington; but finally a system was adopted to



which the trade between the two countries has since been uneasily



trying to adjust itself.







Then there was sprung upon us the fruit question. One morning



came a storm of telegrams and letters stating that cargoes of



American fruits had been stopped in the German harbors, under the



charge that they contained injurious insects. The German



authorities were of course honest in this procedure, though they



were doubtless stimulated to it by sundry representatives of the



land-owning class. Our beautiful fruits, especially those of



California, had come to be very extensively used throughout the



empire, and the German consumers had been growing more and more



happy and the German producers more and more unhappy over this



fact, when suddenly there came from the American side accounts of



the scale-insects discovered on pears in California, and of



severe measures taken by sundry other States of our Union to



prohibit their importation. The result was a prohibition of our



fruits in Germany, and this was carried so far that not only



pears from California, but all other fruits, from all other parts



of the country, were at first put under the ban; and not only



fresh but dried and preserved fruits. As a matter of fact, there



was no danger whatever from the scale-insect, so far as fruit was



concerned. The creature never stirs from the spot on the pear to



which it fastens itself, and therefore by no possibility can it



be carried from the house where the fruit is consumed to the



nurseries where trees are grown. We took pains to show the facts



in the case; dealing fairly and openly with the German



Government, allowing that the importation of scale-infested trees



and shrubs might be dangerous, and making no objection to any



fair measures regarding these. The Foreign Office was reasonable,



and gradually the most vexatious of these prohibitions were



removed.







But the war with Spain drew on, and animosities, so far as the



press on both sides of the water was concerned, grew worse.



Various newspapers in Germany charged our government with a



wonderful assortment of high crimes and misdemeanors; but,



happily, in their eagerness to cover us with obloquy, they



frequently refuted each other. Thus they one day charged us with



having prepared long beforehand to crush Spain and to rob her of



her West Indian possessions, and the next day they charged us



with plunging into war suddenly, recklessly, utterly careless of



the consequences. One moment they insisted that American sailors



belonged to a deteriorated race of mongrels, and could never



stand against pure-blooded Spanish sailors; and the next moment,



that we were crushing the noble navy of Spain by brute force.



Various presses indulged in malignant prophecies: the Americans



would find Spain a very hard nut to crack; Spanish soldiers would



drive the American mongrels into the sea; when Cervera got out



with his fleet, the American fleet would slink away; Spanish



ships, being built under the safeguard of Spanish honor, must win



the victory; American ships, built under a regime of corruption,



would be found furnished with sham plating, sham guns, and sham



supplies of every sort. It all reminded me of sundry prophecies



we used to hear before our Civil War to the effect that, when the



Northern and Southern armies came into the presence of each



other, the Yankee soldiers would trade off their muskets to the



foe.







Against President McKinley every sort of iniquity was charged.



One day he was an idiot; another day, the most cunning of



intriguers; at one moment, an overbearing tyrant anxious to rush



into war; at another, a coward fearing war. It must be confessed



that this was mainly drawn from the American partizan press; but



it was, none the less, hard to bear.







In the meantime President McKinley, his cabinet, and the American



diplomatic corps in Europe did everything in their power to



prevent the war. Just as long as possible the President clearly



considered that his main claim on posterity would be for



maintaining peace against pressure and clamor. Under orders from



the State Department I met at Paris my old friend General



Woodford, who was on his way to Spain as minister of the United



States, and General Porter, the American ambassador to France,



our instructions being to confer regarding the best means of



maintaining peace; and we all agreed that everything possible be



done to allay the excitement in Spain; that no claims of a



special sort, whether pecuniary or otherwise, should be urged



until after the tension ceased; that every concession possible



should be made to Spanish pride; and that, just as far as



possible, everything should be avoided which could complicate the



general issue with personal considerations. All of us knew that



the greatest wish of the administration was to prevent the war,



or, if that proved impossible, to delay it.







For years, in common with the great majority of American



citizens, I had believed that the Spanish West Indies must break



loose from Spain some day, but had hoped that the question might



be adjourned until the middle or end of the twentieth century.



For I knew well that the separation of Cuba from Spain would be



followed, after no great length of time, by efforts for her



annexation to the United States, and that if such annexation of



Cuba should ever occur, she must come in as a State; that there



is no use in considering any other form of government for an



outlying dominion so large and so near; that there is no other



way of annexing a dependency so fully developed, and that, even



if there were, the rivalry of political parties contending for



electoral votes would be sure to insist on giving her statehood.



I dreaded the addition to our country of a million and a half of



citizens whose ability to govern themselves was exceedingly



doubtful, to say nothing of helping to govern our Union on the



mainland. The thought of senators and representatives to be



chosen by such a constituency to reside at Washington and to



legislate for the whole country, filled me with dismay.



Especially was the admission of Cuba to statehood a fearful



prospect just at that time, when we had so many difficult



questions to meet in the exercise of the suffrage. I never could



understand then, and cannot understand now, what Senator Morgan



of Alabama, who once had the reputation of being the strongest



representative from the South, could be thinking of when he was



declaiming in the Senate, first in behalf of the "oppressed



Cubans," and next in favor of measures which tended to add them



to the United States, and so to create a vast commonwealth



largely made up of negroes and mulattos accustomed to equality



with the whites, almost within musket-shot of the negroes and



mulattos of the South, from whom the constituents of Mr. Morgan



were at that very moment withholding the right of suffrage. I



could not see then, and I cannot see now, how he could possibly



be blind to the fact that if Cuba ever becomes a State of our



Union, she will soon begin to look with sympathy on those whom



she will consider her "oppressed colored brethren" in the South;



and that she will, just as inevitably, make common cause with



them at Washington, and perhaps in some other places, and



possibly not always by means so peaceful as orating under the



roof of the Capitol.







Moreover, the nation had just escaped a terrible catastrophe at



the last general election; the ignorant, careless, and perverse



vote having gone almost solidly for a financial policy which



would have wrecked us temporarily and disgraced us eternally.



Time will, no doubt, develop a more conservative sentiment in the



States where this vote for evil was cast; as civilization deepens



and advances, better ideas will doubtless grow stronger; but it



is sure that the addition of Cuba to the United States, if it



ever comes, means the adding of a vast illiterate mass of voters



to those who at that election showed themselves so dangerous.







On all these accounts I had felt very anxious to put off the



whole Cuban question until our Republic should become so much



larger and so much more mature that the addition of a few



millions of Spanish-Americans would be of but small account in



the total vote of the country.







Then, too, I had little sympathy with aspirations for what



Spanish revolutionists call freedom, and no admiration at all for



Central American republics. I had officially examined one of them



thoroughly, had known much of others, and had no belief in the



capacity of people for citizenship who prefer to carry on



government by pronunciamtentos, who never acknowledge the rights



of majorities, who are ready to start civil war on the slightest



pretext, and who, when in power, exercise a despotism more



persistent and cruel than any since Nero and Caligula. No Russian



autocrat, claiming to govern by divine right, has ever dared to



commit the high-handed cruelties which are common in sundry West



Indian and equatorial republics. I felt that the great thing was



to gain time before doing anything which might result in the



admission of the millions trained under such influences into all



the rights, privileges, and powers of American citizenship.







But there came the destruction of the Maine in the harbor of



Havana, and thenceforward war was certain. The news was brought



to me at a gala representation of the opera at Berlin, when, on



invitation from the Emperor, the ambassadors were occupying a



large box opposite his own. Hardly had the telegram announcing



the catastrophe been placed in my hands when the Emperor entered,



and on his addressing me I informed him of it. He was evidently



shocked, and expressed a regret which, I fully believe, was



deeply sincere. He instantly asked, with a piercing look, "Was



the explosion from the outside?" My answer was that I hoped and



believed that it was not; that it was probably an interior



explosion. To my great regret, the official report afterward



obliged me to change my mind on the subject; but I still feel



that no Spanish officer or true Spaniard was concerned in the



matter. It has been my good fortune to know many Spanish



officers, and it is impossible for me to conceive one of their



kind as having taken part in so frightful a piece of treachery;



it has always seemed to be more likely that it was done by a



party of wild local fanatics, the refuse of a West Indian



seaport.







The Emperor remained firm in his first impression that the



explosion was caused from the outside. Even before this was



established by the official investigation, he had settled into



that conclusion. On one occasion, when a large number of leading



officers of the North Sea Squadron were dining with him, he asked



their opinion on this subject, and although the great



majority--indeed, almost all present--then believed that the



catastrophe had resulted from an interior explosion, he adhered



to his belief that it was from an exterior attack.







On various occasions before that time I had met my colleague the



Spanish ambassador, Senor Mendez y Vigo, and my relations with



him had been exceedingly pleasant. Each of us had tried to keep



up the hopes of the other that peace might be preserved, and down



to the last moment I took great pains to convince him of what I



knew to be the truth--that the policy of President McKinley was



to prevent war. But I took no less pains to show him that Spain



must aid the President by concessions to public opinion. My



personal sympathies, too, were aroused in behalf of my colleague.



He had passed the allotted threescore years and ten, was



evidently in infirm health, had five sons in the Spanish army,



and his son-in-law had recently been appointed minister at



Washington.







Notice of the declaration of war came to me under circumstances



somewhat embarrassing. On the 21st of April, 1898, began the



festivities at Dresden on the seventieth birthday of King Albert



of Saxony, which was also the twenty-fifth anniversary of his



accession; and in view of the high character of the King and of



the affection for him throughout Germany, and, indeed, throughout



Europe, nearly every civilized power had sent its representatives



to present its congratulations. In these the United States



joined. Throughout our country are large numbers of Saxons, who,



while thoroughly loyal to our Republic, cherish a kindly and even



affectionate feeling toward their former King and Queen.



Moreover, there was a special reason. For many years Dresden had



been a center in which very many American families congregated



for the purpose of educating their children, especially in the



German language and literature, in music, and in the fine arts;



no court in Europe had been so courteous to Americans properly



introduced, and in various ways the sovereigns had personally



shown their good feeling toward our countrymen.







It was in view of this that the Secretary of State instructed me



to present an autograph letter of congratulation from the



President to the King, and on the 20th of April I proceeded to



Dresden, with the embassy secretaries and attaches, for this



purpose. About midnight between the 20th and 21st there came a



loud and persistent knocking at my door in the hotel, and there



soon entered a telegraph messenger with an enormously long



despatch in cipher. Hardly had I set the secretaries at work upon



it than other telegrams began to come, and a large part of the



night was given to deciphering them. They announced the



declaration of war and instructed me to convey to the various



parties interested the usual notices regarding war measures:



blockade, prohibitions, exemptions, regulations, and the like.







At eleven o'clock the next morning, court carriages having taken



us over to the palace, we were going up the grand staircase in



full force when who should appear at the top, on his way down,



but the Spanish ambassador with his suite! Both of us were, of



course, embarrassed. No doubt he felt, as I did, that it would



have been more agreeable just then to meet the representative of



any other power than of that with which war had just been



declared; but I put out my hand and addressed him, if not so



cordially as usual, at least in a kindly way; he reciprocated the



greeting, and our embarrassment was at least lessened. Of course,



during the continuation of the war, our relations lacked their



former cordiality, but we remained personally friendly.







In my brief speech on delivering President McKinley's letter I



tendered to the King and Queen the President's congratulations,



with thanks for the courtesies which had been shown to my



countrymen. This was not the first occasion on which I had



discharged this latter duty, for, at a formal presentation to



these sovereigns some time before, I had taken pains to show that



we were not unmindful of their kindness to our compatriots. The



festivities which followed were interesting. There were dinners



with high state officials, gala opera, and historical



representations, given by the city of Dresden, of a very



beautiful character. On these occasions I met various eminent



personages, among others the Emperor of Austria and his prime



minister, Count Goluchowsky, both of whom discussed current



international topics with clearness and force; and I also had



rather an interesting conversation with the papal nuncio at



Munich, more recently in Paris, Lorenzelli, with reference to



various measures looking to the possible abridgment of the war.







On the third day of the festivities came a great review, and a



sight somewhat rare. To greet the King there were present the



Emperor of Germany, the Emperor of Austria, and various minor



German sovereigns, each of whom had in the Saxon army a regiment



nominally his own, and led it past the Saxon monarch, saluting



him as he reviewed it. The two Emperors certainly discharged this



duty in a very handsome, chivalric sort of way. In the evening



came a great dinner at the palace, at which the King and Queen



presided. The only speech on the occasion was one of



congratulation made by the Emperor of Austria, and it was very



creditable to him, being to all appearance extemporaneous, yet



well worded, quiet, dignified, and manly. The ceremonies closed



on Sunday with a grand "Te Deum" at the palace church, in the



presence of all the majesties,--the joy expressed by the music



being duly accentuated by cannon outside.







I may say, before closing this subject, that Thomas Jefferson's



famous letter to Governor Langdon, describing royal personages as



he knew them while minister to France before the French



Revolution, no longer applies. The events which followed the



Revolution taught the crowned heads of Europe that they could no



longer indulge in the good old Bourbon, Hapsburg, and Braganza



idleness and stupidity. Modern European sovereigns, almost



without exception, work for their living, and work hard. Few



business men go through a more severe training, or a longer and



harder day of steady work, than do most of the contemporary



sovereigns of Europe. This fact especially struck me on my



presentation, about this time, to one of the best of the minor



monarchs, the King of Wurtemberg. I found him a hearty, strong,



active-minded man--the sort of man whom we in America would call



"level-headed" and "a worker." Learning that I had once passed a



winter in Stuttgart, he detained me long with a most interesting



account of the improvements which had been made in the city since



my visit, and showed public spirit of a sort very different from



that which animated the minor potentates of Germany in the last



century. The same may be said of the Grand Duke of Baden, who, in



a long conversation, impressed me as a gentleman of large and



just views, understanding the problems of his time and thoroughly



in sympathy with the best men and movements.







Republican as I am, this acknowledgment must be made. The



historical lessons of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,



and the pressure of democracy, are obliging the monarchs of



Europe to fit themselves for their duties wisely and to discharge



them intelligently. But this is true only of certain ruling



houses. There seems to be a "survival of the fittest." At various



periods in my life I have also had occasion to observe with some



care various pretenders to European thrones, among them the



husband of Queen Isabella of Spain; Prince Napoleon Victor, the



heir to the Napoleonic throne; the Duke of Orleans; Don Carlos,



the representative of the Spanish Bourbons; with sundry others;



and it would be hard to conceive persons more utterly unfit or



futile.







As to the conduct of Germany during our war with Spain, while the



press, with two or three exceptions, was anything but friendly,



and while a large majority of the people were hostile to us on



account of the natural sympathy with a small power battling



against a larger one, the course of the Imperial Government,



especially of the Foreign Office under Count von Bulow and Baron



von Richthofen, was all that could be desired. Indeed, they went



so far on one occasion as almost to alarm us. The American consul



at Hamburg having notified me by telephone that a Spanish vessel,



supposed to be loaded with arms for use against us in Cuba, was



about to leave that port, I hastened to the Foreign Office and



urged that vigorous steps be taken, with the result that the



vessel, which in the meantime had left Hamburg, was overhauled



and searched at the mouth of the Elbe. The German Government



might easily have pleaded, in answer to my request, that the



American Government had generally shown itself opposed to any



such interference with the shipments of small arms to



belligerents, and had contended that it was not obliged to search



vessels to find such contraband of war, but that this duty was



incumbent upon the belligerent nation concerned. This evidence of



the fairness of Germany I took pains to make known, and in my



address at the American celebration in Leipsic on the Fourth of



July declared my belief that the hostility of the German people



and press at large was only temporary, and that the old good



relations would be restored. Knowing that my speech would be



widely quoted in the German press, I took even more pains to show



the reasons why we could bide our time and trust to the



magnanimity of the German people. Of one thing I then and always



reminded my hearers--namely, that during our Civil War, when our



national existence was trembling in the balance and our foreign



friends were few, the German press and people were steadily on



our side.







The occasion was indeed a peculiar one. On the morning of the



Fourth, when we had all assembled, bad news came. Certain German



presses had been very prompt to patch together all sorts of



accounts of American defeats, and to present them in the most



unpleasant way possible; but while we were seated at table in the



evening came a despatch announcing the annihilation of the



Spanish fleet in Cuban waters, and this put us all in good humor.



One circumstance may serve to show the bitterness at heart among



Americans at this period. On entering the dining-hall with our



consul, I noticed two things: first, that the hall was profusely



decorated in a way I had never seen before and had never expected



to see--namely, by intertwined American and British flags; and,



secondly, that there was not a German flag in the room. I



immediately sent for the proprietor and told him that I would not



sit down to dinner until a German flag was brought in. He at



first thought it impossible to supply the want, but, on my



insisting, a large flag was at last found. This was speedily



given a place of honor among the interior decorations of our



hall, and all then went on satisfactorily.







As the war with Spain progressed, various causes of difficulty



arose between Germany and the United States, but I feel bound to



say that the German Government continued to act toward us with



justice. The sensational press, indeed, continued its work on



both sides of the Atlantic. On our side it took pains to secure



and publish stories of insults by the German Admiral Diederichs



to the American Admiral Dewey, and to develop various legends



regarding these two commanders. As a matter of fact, each of the



two admirals, when their relations first began in Manila, was



doubtless rather stiff and on his guard against the other; but



these feelings soon yielded to different sentiments.







The foolish utterances of various individuals, spread by sundry



American papers, were heartily echoed in the German press, the



most noted among these being an alleged after-dinner speech by an



American officer at a New York club, and a Congressional speech



in which the person who made it declared that "the United States,



having whipped Spain, ought now to whip Germany." Still, the



thinking men intrusted with the relations between the two



countries labored on, though at times there must have recurred to



us a sense of the divine inspiration of Schiller's words,



"Against stupidity even the gods fight in vain."







Of course the task of the embassy in protecting American citizens



abroad was especially increased in those times of commotion. At



such periods the number of ways in which American citizens,



native or naturalized, can get into trouble seems infinite; and



here, too, even from the first moment of my arrival in Berlin as



ambassador, I saw evidences of the same evil which had struck me



during my previous missions in Berlin and St. Petersburg--namely,



the constant and ingenious efforts to prostitute American



citizenship. Among the manifold duties of an ambassador is the



granting of passports. The great majority of those who ask for



them are entitled to them; but there are always a considerable



number of persons who, having left Europe just in time to escape



military service, have stayed in America just long enough to



acquire American citizenship, and then, having returned to their



native country, seek to enjoy the advantages of both countries



while discharging the duties of neither. Even worse were the



cases of the descendants of such so-called Americans, most of



them born in Europe and not able even to speak the English



language; worst of all were the cases of sundry



Russians--sometimes stigmatized as "predatory Hebrews"--who,



having left Russia and gone to America, had stayed just long



enough to acquire citizenship, and then returned and settled in



the eastern part of Germany, as near the Russian frontier as



possible. These were naturally regarded as fraudulent interlopers



by both the German and Russian authorities, and much trouble



resulted. Some of them led a life hardly outside the limits of



criminality; but they never hesitated on this account to insist



on their claims to American protection. When they were reminded



that American citizenship was conferred upon them, not that they



might shirk its duties and misuse its advantages in the land of



their birth, but that they might enjoy it and discharge its



duties in the land of their adoption, they scouted the idea and



insisted on their right, as American citizens, to live where they



pleased. Their communications to the embassy were, almost without



exception, in German, Russian, or Polish; very few of them wrote



or even spoke English, and very many of them could neither read



nor write in any language. For the hard-working immigrant,



whether Jew or Gentile, who comes to our country and casts in his



lot with us, to take his share not only of privilege but of duty,



I have the fullest respect and sympathy, and have always been



glad to intervene in his favor; but intervention in behalf of



those fraudulent pretenders I always felt to be a galling burden.







Fortunately the rules of the State Department have been of late



years strengthened to meet this evil, and it has finally become



our practice to inform such people that if they return to America



they can receive a passport for that purpose; but that unless



they show a clear intention of returning, they cannot. Very many



of them persist in their applications in spite of this, and one



case became famous both at the State Department and at the



embassy. Three Russians of the class referred to had emigrated



with their families to America, and, after the usual manner,



stayed just long enough to acquire citizenship, and had then



returned to Germany. One of them committed a crime and



disappeared; the other two went to the extreme eastern frontier



of Prussia and settled there. Again and again the Prussian



Government notified us that under the right exercised by every



nation, and especially by our own, these "undesirable intruders"



must leave Prussian territory or be expelled. Finally we



discovered at the embassy that a secret arrangement had been made



between Germany and Russia which obliged each to return the



undesirable emigrants of the other. This seemed to put the two



families in great danger of being returned to Russia; and, sooner



than risk a new international trouble, a proposal was made to



them, through the embassy, to pay their expenses back to America;



but they utterly refused to leave, and continued to burrow in the



wretched suburbs of one of the German cities nearest the Russian



border. Reams of correspondence ensued--all to no purpose; a



special messenger was sent to influence them--all in vain: they



persisted in living just as near Russia as possible, and in



calling themselves American, though not one of them spoke



English.







From time to time appeared in our own country attacks against the



various American embassies and legations abroad for not



protecting such American citizens, and a very common feature of



these articles was an unfavorable comparison between the United



States and England: it being claimed that Great Britain protects



her citizens everywhere, while the United States does not. This



statement is most misleading. Great Britain, while she is



renowned for protecting her subjects throughout the world,



--bringing the resources of her fleet, if need be, to aid



them,--makes an exception as regards her adopted citizens in the



land of their birth. The person who, having been naturalized in



Great Britain, goes back to the country of his birth, does so at



his or her own risk. The British Government considers itself,



under such circumstances, entirely absolved from the duty of



giving protection. The simple fact is that the United States goes



much further in protecting adopted citizens than does any other



country, and it is only rank demagogism which can find fault



because some of our thinking statesmen do not wish to see



American citizenship prostituted by persons utterly unfit to



receive it, who frequently use it fraudulently, and who, as many



cases prove, are quite ready to renounce it and take up their old



allegiance if they can gain advantage thereby.







Another general duty of the embassy was to smooth the way for the



large number of young men and women who came over as students.



This duty was especially pleasing to me now, as it had been



during my life as minister in Berlin twenty years before. At that



time women were not admitted to the universities; but now large



numbers were in attendance. The university authorities showed



themselves very courteous, and, when there was any doubt as to



the standing of the institution from which a candidate for



admission came, allowed me to pass upon the question and accepted



my certificate. Almost without exception, I found these



candidates excellent; but there were some exceptions. The



applicants were usually persons who had been graduated from some



one of our own institutions; but, from time to time, persons who



had merely passed a freshman year in some little American college



came abroad, anxious to secure the glory of going at once into a



German university. Certificates for such candidates I declined to



sign. To do so would have been an abuse sure to lead the German



authorities finally to reject the great mass of American



students: far better for applicants to secure the best advantages



possible in their own country, and then to supplement their study



at home by proper work abroad.







In sketches of my former mission to Berlin I have mentioned



various applications, some of them psychological curiosities;



these I found continuing, though with variations. Some



compatriots expected me to forward to the Emperor begging



letters, or letters suggesting to him new ideas, unaware that



myriads of such letters are constantly sent which never reach



him, and which even his secretaries never think of reading.



Others sent books, not knowing the rule prevailing among crowned



heads, never to accept a PUBLISHED book, and not realizing that



if this rule were broken, not one book in a thousand would get



beyond the office of his general secretary. Others sent medicine



which they wished him to recommend; and one gentleman was very



persistent in endeavoring to secure his Majesty's decision on a



wager.







Then there were singers or performers on wind or string



instruments wishing to sing or play before him, sculptors and



painters wishing him to visit their studios, and writers of music



wishing him to order their compositions to be brought out at the



Royal Opera.







All these requests culminated in two, wherein the gentle reader



will see a mixture of comic and pathetic. The first was from a



person (not an American) who wished my good offices in enabling



her to obtain a commission for a brilliant marriage,--she having



in reserve, as she assured me, a real Italian duke whom, for a



consideration, she would secure for an American heiress. The



other, which was from an eminently respectable source, urged me



to induce the imperial authorities to station in the United



States a young German officer with whom an American young lady



had fallen in love. And these proposals I was expected to



further, in spite of the fact that the rules for American



representatives abroad forbid all special pleading of any kind in



favor of individual interests or enterprises, without special



instructions from the State Department. Discouraging was it to



find that in spite of the elaborate statement prepared by me



during my former residence, which had been freely circulated



during twenty years, there were still the usual number of people



persuaded that enormous fortunes were awaiting them somewhere in



Germany.







One application, from a truly disinterested man, was grounded in



nobler motives. This was an effort made by an eminent Polish



scholar and patriot to wrest American citizenship for political



purposes. He had been an instructor at various Russian and German



universities had shown in some of his books extraordinary



ability, had gained the friendship of several eminent scholars in



Great Britain and on the Continent, and was finally settled at



one of the most influential seats of learning in Austrian Poland.



He was a most attractive man, wide in his knowledge, charming in



his manner; but not of this world. Having drawn crowds to his



university lectures, he suddenly attacked the Emperor Franz



Josef, who, more than any other, had befriended his compatriots;



was therefore obliged to flee from his post; and now came to



Berlin, proposing seriously that I should at once make him an



American citizen, and thus, as he supposed, enable him to go back



to his university and, in revolutionary speeches, bid defiance to



Austria, Russia, and Germany. Great was his disappointment when



he learned that, in order to acquire citizenship, he would be



obliged to go to the United States and remain there five years.



As he was trying to nerve himself for this sacrifice, I presented



some serious considerations to him. Knowing him to be a man of



honor, I asked him how he could reconcile it with his sense of



veracity to assume the rights of American citizenship with no



intention to discharge its duties. This somewhat startled him.



Then, from a more immediately practical point of view, I showed



that, even if he acquired American citizenship, and could



reconcile his conscience to break the virtual pledge he had made



in order to obtain it, the government of Austria, and, indeed,



all other governments, would still have a full right, under the



simplest principles of international law, to forbid his entrance



into their territories, or to turn him out after he had



entered,--the right of expelling undesirable emigrants being



constantly exercised, even by the United States. This amazed him.



He had absolutely persuaded himself that I could, by some sleight



of hand, transform him into an American citizen; that he could



then at once begin attempts to reestablish the fine old Polish



anarchy in Austria, Russia, and Germany; and that no one of these



nations would dare interfere with him. It was absurd but



pathetic. My advice to him was to go back to his lecture-room and



labor to raise the character of the younger generation of Poles,



in the hope that Poland might do what Scotland had done--rise by



sound mental and moral training from the condition of a conquered



and even oppressed part of a great empire to a controlling



position in it. This advice was, of course, in vain, and he is



now building air-castles amid the fogs of London.







In my life at Berlin as ambassador there was a tinge of sadness.



Great changes had taken place since my student days in that city,



and even since my later stay as minister. A new race of men had



come upon the stage in public affairs, in the university, and in



literary circles. Gone was the old Emperor William, gone also was



the Emperor Frederick, and Bismarck and Moltke and a host of



others who had given dignity and interest to the great



assemblages at the capital. Gone, too, from the university were



Lepsius, Helmholtz, Curtius, Hoffmann, Gneist, Du Bois-Reymond,



and Treitschke, all of whom, in the old days, had been my guests



and friends. The main exceptions seemed to be in the art world.



The number of my artist friends during my stay as minister had



been large, and every one of them was living when I returned as



ambassador; the reason, of course, being that when men



distinguish themselves in art at all, they do so at an earlier



age than do high functionaries of state and professors in the



universities. It was a great pleasure to find Adolf Menzel,



Ludwig Knaus, Carl Beeker, Anton von Werner, and Paul Meyerheim,



though grown gray in their beautiful ministry, still daily at



work in their studios.







Three only of my friends of the older generation in the Berlin



faculty remained; and as I revise these lines the world is laying



tributes upon the grave of the last of them--Theodor Mommsen.



With him my relations were so peculiar that they may deserve some



mention.







During my earlier stays in Berlin he had always seemed especially



friendly to the United States, and it was therefore with regret



that on my return I found him in this respect greatly changed: he



had become a severe critic of nearly everything American; his



earlier expectations had evidently been disappointed; we clearly



appeared to him big, braggart, noisy, false to our principles,



unworthy of our opportunities. These feelings of his became even



more marked as the Spanish-American War drew on. Whenever we met,



and most often at a charming house which both of us frequented,



he showed himself more and more bitter, so that finally our paths



separated. There comes back to me vividly one evening when I



sought to turn off a sharp comment of his upon some recent



American news by saying: "You must give a young nation like ours



more time." On this he exclaimed: "You cannot plead the baby act



any longer. More time! You have HAD time; you are already three



hundred years old!" Having sought in vain to impress on him the



fact that the policy of our country is determined not wholly by



the older elements in its civilization, but very largely by newer



commonwealths which must require time to develop a policy



satisfactory to sedate judges, he burst into a tirade from which



I took refuge in a totally different discussion.







Some days later came another evidence of his feeling. Meeting an



eminent leader in political, and especially in journalistic,



circles, I was shown the corrected proofsheets of an "interview"



on the conduct of the United States toward Spain, given by



Mommsen. It was even more acrid than his previous utterances, and



exhibited sharply and at great length our alleged sins and



shortcomings. Certainly a representative of the American people



was not bound to make supplication, in such a matter, even to so



eminent a scholar and leader of thought, and my comment was



simply as follows: "I have no request to make in the premises--of



Mommsen or of anybody. The article will of course have no effect



on the war; of that there can be but one result: the triumph of



the United States and the liberation of the Spanish islands of



the West Indies; but may there not be some considerations of a



very different order as regards Mommsen himself? Why not ask him,



simply, where his friends are; his readers, his old students, his



disciples? Why not ask him whether he finds fewer clouds over the



policy of Spain than over that of the United States; of which



country, despite all its faults, he has most hope; and for which,



in his heart, he has the greater feeling of brotherhood?"







How far this answer influenced him I know not, but the article



was never published; and thenceforth there seemed some revival of



the older kindly feeling. At my own table and elsewhere he more



than once became, in a measure, like the Mommsen of old. One



utterance of his amused me much. My wife happening, in a talk



with him, to speak of a certain personage as "hardly an ideal



man," he retorted: "Madam, is it possible that you have been



married some years and still believe in the ideal man?"







His old better feeling toward America came out especially when I



next called upon him with congratulations upon his birthday--his



last, alas! But heartiest of all was he during the dinner given



at my departure. My speech was long,--over an hour,--for I had a



message to deliver, and was determined to give it--a message



which I hoped might impress upon my great audience reasons for a



friendly judgment of my country. As I began, Mommsen came to my



side--just back of me, his hand at his ear, listening intently.



There the old man stood from the first word to the last, and on



my conclusion he grasped me heartily with both hands--a



demonstration rare indeed with him. It was our last greeting in



this world.







Would that there were space to dwell upon those in the present



generation of professors who honored me with their friendship;



but one is especially suggested here, since he was selected to



make a farewell address on the occasion above referred to--Adolf



Harnack. At various times I had heard him discourse profoundly



and brilliantly at the university, but came to know him best at



the bicentenary of the Berlin Academy, when he had just added to



the long list of his published works his history of the academy,



in four quarto volumes: a wonderful work, whether considered from



an historical, psychological, or philosophical point of view. His



address on that occasion was masterly, and his conversation at



various social functions instructive and pithy. I remember in one



of them, especially, his delineation of the characteristics and



services of Leibnitz, who was one of the founders of the Royal



Academy, and it was perfection in that kind of conversation which



is worthy of men claiming to possess immortal souls: for it



brought out, especially, examples of Leibnitz's amazing



forethought as to European policy, which seemed at times like



divinely inspired prophecies. He also gave me a number of



interesting things which he had noted in his studies of Frederick



the Great. Some of them I had found already in my own reading,



but one of them I did not remember, and it was both comical and



characteristic. A rural Protestant pastor sent a petition to the



King presenting a grievance and asking redress. It was to the



effect that his church was on one side of a river in Silesia, and



that a younger pastor, whose church was on the opposite side, was



drawing all his parishioners away from him. On the back of the



petition Frederick simply wrote, "Tell him to go and preach on



the other side of the river: that will drive his people back



again."







Hearing Harnack and his leading colleagues in discourse at the



university or academy, or in private, whether in their loftier or



lighter moods, one could understand why the University of Berlin,



though one of the youngest, is the foremost among the



universities of the world.















CHAPTER XLII







AMERICA, GERMANY, AND THE CHINESE WAR--1899-1902







An interesting event of this period was the appearance in Berlin



of ex-President and Mrs. Harrison. The President had but recently



finished his long and wearisome work before the Venezuela



Arbitration Tribunal at Paris, and was very happy in the



consciousness of duty accomplished and liberty obtained. Marks of



high distinction were shown them. The sovereigns invited them to



attend the festivities at Potsdam in honor of the Queen and Queen



Mother of Holland, who were then staying there, and treated them



not only with respect, but with cordiality. The Emperor conversed



long with the President on various matters of public interest: on



noted Americans whom he had met, on the growth of our fleet, on



recent events in our history, and the like, characteristically



ending with a discussion of the superb music which we had been



hearing; and at the supper which followed insisted that Mrs.



Harrison should sit at his side, the Empress giving a similar



invitation to Mr. Harrison. At a later period a dinner was given



to the ex-President by the chancellor of the empire, Prince



Hohenlohe, at which a number of the leading personages in the



empire were present; and it was a pleasure to show my own respect



for the former chief magistrate by a reception which was attended



by about two hundred of our American colony, and a dinner at



which he and Mrs. Harrison made the acquaintance of leading



representative Germans in various fields.







In another chapter of these memoirs I have spoken of President



Harrison as of cold and, at times, abrupt manners; but the



absence of these characteristics during his stay in Berlin, and



afterward in New York, made it clear to me that the cold exterior



which I had noted in him at Washington, especially when Mr.



Roosevelt, Mr. Lodge, and sundry others of us urged upon him an



extension of the classified civil service, was adopted as a means



of preventing encroachments upon the time necessary for his daily



duties. He now appeared in a very different light, his discussion



of men and events showing not only earnest thought and deep



penetration, but a rich vein of humor; his whole bearing being



simple, kindly, and dignified.







During the winter of 1899-1900 came an addition to my experiences



of what American representatives abroad have to expect under our



present happy-go-lucky provision for the diplomatic service. As



already stated, on arriving in Berlin, I had great difficulty in



obtaining any fitting quarters, but at last secured a large and



suitable apartment in an excellent part of the city, its only



disadvantage being that my guests had to plod up seventy-five



steps in order to reach it. Having been obliged to make large



outlays for suitable fittings, extensive repairs, and furniture



throughout, I found that more than the entire salary of my first



year had been thus sunk; but I congratulated myself that I had at



least obtained a residence good, comfortable, and suitable. To be



sure, it was inferior to that of any other ambassador, but I had



fitted it up so that it was considered creditable. Suddenly,



about two years afterward, without a word of warning, came notice



from the proprietor that my lease was void--that he had sold the



house, and that I must leave it; so that it looked as if the



American Embassy would, at an early day, be turned into the



street. This was trying indeed. It was at the beginning of the



social season, and interfered greatly with my duties of every



sort. And there cropped out a feeling, among all conversant with



the case, which I cannot say was conducive to respect for the



wisdom of those who give laws to our country.







But, happily, I had insisted on inserting in the lease a clause



which seemed to make it doubtful whether the proprietor could



turn me out so easily and speedily. Under German law it was a



very precarious reliance, but on this I took my stand, and at



last, thanks mainly to the kindness of my colleague who succeeded



me as a tenant, made a compromise under which I was enabled to



retain the apartment for something over a year longer.







It may be interesting for an American who has a proper feeling



regarding the position of his country abroad to know that the



purchaser of the entire house--not only of the floor which I had



occupied, but of the similar apartment beneath, as well as that



on the ground floor--was the little Grand Duchy of Baden, which



in this way provided for its minister, secretaries, and others



connected with its legation in the German capital.







On the theory of line upon line and precept upon precept, I again



call attention, NOT to the wrong done ME by this American policy,



or rather want of policy,--for I knew in coming what I had to



expect,--but to the injury thus done to the PROPER STANDING OF



OUR COUNTRY BEFORE THE OTHER NATIONS OF THE WORLD. Again I insist



that, in its own interest, a government like ours ought, in every



capital where it is represented, to possess or to hold on long



lease a house or apartment suitable to its representative and



creditable to itself.







Early in the spring of 1900 came an event of some historical



interest. On the 19th of March and the two days following was



celebrated the two-hundredth anniversary of the founding of the



Royal Academy of Sciences. The Emperor, as well as the Academy,



had determined to make it a great occasion, and the result was a



series of very brilliant pageants. These began by a solemn



reception of the delegates from all parts of the world in the



great hall of the palace, my duty being to represent the



Smithsonian Institution at Washington, and my colleagues being



Professors White and Wolf of Harvard, who had been sent by the



American Academy of Sciences. The scene was very striking, all



the delegates, except those from America and Switzerland, being



in the costumes of the organizations they represented; most were



picturesque, and some had a very mediaeval appearance; those from



the ancient universities of Wurzburg and Prague, especially,



looking as if they had just stepped out of an illuminated



manuscript of the fourteenth century. At the time named for the



beginning of the festival the Emperor entered, announced by the



blare of trumpets, preceded by ministers bearing the sword,



standard, and great seal, and by generals bearing the crown,



scepter, and orb. He was surrounded by the highest officials of



the kingdom and empire, and having taken his seat on the throne,



there came majestic music preluding sundry orations and lists of



honors conferred on eminent men of science in all parts of the



world, among whom I was glad to note Professors Gibbs of Yale,



James of Harvard, and Rowland of Johns Hopkins.







The Emperor's speech was characteristic. It showed that his heart



was in the matter; that he felt a just pride in the achievements



of German science, and was determined that no efforts of his



should be wanting to increase and extend them. After the close of



the function, which was made in the same stately way as its



beginning, my colleagues drove home with me, and one of them



said, "Well, I am an American and a republican, but when I am in



a monarchy I like to see a thing of this kind done in the most



magnificent way possible, as it was this morning." A day or two



afterward, at the dinner given to the ambassadors by the Emperor,



I told him this story. He laughed heartily, and then said: "Your



friend is right: if a man is to be a monarch, let him be a



monarch; Dom Pedro of Brazil tried to be something else, and it



did not turn out well."







Impressive in a different way were the ceremonies attendant upon



the coming of age of the German crown prince, on the 6th of May,



1900. To do honor to the occasion, the Emperor Franz Josef of



Austria-Hungary had sent word that he would be present, and for



many days the whole city seemed mainly devoted to decorating its



buildings and streets for his visit; the culmination of the whole



being at the Pariser Platz, in front of the Brandenburg Gate,



where a triumphal arch and obelisks were erected, with other



decorations, patriotic and complimentary. On the morning of the



4th he arrived, and, entering the city at the side of the German



Emperor, each in the proper uniform of the other, he was received



by the burgomaster and town council of Berlin with a most cordial



speech, and then, passing on through the Linden, which was



showily decorated, he was enthusiastically greeted everywhere. No



doubt this greeting was thoroughly sincere, since all good



Germans look upon Franz Josef as their truest ally.







Next evening there was a "gala" performance at the Royal Opera,



the play presented being, of all things in the world, Auber's



"Bronze Horse," which is a farcical Chinese fairy tale set to



very light and pleasing music. The stage setting was gorgeous,



but the audience was still more so, delegates from all the



greater powers of the world being present, including the heirs to



the British and Italian thrones, the Grand Duke Constantine of



Russia, and a multitude of other scions of royalty. One feature



was comical. Near me sat His Excellency the Chinese minister,



surrounded by his secretaries and attaches, all apparently



delighted; and on my asking him, through his interpreter, how he



liked it, he said, "Very much; this shows the Europeans that in



China we know how to amuse ourselves." Of the fact that it was a



rather highly charged caricature of Chinese officialdom he seemed



either really or diplomatically unconscious.







On the following morning I was received in audience by the German



Emperor, bringing to him a warm message of congratulation from



President McKinley; and when His Majesty had replied very



cordially, he introduced me to the crown prince standing at his



side, to whom I gave the President's best wishes. Then came, in



the chapel of the palace, an impressive religious service, the



address by Dr. Dryander being eloquent, and the music, by the



cathedral choir and, at times, by a great military orchestra,



both far above us in the dome, beautiful. At its close the crown



prince came forward, stood before the altar, where I had seen his



parents married twenty years before, and the oath of allegiance,



which was quite long, having been read to him by the colonel of



his regiment, he repeated it, word for word, and made his solemn



pledge, lifting one hand and grasping the imperial standard with



the other. Then, after receiving affectionate embraces from his



father and mother, he was congratulated by the sovereigns and



royal personages. The ambassadors and ministers having been then



received by the Emperor and Empress, the young prince came along



the line and spoke to each of us in a very unaffected and manly



way. He was at that time somewhat taller than his father, with an



intelligent and pleasant face, and is likely, I should say, to do



well in his great position, though not possessing, probably,



anything like his father's varied gifts and graces.







In the evening came a dinner in the White Hall of the palace to



several hundred guests, including the Emperor of Austria-Hungary,



the King of Saxony, and other visiting personages, with the heads



of the diplomatic missions, and the leading personages of the



empire; and near the close of it the Emperor William arose and



made an excellent speech, to all appearance extemporaneous. The



answer by the Emperor of Austria-Hungary was read by him, and was



sensible and appropriate.







That this visit did much to strengthen the ties which bind the



two monarchies was shown not merely by hurrahs in the streets and



dithyrambic utterances in the newspapers, but by a mass of other



testimony. One curious thing was the great care everywhere taken



in the decorations to honor the crown and flag of Hungary equally



with that of Austria, and this, as was shown by the Hungarian



journals, had an excellent effect. By this meeting, no doubt, the



Triple Alliance was somewhat strengthened, and the chances for



continued peace increased, at least during the lifetime of the



Emperor Franz Josef. As to what will follow his death all is



dark. His successor is one of the least suitable of



men,--unprepossessing, and even forbidding, in every respect.



Brought up by the Jesuits, he is distrusted by a vast mass of the



best people in the empire, Catholic and Protestant. A devout



Catholic they would be glad to take, but a Jesuit pupil they



dread, for they know too well what such have brought upon the



empire hitherto, and, indeed, upon every kingdom which has



allowed them in its councils. His previous career has not been



edifying, and there is no reason to expect any change in him. The



Emperor Franz Josef is probably as thoroughly beloved by his



subjects as any sovereign in history has ever been. His great



misfortunes--fearful defeats in the wars with France and Germany,



the suicide of his only son, the assassination of his wife, and



family troubles in more recent times--have thrown about him an



atmosphere of romantic sympathy; while love for his kindly



qualities is mingled with respect for his plain common sense.



During his stay in Berlin I met him a second time. At my first



presentation at Dresden, two years before, there was little



opportunity for extended conversation; but he now spoke quite at



length and in a manner which showed him to be observant of the



world's affairs even in remote regions. He discussed the recent



increase of our army, the progress of our war in the Philippines,



and the extension of American enterprise in various parts of the



world, in a way which was not at all perfunctory, but evidently



the result of large information and careful observation. His



empire, which is a seething caldron of hates, racial, religious,



political, and local, is held together by love and respect for



him; but when he dies this personal tie which unites all these



different races, parties, and localities will disappear, and in



place of it will come the man who by force of untoward



circumstances is to be his successor, and this is anything but a



pleasing prospect to an Austro-Hungarian, or, indeed, to any



thoughtful observer of human affairs.







Interesting to me at this period was a visit from representatives



of the "Kriegerverein"--German-Americans who had formerly fought



in the war between Germany and France, who had since become



American citizens, and who were now revisiting their native land.



They were a very manly body, evidently taking pride in the



American flag which they carried, and also in the part they had



played in Germany. Replying to a friendly address by their



commanding officer, I took up some current American fallacies



regarding Germany and Germans, encouraged my hearers to stand



firm against sensational efforts to make trouble between the two



countries, urged them to keep their children in knowledge of the



German language and in touch with German civilization, while



bringing them up as thoroughly loyal Americans, reminding them



that every American who is interested in German history or



literature or science or art is an additional link in the chain



which binds together the two nations. The speech was of a very



offhand sort; but it seemed to strike deep and speed far, for it



evoked most kindly letters of congratulation and thanks from



various parts of Germany and the United States.







The most striking episode in the history of the world during



these years was the revolution in China. The first event which



startled mankind was the murder of Baron von Ketteler, the German



minister at Peking, a man of remarkable abilities and



accomplishments, who was thought sure to rise high among



diplomatists, and who had especially attracted American



friendships by his marriage with an American lady. The impression



created by this calamity was made all the greater by the fact



that, in the absence of further news from the Chinese capital,



there was reason to fear that the whole diplomatic corps, with



their families, might be murdered. American action in the



entanglements which followed was prompt and successful, and



thinking men everywhere soon saw it to be so. Toward the end of



July, 1900, being about to go to America for the summer, I took



leave of Count von Bulow at the Foreign Office, and, on coming



out, met one of my colleagues, who, although representing one of



the lesser European powers, was well known as exceedingly shrewd



and far-sighted. He said: "I congratulate you on the course



pursued by your government during this fearful Chinese imbroglio.



Other powers have made haste to jump into war; your admiral at



Tientsin seems the only one who has kept his head; other



governments have treated representatives of the Chinese Empire as



hostile, and, in doing so, have cut themselves off from all



direct influence on the Peking Government; the government at



Washington has taken an opposite course, has considered the



troubles as, prima facie, the work of insurrectionists, has



insisted on claiming friendship with the constituted authorities



in China, and, in view of this friendship, has insisted on being



kept in communication with its representative at the Chinese



capital, the result being that your government has been allowed



to communicate with its representative, and has thereby gained



the information and issued the orders which have saved the entire



diplomatic corps, as well as the forces of the different powers



now in Peking."







It was one of those contemporary testimonies to the skill of Mr.



McKinley and Secretary Hay which indicate the verdict of history.







Our later policy was equally sound. It was to prevent any further



territorial encroachments on China by foreign powers, and to



secure the opening of the empire on equal terms to the commerce



of the entire world. On the other hand, the German Government,



exasperated by the murder of its minister at Peking, was at first



inclined to go beyond this, and a speech of the Emperor to his



troops as they were leaving Germany for the seat of war was



hastily construed to mean that they were to carry out a policy of



extermination and confiscation. Even after the first natural



outburst of indignation against the Chinese, it looked as if the



ultimatum presented by the powers would include demands which



could never be met, and would entangle all the powers in a long



and tedious war, leading, perhaps, to a worse catastrophe.



Quietly but vigorously, from first to last, the American policy



was urged by Mr. Conger, American minister at Peking, and by



other representatives of our government abroad; and it was a



happy morning for me when, after efforts many and long continued,



I received at the Berlin Foreign Office the assurance that



Germany would not consider the earlier conditions presented by



the powers to the Chinese Government as "irrevocable." My



constant contention, during interviews at the Foreign Office, had



been that the United States desired as anxiously to see the main



miscreants punished as did any other nation, but that it was of



no use to demand, upon members of the imperial family, and upon



generals in command of great armies, extreme penalties which the



Chinese Government was not strong enough to inflict, or



indemnities which it was not rich enough to pay; that our aim was



not quixotic but practical, and that, in advocating steadily the



"open door" policy, we were laboring quite as much for all other



powers as for ourselves. Of course we were charged in various



quarters with cold-bloodedness, and with merely seeking to



promote our own interest in trade; but the Japanese, who could



understand the question better than the Western powers, steadily



adhered to our policy, and more and more, in its main lines, it



proved to be correct.







On the Fourth of July, 1900, came the celebration of our national



independence at Leipsic, and being asked to respond to the first



regular toast, and, having at my former visit dwelt especially



upon the Presidency, my theme now became the character and



services of the President himself, and it was a pleasure to find



that my statement was received by the German press in a way that



showed a reaction from previous injustice.







During August and September preceding the political campaign



which resulted in Mr. McKinley's reelection I was in the United



States. It was the hottest summer in very many years, and



certainly, within my whole experience, there had been no torrid



heat like that during my visits to Washington. Nearly every one



seemed prostrated by it. Upon arriving at the Arlington Hotel, I



found two old friends unnerved by the temperature, one of them



not daring to risk a sunstroke by going to the train which would



take him to his home in Chicago Retiring to one's room at night,



even in the best-situated hotels, was like entering an oven. The



leading official persons were generally absent, and those who



remained seemed hardly capable of doing business. But there was



one exception. Going to the White House to pay my respects to the



President, I found him the one man in Washington perfectly cool,



serene, and unaffected by the burning heat or by the pressure of



public affairs. Although matters in Cuba, in Porto Rico, in the



Philippines in China, and in the political campaign then going on



must have been constantly in his mind, he had plenty of time,



seemed to take trouble about nothing, and kept me in his office



for a full hour, discussing calmly the various phases of the



situation as they were affected by matters in Germany.







His discussion of public affairs showed the same quiet insight



and strength which I had recognized in him when we first met, in



1884, as delegates at the Chicago National Convention. One thing



during this Washington interview struck me especially: I asked



him if he was to make any addresses during the campaign; he



answered: "No; several of my friends have urged me to do so, but



I shall not. I intend to return to what seems to me the better



policy of the earlier Presidents: the American people have my



administration before them; they have ample material for judging



it, and with them I shall silently leave the whole matter." He



said this in a perfectly simple, quiet way, which showed that he



meant what he said. At the time I regretted his decision; but it



soon became clear that he was right.







At the beginning of the year 1901 came the two-hundredth



anniversary of the founding of the Prussian kingdom.



Representatives of the other governments of the world appeared at



court in full force; and, under instructions from the President,



I tendered his congratulations and best wishes to the monarch, as



follows:







May it please Your Majesty: I am instructed by the President to



present his hearty congratulations on this two-hundredth



anniversary of the founding of the Kingdom of Prussia, and, with



his congratulations, his best wishes for Your Majesty's health



and happiness, as well as the health and happiness of the Royal



Family, and his earnest hopes for the continued prosperity of



Your Majesty's Kingdom and Empire.







At the same time I feel fully authorized to present similar



congratulations and good wishes from the whole people of the



United States. The ties between the two nations, instead of being



weakened by time, have constantly grown stronger. As regards



material interests they are bound together by an enormous



commerce, growing greatly every year: as regards deeper



sentiments, no man acquainted with American History forgets that



the House of Hohenzollern was one of the first European powers to



recognize American Independence; and that it was Frederick the



Great who made that first treaty,--a landmark in the history of



International Law,--the only fault of which was that the world



was not far enough advanced to appreciate it. We also remember



that Germany was the only foreign country which showed decided



sympathy for us during our Civil War--the second struggle for our



national existence.







I also feel fully authorized, in view of Your Majesty's interest



in everything that ministers to the highest interests of



civilization, to express thanks for service which the broad



policy of Germany has rendered the United States in throwing open



to American scholars its Universities, its Technical Schools, its



conservatories of Art, its Museums, and its Libraries. Every



University and advanced school of learning in the United States



recognizes the fact that Germany has been our main foreign



teacher, as regards the higher ranges of Science, Literature, and



Art, and I may be allowed to remind Your Majesty, that while



Great Britain is justly revered by us as our mother country



Germany is beginning to hold to us a similar relation, not only



as the fatherland of a vast number of American citizens, but as



one of the main sources of the intellectual culture spread by our



universities and schools for advanced learning.







Allow me, then, sir, to renew the best wishes of the President



and people of the United States, with their hopes that ever



blessing may attend Your Majesty, the House of Hohenzollern the



Kingdom of Prussia, and the German Empire.











The Emperor in his reply spoke very cordially of the President's



special telegram, which he had received that morning, and then



gave earnest utterance to his belief that the time is coming when



the three great peoples of Germanic descent will stand firmly



together in all the great questions of the world.







The religious ceremonies in the Palace Chapel, with magnificent



music; the banquet, which included pertinent speeches from the



monarchs; and the gala representation at the opera all passed off



well: but, perhaps, that which will dwell longest in my memory



took place at the last. The performance consisted of two pieces:



one a poem glorifying Prussia, recited with music; the other a



play, in four acts, with long, musical interludes, deifying the



great Elector and the house of Hohenzollern. Though splendid in



scenic setting and brilliant in presentation it was very long,



and the ambassadors' box was crowded and hot. In the midst of it



all the French ambassador, the Marquis de Noailles, one of the



most suave courteous, and placid of men, quietly said to me, with



inimitable gravity, "What a bore this must be to those who



understand German! (Comme ca doit etre ennuyeux a ceux qui



correprennent l'Allexnand!)" This sudden revelation of a lower



depth of boredom--from one who could not understand a word of the



play--was worthy of his ancestors in the days of Saint-Simon and



Dangeau.







During the following summer two great sorrows befell me and mine,



but there is nothing to be here chronicled save that in this, as



in previous trials, I took refuge in work which seemed to be



worthy. The diplomatic service in summer is not usually exacting,



especially when one has, as I had, thoroughly loyal and judicious



embassy secretaries. As in a former bereavement I had turned to a



study of the character and services of John of Portugal and his



great successors in the age of discovery, so now I turned to Fra



Paolo Sarpi and the good fight he fought for Venice and humanity.



To my large collection of books on the subject, made mainly in



Italy, I added much from the old book-shops of Germany, and with



these revised my Venetian studies. An old dream of mine had been



to bring out a small book on Fra Paolo: now I sought, more



modestly, to prepare an essay.[6] The work was good for me.



Contemplation of that noblest of the three great Italians between



the Renaissance and the Resurrection of Italy did something to



lift me above sorrow; reading his words, uttered so calmly in all



the storm and stress of his time, soothed me. Viewed from my



work-table on the island of Rugen, the world became less dark as



I thought upon this hero of three centuries ago.

of January and February, 1904.

FRA PAOLO SARPI.







I.







A thoughtful historian tells us that, between the fourteenth



century and the nineteenth, Italy produced three great men. As



the first of these, he names Machiavelli, who, he says, "taught



the world to understand political despotism and to hate it;" as



the second, he names Sarpi who "taught the world after what



manner the Holy Spirit guides the Councils of the Church;" and as



the third, Galileo, who "taught the world what dogmatic theology



is worth when it can be tested by science."







I purpose now to present the second of these. As a MAN, he was by



far the greatest of the three and, in various respects, the most



interesting, for he not only threw a bright light into the most



important general council of the Church and revealed to



Christendom the methods which there prevailed,--in a book which



remains one of the half-dozen classic histories of the



world,--but he fought the most bitter fight for humanity against



the papacy ever known in any Latin nation, and won a victory by



which the whole world has profited ever since. Moreover, he was



one of the two foremost Italian statesmen since the Middle Ages,



the other being Cavour.







He was born at Venice in 1552, and it may concern those who care



to note the subtle interweaving of the warp and woof of history



that the birth year of this most resourceful foe that Jesuitism



ever had was the death year of St. Francis Xavier, the noblest of



Jesuit apostles.







It may also interest those who study the more evident evolution



of cause and effect in human affairs to note that, like most



strong men, he had a strong mother; that while his father was a



poor shopkeeper who did little and died young, his mother was



wise and serene.







From his earliest boyhood, he showed striking gifts and



characteristics. He never forgot a face once seen, could take in



the main contents of a page at a glance, spoke little, rarely ate



meat, and, until his last years, never drank wine.







Brought up, after the death of his father, first by his uncle, a



priest, and then by Capella, a Servite monk, in something better



than the usual priestly fashion, he became known, while yet in



his boyhood, as a theological prodigy. Disputations in his youth,



especially one at Mantua, where, after the manner of the time, he



successfully defended several hundred theses against all comers,



attracted wide attention, so that the Bishop gave him a



professorship, and the Duke, who, like some other crowned heads



of those days,--notably Henry VIII. and James I.,--liked to



dabble in theology, made him a court theologian. But the duties



of this position were uncongenial: a flippant duke, fond of



putting questions which the wisest theologian could not answer,



and laying out work which the young scholar evidently thought



futile, apparently wearied him. He returned to the convent of the



Servites at Venice, and became, after a few years' novitiate, a



friar, changing, at the same time, his name; so that, having been



baptized Peter, he now became Paul.







His career soon seemed to reveal another and underlying cause of



his return: he evidently felt the same impulse which stirred his



contemporaries, Lord Bacon and Galileo; for he began devoting



himself to the whole range of scientific and philosophical



studies, especially to mathematics, physics, astronomy, anatomy,



and physiology. In these he became known as an authority, and



before long was recognized as such through out Europe. It is



claimed, and it is not improbable, that he anticipated Harvey in



discovering the circulation of the blood, and that he was the



forerunner of noted discoveries in magnetism. Unfortunately the



loss of the great mass of his papers by the fire which destroyed



his convent in 1769 forbids any full estimate of his work; but it



is certain that among those who sought his opinion and advice



were such great discoverers as Acquapendente, Galileo,



Torricelli, and Gilbert of Colchester, and that every one of



these referred to him as an equal, and indeed as a master. It



seems also established that it was he who first discovered the



valves of the veins, that he made known the most beautiful



function of the iris,--its contractility,--and that various



surmises of his regarding heat, light, and sound have since been



developed into scientific truths. It is altogether likely that,



had he not been drawn from scientific pursuits by his duties as a



statesman, he would have ranked among the greater investigators



and discoverers, not only of Italy, but of the world.







He also studied political and social problems, and he arrived at



one conclusion which, though now trite, was then novel,--the



opinion that the aim of punishment should not be vengeance, but



reformation. In these days and in this country, where one of the



most serious of evils is undue lenity to crime, this opinion may



be imputed to him as a fault; but in those days, when torture was



the main method in procedure and in penalty, his declaration was



honorable both to his head and heart.







With all his devotion to books, he found time to study men. Even



at school, he had seemed to discern those who would win control.



They discerned something in him also; so that close relations



were formed between him and such leaders as Contarini and



Morosini, with whom he afterwards stood side by side in great



emergencies.







Important missions were entrusted to him. Five times he visited



Rome to adjust perplexing differences between the papal power and



various interests at Venice. He was rapidly advanced through most



of the higher offices in his order, and in these he gave a series



of decisions which won the respect of all entitled to form an



opinion.







Naturally he was thought of for high place in the Church, and was



twice presented for a bishopric; but each time he was rejected at



Rome,--partly from family claims of less worthy candidates,



partly from suspicions regarding his orthodoxy. It was objected



that he did not find the whole doctrine of the Trinity in the



first verse of Genesis, that he corresponded with eminent



heretics of England and Germany, that he was not averse to



reforms, that, in short, he was not inclined to wallow in the



slime from which had crawled forth such huge incarnations of evil



as John XXIII., Julius II., Sixtus IV., and Alexander VI.







His orthodox detractors have been wont to represent him as



seeking vengeance for his non-promotion; but his after career



showed amply that personal grievances had little effect upon him.



It is indeed not unlikely that when he saw bishoprics for which



he knew himself well fitted given as sops to poor creatures



utterly unfit in morals or intellect, he may have had doubts



regarding the part taken by the Almighty in selecting them; but



he was reticent, and kept on with his work. In his cell at Santa



Fosca, he quietly and steadily devoted himself to his cherished



studies; but he continued to study more than books or inanimate



nature. He was neither a bookworm nor a pedant. On his various



missions he met and discoursed with churchmen and statesmen



concerned in the greatest transactions of his time, notably at



Mantua with Oliva, secretary of one of the greatest ecclesiastics



at the Council of Trent; at Milan with Cardinal Borromeo, by far



the noblest of all who sat in that assemblage during its eighteen



years; in Rome and elsewhere with Arnauld Ferrier, who had been



French Ambassador at the Council, Cardinal Severina, head of the



Inquisition, Castagna, afterward Pope Urban VII., and Cardinal



Bellarmine, afterward Sarpi's strongest and noblest opponent.







Nor was this all. He was not content with books or conversations;



steadily he went on collecting, collating, and testing original



documents bearing upon the great events of his time. The result



of all this the world was to see later.







He had arrived at middle life and won wide recognition as a



scholar, scientific investigator, and jurist, when there came the



supreme moment of a struggle which had involved Europe for



centuries,--a struggle interesting not only the Italy and Europe



of those days, but universal humanity for all time.







During the period following the fall of the Roman Empire of the



West there had been evolved the temporal power of the Roman



Bishop. It had many vicissitudes. Sometimes, as in the days of



St. Leo and St. Gregory, it based its claims upon noble



assertions of right and justice, and sometimes, as in the hands



of pontiffs like Innocent VIII. and Paul V., it sought to force



its way by fanaticism. Sometimes it strengthened its authority by



real services to humanity, and sometimes by such monstrous frauds



as the Forged Decretals. Sometimes, as under Popes like Gregory



VII. and Innocent III., it laid claim to the mastership of the



world, and sometimes, as with the majority of the pontiffs during



the two centuries before the Reformation, it became mainly the



appanage of a party or faction or family.







Throughout all this history, there appeared in the Church two



great currents of efficient thought. On one side had been



developed a theocratic theory, giving the papacy a power supreme



in temporal as well as in spiritual matters throughout the world.



Leaders in this during the Middle Ages were St. Thomas Aquinas



and the Dominicans; leaders in Sarpi's days were the Jesuits,



represented especially in the treatises of Bellarmine at Rome and



in the speeches of Laynez at the Council of Trent.[1]











[1] This has been admirably shown by N. R. F. Brown in his



Taylorian Lecture, pages 229-234, in volume for 1889-99.











But another theory, hostile to the despotism of the Church over



the State, had been developed through the Middle Ages and the



Renaissance;--it had been strengthened mainly by the utterances



of such men as Dante, aegidio Colonna, John of Paris, Ockham,



Marsilio of Padua, and Laurentius Valla. Sarpi ranged himself



with the latter of these forces. Though deeply religious, he



recognized the God-given right of earthly governments to



discharge their duties independent of church control.







Among the many centres of this struggle was Venice. She was



splendidly religious--as religion was then understood. She was



made so by her whole environment. From the beginning she had been



a seafaring power, and seafaring men, from their constant wrestle



with dangers ill understood, are prone to seek and find



supernatural forces. Nor was this all. Later, when she had become



rich, powerful, luxurious, licentious, and refractory to the



priesthood, her most powerful citizens felt a need of atoning for



their many sins by splendid religious foundations. So her people



came to live in an atmosphere of religious observance, and the



bloom and fruitage of their religious hopes and fears are seen in



the whole history of Venetian art,--from the rude sculptures of



Torcello and the naive mosaics of San Marco to the glowing



altarpieces and ceilings of John Bellini, Titian, and Tintoretto



and the illuminations of the Grimani Psalter. No class in Venice



rose above this environment. Doges and Senators were as



susceptible to it as were the humblest fishermen on the Lido. In



every one of those glorious frescoes in the corridors and halls



of the Ducal Palace which commemorate the victories of the



Republic, the triumphant Doge or Admiral or General is seen on



his knees making acknowledgment of the divine assistance. On



every Venetian sequin, from the days when Venice was a power



throughout the earth to that fatal year when the young Bonaparte



tossed the Republic over to the House of Austria, the Doge,



crowned and robed, kneels humbly before the Saviour, the Virgin,



or St. Mark. In that vast Hall of the Five Hundred, the most



sumptuous room in the world, there is spread above the heads of



the Doge and Senators and Councilors, as an incentive to the



discharge of their duties on earth, a representation of the



blessed in Heaven.







From highest to lowest, the Venetians lived, moved, and had their



being in this religious environment, and, had their Republic been



loosely governed, its external policy would have been largely



swayed by this all-pervading religious feeling, and would have



become the plaything of the Roman Court. But a democracy has



never been maintained save by the delegation of great powers to



its chosen leaders. It was the remark of one of the foremost



American Democrats of the nineteenth century, a man who received



the highest honors which his party could bestow, that the



Constitution of the United States was made, not to promote



Democracy, but to check it. This statement is true, and it is as



true of the Venetian Constitution as of the American.[1]











[1] See Horatio Seymour's noted article in the North American



Review.











But while both the republics recognized the necessity of curbing



Democracy, the difference between the means employed was



world-wide. The founders of the American Republic gave vast



powers and responsibilities to a president and unheard-of



authority to a supreme court; in the Venetian Republic the Doge



was gradually stripped of power, but there was evolved the



mysterious and unlimited authority of the Senate and Council of



Ten.







In these sat the foremost Venetians, thoroughly imbued with the



religious spirit of their time; but, religious as they were, they



were men of the world, trained in the polities of all Europe and



especially of Italy.







In a striking passage, Guizot has shown how the Crusaders who



went to the Orient by way of Italy and saw the papacy near at



hand came back skeptics. This same influence shaped the statesmen



of Venice. The Venetian Ambassadors were the foremost in Europe.



Their Relations are still studied as the clearest, shrewdest, and



wisest statements regarding the men and events in Europe at their



time. All were noted for skill; but the most skillful were kept



on duty at Rome. There was the source of danger. The Doges,



Senators, and controlling Councilors had, as a rule, served in



these embassies, and they had formed lucid judgments as to



Italian courts in general and as to the Roman Court in



particular. No men had known the Popes and the Curia more



thoroughly. They had seen Innocent VIII. buy the papacy for



money. They had been at the Vatican when Alexander VI. had won



renown as a secret murderer. They had seen, close at hand, the



merciless cruelty of Julius II. They had carefully noted the



crimes of Sixtus IV., which culminated in the assassination of



Julian de' Medici beneath the dome of Florence at the moment the



Host was uplifted. They had sat near Leo X. while he enjoyed the



obscenities of the Calandria and the Mandragora,--plays which, in



the most corrupt of modern cities, would, in our day, be stopped



by the police. No wonder that, in one of their dispatches, they



speak of Rome as "the cloaca of the world."[1]











[1] For Sixtus IV. and his career, with the tragedy in the



Cathedral of Florence see Villari's Life of Machiavelli, English



Edition, vol. ii. pp. 341, 342. For the passages in the



dispatches referred to, vide ibid. vol. i. p. 198.











Naturally, then, while their religion showed itself in wonderful



monuments of every sort, their practical sense was shown by a



steady opposition to papal encroachments.







Of this combination of zeal for religion with hostility to



ecclesiasticism we have striking examples throughout the history



of the Republic. While, in every other European state, cardinals,



bishops, priests, and monks were given leading parts in civil



administration and, in some states, a monopoly of civil honors,



the Republic of Venice not only excluded all ecclesiastics from



such posts, but, in cases which touched church interests, she



excluded even the relatives of ecclesiastics. When church



authority decreed that commerce should not be maintained with



infidels and heretics, the Venetian merchants continued to deal



with Turks, Pagans, Germans, Englishmen, and Dutchmen as before.



When the Church decreed that the taking of interest for money was



sin, and great theologians published in Venice some of their



mightiest treatises demonstrating this view from Holy Scripture



and the Fathers, the Venetians continued borrowing and lending



money on usance. When efforts were made to enforce that



tremendous instrument for the consolidation of papal power, the



bull In Coena Domini, Venice evaded and even defied it. When the



Church frowned upon anatomical dissections, the Venetians allowed



Andreas Vesalius to make such dissections at their University of



Padua. When Sixtus V., the strongest of all the Popes, had



brought all his powers, temporal and spiritual, to bear against



Henry IV. of France as an excommunicated heretic, and seemed



ready to hurl the thunderbolts of the Church against any power



which should recognize him, the Venetian Republic not only



recognized him, but treated his Ambassador with especial



courtesy. When the other Catholic powers, save France, yielded to



papal mandates and sent no representatives to the coronation of



James I. of England, Venice was there represented. When Pope



after Pope issued endless diatribes against the horrors of



toleration, the Venetians steadily tolerated in their several



sorts of worship Jews and Greeks, Mohammedans and Armenians, with



Protestants of every sort who came to them on business. When the



Roman Index forbade the publication of most important works of



leading authors, Venice demanded and obtained for her printers



rights which were elsewhere denied.







As to the religious restrictions which touched trade, the



Venetians in the public councils, and indeed the people at large,



had come to know perfectly what the papal theory meant,--with



some of its promoters, fanaticism, but with the controlling power



at Rome, revenue, revenue to be derived from retailing



dispensations to infringe the holy rules.







This peculiar antithesis--nowhere more striking than at Venice,



on the one side, religious fears and hopes; on the other, keen



insight into the ways of ecclesiasticism--led to peculiar



compromises. The bankers who had taken interest upon money, the



merchants who had traded with Moslems and heretics, in their last



hours frequently thought it best to perfect their title to



salvation by turning over large estates to the Church. Under the



sway of this feeling, and especially of the terrors infused by



priests at deathbeds, mortmain had become in Venice, as in many



other parts of the world, one of the most serious of evils. Thus



it was that the clergy came to possess between one fourth and one



third of the whole territory of the Republic, and in its Bergamo



district more than one half; and all this was exempt from



taxation. Hence it was that the Venetian Senate found it



necessary to devise a legal cheek which should make such



absorption of estates by the Church more and more difficult.







There was a second cause of trouble. In that religious atmosphere



of Venice, monastic orders of every sort grew luxuriantly, not



only absorbing more and more land to be held by the dead hand,



thus escaping the public burdens, but ever absorbing more and



more men and women, and thus depriving the state of any healthy



and normal service from them. Here, too, the Senate thought it



best to interpose a check: it insisted that all new structures



for religious orders must be authorized by the State.







Yet another question flamed forth. Of the monks of every sort



swarming through the city, many were luxurious and some were



criminal. On these last, the Venetian Senate determined to lay



its hands, and in the first years of the seventeenth century all



these questions, and various other matters distasteful to the



Vatican, culminated in the seizure and imprisonment of two



ecclesiastics charged with various high crimes,--among these rape



and murder.







There had just come to the papal throne Camillo Borghese, Paul



V.,--strong, bold, determined, with the highest possible theory



of his duties and of his position. In view of his duty toward



himself, he lavished the treasures of the faithful upon his



family, until it became the richest which had yet risen in Rome;



in view of his duty toward the Church, he built superbly, and an



evidence of the spirit in which he wrought is his name, in



enormous letters, still spread across the facade of St. Peter's.



As to his position, he accepted fully the theories and practices



of his boldest predecessors, and in this he had good warrant; for



St. Thomas Aquinas and Bellarmine had furnished him with



convincing arguments that he was divinely authorized to rule the



civil powers of Italy and of the world.[1]











[1] For details of these cases of the two monks, see Pascolato.



Fra Paolo Sarpi, Milano, 1893, pp. 126-128. For the Borghese



avarice, see Ranke's Popes, vol. iii. pp. 9-20. For the



development of Pope Paul's theory of government, see Ranke, vol.



ii. p. 345, and note in which Bellarmine's doctrine is cited



textually; also Bellarmine's Selbstbiographie, herausgegeben von



Dollinger und Rensch Bonn, 1887. pp. 181, et seq.











Moreover there was, in his pride, something akin to fanaticism.



He had been elected by one of those sudden movements, as well



known in American caucuses as in papal conclaves, when, after a



deadlock, all the old candidates are thrown over, and the choice



suddenly falls on a new man. The cynical observer may point to



this as showing that the laws governing elections, under such



circumstances, are the same, whether in party caucuses or in



church councils; but Paul, in this case, saw the direct



intervention of the Almighty, and his disposition to magnify his



office was vastly increased thereby. He was especially strenuous,



and one of his earliest public acts was to send to the gallows a



poor author, who, in an unpublished work, had spoken severely



regarding one of Paul's predecessors.







The Venetian laws checking mortmain, taxing church property, and



requiring the sanction of the Republic before the erection of new



churches and monasteries greatly angered him; but the crowning



vexation was the seizure of the two clerics. This aroused him



fully. He at once sent orders that they be delivered up to him,



that apology be made for the past and guarantees given for the



future, and notice was served that, in case the Republic did not



speedily obey these orders, the Pope would excommunicate its



leaders and lay an interdict upon its people. It was indeed a



serious contingency. For many years the new Pope had been known



as a hard, pedantic ecclesiastical lawyer, and now that he had



arrived at the supreme power, he had evidently determined to



enforce the high mediaeval supremacy of the Church over the



State. Everything betokened his success. In France he had broken



down all opposition to the decrees of the Council of Trent. In



Naples, when a magistrate had refused to disobey the civil law at



the bidding of priests, and the viceroy had supported the



magistrate, Pope Paul had forced the viceroy and magistrate to



comply with his will by threats of excommunication. In every part



of Italy,--in Malta, in Savoy, in Parma, in Lucca, in Genoa,--and



finally even in Spain, he had pettifogged, bullied, threatened,



until his opponents had given way. Everywhere he was triumphant;



and while he was in the mood which such a succession of triumphs



would give he turned toward Venice.[1]

Spain at this time, see Cornet, Paolo V. e la Republica Veneta,



Vienna, 1859, p. 285.











There was little indeed to encourage the Venetians to resist;



for, while the interests of other European powers were largely



the same as theirs, current political intrigues seemed likely to



bring Spain and even France into a league with the Vatican.







To a people so devoted to commerce, yet so religious, the threat



of an interdict was serious indeed. All church services were to



cease; the people at large, no matter how faithful, were to be as



brute beasts,--not to be legally married, --not to be consoled by



the sacraments, --not to be shriven, and virtually not to be



buried; other Christian peoples were to be forbidden all dealings



with them, under pain of excommunication; their commerce was to



be delivered over to the tender mercies of any and every other



nation; their merchant ships to be as corsairs; their cargoes,



the legitimate prey of all Christendom; and their people, on sea



and land, to be held as enemies of the human race. To this was



added, throughout the whole mass of the people, a vague sense of



awful penalties awaiting them in the next world. Despite all



this, the Republic persisted in asserting its right.







Just at this moment came a diplomatic passage between Pope and



Senate like a farce before a tragedy, and it has historical



significance, as showing what resourceful old heads were at the



service of either side. The Doge Grimani having died, the Vatican



thought to score a point by promptly sending notice through its



Nuncio to Venice that no new election of a Doge could take place



if forbidden by the Pope, and that, until the Senate had become



obedient to the papacy, no such election would be sanctioned. But



the Senate, having through its own Ambassador received a useful



hint, was quite equal to the occasion. It at once declined to



receive this or any dispatch from the Pope on the plea, made with



redundant courtesy and cordiality, that, there being no Doge,



there was no person in Venice great enough to open it. They next



as politely declined to admit the papal Nuncio on the ground that



there was nobody worthy to receive him. Then they proceeded to



elect a Doge who could receive both Nuncio and message,--a sturdy



opponent of the Vatican pretensions, Leonardo Donato.







The Senate now gave itself entirely to considering ways and means



of warding off the threatened catastrophe. Its first step was to



consult Sarpi. His answer was prompt and pithy. He advised two



things: first, to prevent, at all hazards, any publication of the



papal bulls in Venice or any obedience to them; secondly, to hold



in readiness for use at any moment an appeal to a future Council



of the Church.







Of these two methods, the first would naturally seem by far the



more difficult. So it was not in reality. In the letter which



Sarpi presented to the Doge, he devoted less than four lines to



the first and more than fourteen pages to the second. As to the



first remedy, severe as it was and bristling with difficulties,



it was, as he claimed, a simple, natural, straightforward use of



police power. As to the second, the appeal to a future Council



was to the Vatican as a red flag to a bull. The very use of it



involved excommunication. To harden and strengthen the Doge and



Senate in order that they might consider it as an ultimate



possibility, Sarpi was obliged to show from the Scriptures, the



Fathers, the Councils, the early Popes, that the appeal to a



Council was a matter of right. With wonderful breadth of



knowledge and clearness of statement he made his points and



answered objections. To this day, his letter remains a



masterpiece.[1]











[1] For Sarpi's advice to the Doge, see Bianchi Giovini, vol. i.



pp. 216, et seq. The document is given fully in the Lettere di F.



P. S., Firenze, 1863, vol. i. pp. 17, et seq.; also in Machi,



Storia del Consiglio dei Dieci, cap. xxiv., where the bull of



excommunication is also given.











The Republic utterly refused to yield, and now, in 1606, Pope



Paul launched his excommunication and interdict. In meeting them,



the Senate took the course laid down by Sarpi. The papal Nuncio



was notified that the Senate would receive no paper from the



Pope; all ecclesiasties, from the Patriarch down to the lowest



monk, were forbidden, under the penalties of high treason, to



make public or even to receive any paper whatever from the



Vatican; additional guards were placed at the city gates, with



orders to search every wandering friar or other suspicious person



who might, by any possibility, bring in a forbidden missive; a



special patrol was kept, night and day, to prevent any posting of



the forbidden notices on walls or houses; any person receiving or



finding one was to take it immediately to the authorities, under



the severest penalties, and any person found concealing such



documents was to be punished by death.







At first some of the clergy were refractory. The head of the



whole church establishment of Venice, the Patriarch himself, gave



signs of resistance; but the Senate at once silenced him. Sundry



other bishops and high ecclesiastics made a show of opposition;



and they were placed in confinement. One of them seeming



reluctant to conduct the usual church service, the Senate sent an



executioner to erect a gibbet before his door. Another, having



asked that he be allowed to await some intimation from the Holy



Spirit, received answer that the Senate had already received



directions from the Holy Spirit to hang any person resisting



their decree. The three religious orders which had showed most



opposition--Jesuits, Theatins, and Capuchins--were in a



semi-polite manner virtually expelled from the Republic.[2]











[2] For interesting details regarding the departure of the



Jesuits, see Cornet, Paolo V. e la Republica Veneta, pp. 277-279.











Not the least curious among the results of this state of things



was the war of pamphlets. From Rome, Bologna, and other centres



of thought, even from Paris and Frankfort, polemic tractates



rained upon the Republic. The vast majority of their authors were



on the side of the Vatican, and of this majority the leaders were



the two cardinals so eminent in learning and logic, Bellarmine



and Baronius; but, single-handed, Sarpi was, by general consent,



a match for the whole opposing force.[3]











[3] In the library of Cornell University are no less than nine



quartos filled with selected examples of these polemics on both



sides.











Of all the weapons then used, the most effective throughout



Europe was the solemn protest drawn by Sarpi and issued by the



Doge. It was addressed nominally to the Venetian ecclesiastics,



but really to Christendom, and both as to matter and manner it



was Father Paul at his best. It was weighty, lucid, pungent, and



deeply in earnest,--in every part asserting fidelity to the



Church and loyalty to the papacy, but setting completely at



naught the main claim of Pope Paul: the Doge solemnly declaring



himself "a prince who, in temporal matters, recognizes no



superior save the Divine Majesty."







The victory of the friar soon began to be recognized far and



near. Men called him by the name afterward so generally given



him,--the "terribile frate." The Vatican seemed paralyzed. None



of its measures availed, and it was hurt, rather than helped, by



its efforts to pester and annoy Venice at various capitals. At



Rome, it burned Father Paul's books and declared him



excommunicated; it even sought to punish his printer by putting



into the Index not only all works that he had ever printed, but



all that he might ever print. At Vienna, the papal Nuncio thought



to score a point by declaring that he would not attend a certain



religious function in case the Venetian Ambassador should appear;



whereupon the Venetian announced that he had taken physic and



regretted that he could not be present,--whereat all Europe



laughed.







Judicious friends in various European cabinets now urged both



parties to recede or to compromise. France and Spain both



proffered their good offices. The offer of France was finally



accepted, and the French Ambassador was kept running between the



Ducal Palace and the Vatican until people began laughing at him



also. The emissaries of His Holiness begged hard that, at least,



appearances might be saved; that the Republic would undo some of



its measures before the interdict was removed, or at least would



seem to do so, and especially that it would withdraw its refusals



before the Pope withdrew his penalties. All in vain. The



Venetians insisted that they had committed no crime and had



nothing to retract. The Vatican then urged that the Senate should



consent to receive absolution for its resistance to the Pope's



authority. This the Senate steadily refused; it insisted, "Let



His Holiness put things as before, and we will put things as



before; as to his absolution, we do not need it or want it; to



receive it would be to acknowledge that we have been in the



wrong." Even the last poor sop of all was refused: the Senate



would have no great "function" to celebrate the termination of



the interdict; they would not even go to the mass which Cardinal



Joyeuse celebrated on that occasion. The only appearance of



concession which the Republic made was to give up the two



ecclesiastics to the French Ambassador as a matter of courtesy to



the French king; and when this was done, the Ambassador delivered



them to the Pope; but Venice especially reserved all the rights



she had exercised. All the essential demands of the papacy were



refused, and thus was forever ended the papal power of laying an



interdict upon a city or a people. From that incubus,



Christendom, thanks to Father Paul and to Venice, was at last and



forever free.







The Vatican did, indeed, try hard to keep its old claim in being.



A few years after its defeat by Fra Paolo, it endeavored to



reassert in Spain the same authority which had been so humbly



acknowledged there a few years before. It was doubtless felt that



this most pious of all countries, which had previously been so



docile, and which had stood steadily by the Vatican against



Venice in the recent struggle, would again set an example of



submission. Never was there a greater mistake: the Vatican



received from Spanish piety a humiliating refusal.







Next it tried the old weapons against the little government at



Turin. For many generations the House of Savoy had been dutifully



submissive to religious control; nowhere out of Spain had heresy



been treated more cruelly; yet here, too, the Vatican claim was



spurned. But the final humiliation took place some years later



under Urban VIII.,--the same pontiff who wrecked papal



infallibility on Galileo's telescope. He tried to enforce his



will on the state of Lucca, which, in the days of Pope Paul, had



submitted to the Vatican decrees abjectly; but that little



republic now seized the weapons which Sarpi had devised, and



drove the papal forces out of the field: the papal



excommunication was, even by this petty government, annulled in



Venetian fashion and even less respectfully.[1]











[1] The proofs--and from Catholic sources--that it was the Pope



who condemned Galileo's doctrine of the earth's movement about



the sun, and not merely the Congregation of the Index, the



present writer has given in his History of the Warfare of Science



with Theology, vol. i. chap. iii.











Thus the world learned how weak the Vatican hold had become. Even



Pope Paul learned it, and, from being the most strenuous of



modern pontiffs, he became one of the most moderate in everything



save in the enrichment of his family. Thus ended the last serious



effort to coerce a people by an interdict, and so, one might



suppose, would end the work of Father Paul. Not so. There was to



come a second chapter in his biography, more instructive,



perhaps, than the first,--a chapter which has lasted until our



own day.                             A. D. White.











{February, 1904, number DLVI.} II.











The Venetian Republic showed itself duly grateful to Sarpi. The



Senate offered him splendid presents and entitled him "Theologian



of Venice." The presents he refused, but the title with its duty,



which was mainly to guard the Republic against the encroachments



of the Vatican, he accepted, and his life in the monastery of



Santa Fosca went on quietly, simply, laboriously, as before. The



hatred now felt for him at Rome was unbounded. It corresponded to



the gratitude at Venice. Every one saw his danger, and he well



knew it. Potentates were then wont to send assassins on long



errands, and the arm of the Vatican was especially far-reaching



and merciless. It was the period when Pius V, the Pope whom the



Church afterwards proclaimed a saint, commissioned an assassin to



murder Queen Elizabeth.[1]











[1] This statement formerly led to violent denials by



ultramontane champions; but in 1870 it was made by Lord Acton, a



Roman Catholic, one of the most learned of modern historians, and



when it was angrily denied, he quietly cited the official life of



Pope Pius in the Acta  Sanctorum, published by the highest church



authority. This was final; denial ceased, and the statement is no



longer questioned. For other proofs in the line of Lord Acton's



citation, see Bellarmine's Selbstbiographie, cited in a previous



article, pp. 306, et seq.











But there was in Father Paul a trust in Providence akin to



fatalism. Again and again he was warned, and among those who are



said to have advised him to be on his guard against papal



assassins was no less a personage than his greatest controversial



enemy,--Cardinal Bellarmine. It was believed by Sarpi's friends



that Bellarmine's Scotch ideas of duty to humanity prevailed over



his Roman ideas of fealty to the Vatican, and we may rejoice in



the hope that his nobler qualities did really assert themselves



against the casuistry of his brother prelates which sanctioned



assassination.







These warnings were soon seen to be well founded. On a pleasant



evening in October, 1607, a carefully laid trap was sprung.



Returning from his day's work at the Ducal Palace, Father Paul,



just as he had crossed the little bridge of Santa Fosca before



reaching his convent, was met by five assassins. Two of his usual



attendants had been drawn off by the outburst of a fire in the



neighborhood; the other two were old men who proved useless. The



place was well chosen. The descent from the bridge was so narrow



that all three were obliged to march in single file, and just at



this point these ruffians from Rome sprang upon him in the dusk,



separated him from his companions, and gave him, in a moment,



fifteen dagger thrusts, two in his throat and one--a fearful gash



--on the side of his head, and then, convinced that they had



killed him, escaped to their boats, only a few paces distant.







The victim lingered long in the hospital, but his sound



constitution and abstemious habits stood him in good stead. Very



important among the qualities which restored him to health were



his optimism and cheerfulness. An early manifestation of the



first of these was seen when, on regaining consciousness, he



called for the stiletto which had been drawn from the main wound



and, running his fingers along the blade, said cheerily to his



friends, "It is not filed." What this meant, any one knows who



has seen in various European collections the daggers dating from



the "ages of faith" cunningly filed or grooved to hold poison.[1]











[1] There is a remarkable example of a beautiful dagger, grooved



to contain poison, in the imperial collection of arms at Vienna.











As an example of the second of these qualities, we may take his



well-known reply when, to the surgeon dressing the wound made by



the "style" or stiletto, --who spoke of its "extravagance,"



rudeness, and yet ineffectiveness,--Fra Paolo quietly answered



that in these characteristics could be recognized the style of



the Roman Curia.







Meantime the assassins had found their way back to Rome, and were



welcomed with open arms; but it is some comfort to know that



later, when such conscience as there was throughout Italy and



Europe showed intense disgust at the proceeding, the Roman Court



treated them coldly and even severely.







The Republic continued in every way to show Sarpi its sympathy



and gratitude. It made him many splendid offer, which he refused;



but two gifts he accepted. One was full permission to explore the



Venetian archives, and the other was a little doorway, cut



through the garden wall of his monastery, enabling him to reach



his gondola without going through the narrow and tortuous path he



had formerly taken on his daily journey to the public offices.



This humble portal still remains. Beneath few triumphal arches



has there ever passed as great or as noble a conqueror.[2]











[2] The present writer has examined with care the spot where the



attack was made, and found that never was a scoundrelly plot



better conceived or more fiendishly executed. He also visited



what was remaining of the convent in April, 1902, and found the



little door as serviceable as when it was made.











Efforts were also made to cajole him,--to induce him to visit



Rome, with fine promises of recognition and honor, and with



solemn assurances that no harm should come to him; but he was too



wise to yield. Only a few years previously he had seen Giordano



Bruno lured to Rome and burned alive on the Campo dei Fiori. He



had seen his friend and correspondent, Fra Fulgentio Manfredi,



yield to similar allurements and accept a safe conduct to Rome,



which, though it solemnly guaranteed him against harm, proved as



worthless as that of John Huss at the Council of Constance; the



Inquisition torturing him to death on the spot where, six years



earlier, it had burned Bruno. He had seen his friend, the



Archdeacon Ribetti, drawn within the clutch of the Vatican, only



to die of "a most painful colic" immediately after dining with a



confidential chamberlain of the Pope, and, had he lived a few



months longer, he would have seen his friend and confidant,



Antonio de Dominis, Archbishop of Spalato, to whom he had



entrusted a copy of his most important work, enticed to Rome and



put to death by the Inquisition. Though the Vatican exercised a



strong fascination over its enemies, against Father Paul it was



powerless; he never yielded to it, but kept the even tenor of his



way.[3]











[3] A copy of Manfredi's "safe conduct" is given by Castellani,



Lettere Inedite di F. P. S., p. 12, note. Nothing could be more



explicit.











In the dispatches which now passed, comedy was mingled with



tragedy. Very unctuous was the expression by His Holiness of his



apprehensions regarding "dangers to the salvation" and of his



"fears for the souls" of the Venetian Senators, if they persisted



in asserting their own control of their own state. Hardly less



touching were the fears expressed by the good Oratorian, Cardinal



Baronius, that "a judgment might be brought upon the Republic" if



it declined to let the Vatican have its way. But these



expressions were not likely to prevail with men who had dealt



with Machiavelli.







Uncompromising as ever, Father Paul continued to write letters



and publish treatises which clenched more and more firmly into



the mind of Venice and of Europe the political doctrine of which



he was the apostle,--the doctrine that the State is rightfully



independent of the Church,--and throughout the Christian world he



was recognized as victor.







Nothing could exceed the bitterness of the attacks upon him,



though some of them, at this day, provoke a smile. While efforts



were made to discredit him among scholars by spurious writings or



by interpolations in genuine writings, efforts equally ingenious



were made to arouse popular hostility. One of these was a



painting which represented him writhing amid the flames of hell,



with a legend stating, as a reason for his punishment, that he



had opposed the Holy Father.







Now it was indeed, in the midst of ferocious attacks upon his



reputation and cunning attempts upon his life, that he entered a



new and most effective period of activity. For years, as the



adviser of Venice, he had studied, both as a historian and as a



statesman, the greatest questions which concerned his country,



and especially those which related to the persistent efforts of



the Vatican to encroach upon Venetian self-government. The



results of these studies he had embodied in reports which had



shaped the course of the Republic; and now, his learning and



powers of thought being brought to bear upon the policy of Europe



in general, as affected by similar papal encroachments, he began



publishing a series of treatises, which at once attracted general



attention.[1]











[1] For the extent to which these attacks were carried, see the



large number in the Sarpi collection at the Cornell University



Library, especially volume ix.











First of these, in 1608, came his work on the Interdict. Clearly



and concisely it revealed the nature of the recent struggle, the



baselessness of the Vatican claims, and the solidarity of



interest between Venice and all other European states regarding



the question therein settled. This work of his as a historian



clenched his work as a statesman; from that day forward no nation



has even been seriously threatened with an interdict.







Subsidiary works followed rapidly from his pen, strengthening the



civil power against the clerical; but in 1610 came a treatise,



which marked an epoch, --his History of Ecclesiastical



Benefices.[2] In this he dealt with a problem which had become



very serious, not only in Venice, but in every European state,



showed the process by which vast treasures had been taken from



the control of the civil power and heaped up for ecclesiastical



pomp and intrigue, pointed out special wrongs done by the system



to the Church as well as the State, and advocated a reform which



should restore this wealth to better uses. His arguments spread



widely and sank deep, not only in Italy, but throughout Europe,



and the nineteenth century has seen them applied effectively in



every European country within the Roman obedience.











[2] The old English translation of this book, published in 1736



at Westminster, is by no means a very rare book, and it affords



the general reader perhaps the most accessible means of



understanding Fra Paolo's simplicity, thoroughness, and vigor.











In 1611 he published his work on the Inquisition at Venice,



presenting historical arguments against the uses which



ecclesiasticism, under papal guidance, had made of that tribunal.



These arguments spread far, and developed throughout Europe those



views of the Inquisition which finally led to its destruction.



Minor treatises followed, dealing with state questions arising



between the Vatican and Venice, each treatise--thoroughly well



reasoned and convincing--having a strong effect on the discussion



of similar public questions in every other European nation.







In 1613 came two books of a high order, each marking an epoch.



The first of these was upon the Right of Sanctuary, and in it



Sarpi led the way, which all modern states have followed, out of



the old, vicious system of sanctioning crime by sheltering



criminals. The cogency of his argument and the value of its



application gained for him an especial tribute by the best



authority on such questions whom Europe had seen,--Hugo Grotius.







Closely connected with this work was that upon the Immunity of



the Clergy. Both this and the previous work were in the same



order of ideas, and the second fastened into the European mind



the reasons why no state can depend upon the Church for the



punishment of clerical criminals. His argument was a triumphant



vindication of Venice in her struggle with Paul V on this point;



but it was more than that. It became the practical guide of all



modern states. Its arguments dissipated the last efforts



throughout Europe to make a distinction, in criminal matters,



between the priestly caste and the world in general.







Among lesser treatises which followed is one which has done much



to shape modern policy regarding public instruction. This was his



book upon the Education given by the Jesuits. One idea which it



enforced sank deep into the minds of all thoughtful men,--his



statement that Jesuit maxims develop "sons disobedient to their



parents, citizens unfaithful to their country, and subjects



undutiful to their sovereign." Jesuit education has indeed been



maintained, and evidences of it may be seen in various European



countries. The traveler in Italy constantly sees in the larger



Italian towns long lines of young men and boys, sallow, thin, and



listless, walking two and two, with priests at each end of the



coffle. These are students taking their exercise, and an American



or Englishman marvels as he remembers the playing fields of his



own country. Youth are thus brought up as milksops, to be



graduated as scape-graces. The strong men who control public



affairs, who lead men and originate measures in the open, are not



bred in Jesuit forcing-houses. Even the Jesuits themselves have



acknowledged this, and perhaps the strongest of all arguments



supplementary to those given by Father Paul were uttered by Padre



Curci, eminent in his day as a Jesuit gladiator, but who realized



finally the impossibility of accomplishing great things with men



moulded by Jesuit methods.







All these works took strong hold upon European thought. Leading



men in all parts of Europe recognized Sarpi as both a great



statesman and a great historian. Among his English friends were



such men as Lord Bacon and Sir Henry Wotton; and his praises have



been sounded by Grotius, by Gibbon, by Hallam, and by Macaulay.



Strong, lucid, these works of Father Paul have always been



especially attractive to those who rejoice in the leadership of a



master mind.







But in 1619 came the most important of all,--a service to



humanity hardly less striking than that which he had rendered in



his battle against the Interdict,--his history of the Council of



Trent.







His close relations to so many of the foremost men of his day and



his long study in public archives and private libraries bore



fruit in this work, which takes rank among the few great,



enduring historical treatises of the world. Throughout, it is



vigorous and witty, but at the same time profound; everywhere it



bears evidences of truthfulness and is pervaded by sobriety of



judgment. Its pictures of the efforts or threats by



representatives of various great powers to break away from the



papacy and establish national churches; its presentation of the



arguments of anti-papal orators on one side and of Laynez and his



satellites on the other; its display of acts and revelations of



pretexts; its penetration into the whole network of intrigue, and



its thorough discussion of underlying principles,--all are



masterly.







Though the name of the author was concealed in an anagram, the



book was felt, by the Vatican party, to be a blow which only one



man could have dealt, and the worst blow which the party had



received since its author had defeated the Interdict at Venice.



Efforts were made, by outcries and calumnies, to discredit the



work, and they have been continued from that day to this, but in



vain. That there must be some gaps and many imperfections in it



is certain; but its general character is beyond the reach of



ultramontane weapons. The blow was felt to be so heavy that the



Jesuit Pallavicini was empowered to write a history of the



Council to counterbalance it, and his work was well done; but



Ranke, the most unprejudiced of judges, comparing the two,



assigns the palm to Father Paul. His book was immediately spread



throughout Europe; but of all the translations, perhaps the most



noteworthy was the English. Sarpi had entrusted a copy of the



original to his friend, Antonio de Dominis, Archbishop of



Spalato, and he, having taken refuge in England, had it



translated there, the authorship being ascribed on the title-page



to "Pietro Soave Polano." This English translation was, in vigor



and pith, worthy of the original. In it can be discerned, as



clearly as in the original, that atmosphere of intrigue and



brutal assertion of power by which the Roman Curia, after packing



the Council with petty Italian bishops, bade defiance to the



Catholic world. This translation, more than all else, has enabled



the English-speaking peoples to understand what was meant by the



Italian historian when he said that Father Paul "taught the world



how the Holy Spirit guides the Great Councils of the Church." It



remains cogent down to this day; after reading it one feels that



such guidance might equally be claimed for Tammany Hall.







Although Father Paul never acknowledged the authorship of the



history of the Council of Trent, and although his original copy,



prepared for the press, with his latest corrections, still



remains buried in the archives at Venice, the whole world knew



that he alone could have written it.







But during all these years, while elaborating opinions on the



weightiest matters of state for the Venetian Senate, and sending



out this series of books which so powerfully influenced the



attitude of his own and after generations toward the Vatican, he



was working with great effect in yet another field. With the



possible exception of Voltaire, he was the most vigorous and



influential letter-writer during the three hundred years which



separated Erasmus from Thomas Jefferson. Voltaire certainly



spread his work over a larger field, lighted it with more wit,



and gained by it more brilliant victories; but as regards



accurate historical knowledge, close acquaintance with statesmen,



familiarity with the best and worst which statesmen could do,



sober judgment and cogent argument, the great Venetian was his



superior. Curiously enough, Sarpi resembles the American



statesman more closely than either of the Europeans. Both he and



Jefferson had the intense practical interest of statesmen, not



only in the welfare of their own countries, but in all the



political and religious problems of their times. Both were keenly



alive to progress in the physical sciences, wherever made. Both



were wont to throw a light veil of humor over very serious



discussions. Both could use, with great effect, curt, caustic



description: Jefferson's letter to Governor Langdon satirizing



the crowned heads of Europe, as he had seen them, has a worthy



pendant in Fra Paolo's pictures of sundry representatives of the



Vatican. In both these writers was a deep earnestness which, at



times, showed itself in prophetic utterances. The amazing



prophecy of Jefferson against American slavery, beginning with



the words, "I tremble when I remember that God is just," which,



in the light of our civil war, seems divinely inspired, is



paralleled by some of Sarpi's utterances against the unmoral



tendencies of Jesuitism and Ultramontanism; and these too seem



divinely inspired as one reads them in the light of what has



happened since in Spain, in Sicily, in Naples, in Poland, in



Ireland, and in sundry South American republics.







The range of Sarpi's friendly relations was amazing. They



embraced statesmen, churchmen, scholars, scientific



investigators, diplomatists in every part of Europe, and among



these Galileo and Lord Bacon, Grotius and Mornay, Salmasius and



Casaubon, De Thou and Sir Henry Wotton, Bishop Bedell and



Vossius, with a great number of others of nearly equal rank.



Unfortunately the greater part of his correspondence has



perished. In the two small volumes collected by Polidori, and in



the small additional volume of letters to Simon Contarini,



Venetian Ambassador at Rome, unearthed a few years since in the



Venetian archives by Castellani, we have all that is known. It is



but a small fraction of his epistolary work, but it enables us to



form a clear opinion. The letters are well worthy of the man who



wrote the history of the Council of Trent and the protest of



Venice against the Interdict.







It is true that there has been derived from these letters, by his



open enemies on one side and his defenders of a rather sickly



conscientious sort on the other, one charge against him: this is



based on his famous declaration, "I utter falsehood never, but



the truth not to every one." ("La falsita non dico mai mai, ma la



verita non a ogniuno.")[1] Considering his vast responsibilities



as a statesman and the terrible dangers which beset him as a



theologian; that in the first of these capacities the least



misstep might wreck the great cause which he supported, and that



in the second such a misstep might easily bring him to the



torture chamber and the stake, normally healthful minds will



doubtless agree that the criticism upon these words is more



Pharisaic than wholesome.











[1] For this famous utterance, see notes of conversations given



by Christoph, Burggraf von Dohna, in July, 1608, in Briefe und



Acten zur Geschichte des Dreissigjahrigen Krieges, Munchen, 1874,



p. 79.











Sarpi was now spoken of, more than ever, both among friends and



foes, as the "terribile frate." Terrible to the main enemies of



Venice he indeed was, and the machinations of his opponents grew



more and more serious. Efforts to assassinate him, to poison him,



to discredit him, to lure him to Rome, or at least within reach



of the Inquisition, became almost frantic; but all in vain. He



still continued his quiet life at the monastery of Santa Fosca,



publishing from time to time discussions of questions important



for Venice and for Europe, working steadily in the public service



until his last hours. In spite of his excommunication and of his



friendships with many of the most earnest Protestants of Europe,



he remained a son of the church in which he was born. His life



was shaped in accordance with its general precepts, and every day



he heard mass. So his career quietly ran on until, in 1623, he



met death calmly, without fear, in full reliance upon the divine



justice and mercy. His last words were a prayer for Venice.







He had fought the good fight. He had won it for Venice and for



humanity. For all this, the Republic had, in his later years,



tried to show her gratitude, and he had quietly and firmly



refused the main gifts proposed to him. But now came a new



outburst of grateful feeling. The Republic sent notice of his



death to other powers of Europe through its Ambassadors in the



terms usual at the death of royal personages; in every way, it



showed its appreciation of his character and services, and it



crowned all by voting him a public monument.







Hardly was the decree known, when the Vatican authorities sent



notice that, should any monument be erected to Sarpi, they would



anew and publicly declare him excommunicate as a heretic. At



this, the Venetian Senate hesitated, waited, delayed. Whenever



afterwards the idea of carrying out the decree for the monument



was revived, there set in a storm of opposition from Rome. Hatred



of the terrible friar's memory seemed to grow more and more



bitter. Even rest in the grave was denied him. The church where



he was buried having been demolished, the question arose as to



the disposition of his bones. To bury them in sacred ground



outside the old convent would arouse a storm of ecclesiastical



hostility, with the certainty of their dispersion and



desecration; it seemed impossible to secure them from priestly



hatred: therefore it was that his friends took them from place to



place, sometimes concealing them in the wall of a church here,



sometimes beneath the pavement of a church there, and for a time



keeping them in a simple wooden box at the Ducal Library. The



place where his remains rested became, to most Venetians,



unknown. All that remained to remind the world of his work was



his portrait in the Ducal Library, showing the great gash made by



the Vatican assassins.







Time went on, and generations came which seemed to forget him.



Still worse, generation after generation came, carefully trained



by clerical teachers to misunderstand and hate him. But these



teachers went too far; for, in 1771, nearly one hundred and fifty



years after his death, the monk Vaerini gathered together, in a



pretended biography, all the scurrilities which could be



imagined, and endeavored to bury the memory of the great patriot



beneath them. This was too much. The old Venetian spirit, which



had so long lain dormant, now asserted itself: Vaerini was



imprisoned and his book suppressed.







A quarter of a century later the Republic fell under the rule of



Austria, and Austria's most time-honored agency in keeping down



subject populations has always been the priesthood. Again Father



Paul's memory was virtually proscribed, and in 1803 another



desperate attempt was made to cover him with infamy. In that year



appeared a book entitled The Secret History of the Life of Fra



Paolo Sarpi, and it contained not only his pretended biography,



but what claimed to be Sarpi's own letters and other documents



showing him to be an adept in scoundrelism and hypocrisy. Its



editor was the archpriest Ferrara of Mantua; but on the



title-page appeared, as the name of its author, Fontanini,



Archbishop of Ancira, a greatly respected prelate who had died



nearly seventy years before, and there was also stamped, not only



upon the preliminary, but upon the final page of the work, the



approval of the Austrian government. To this was added a pious



motto from St. Augustine, and the approval of Pius VII was



distinctly implied, since the work was never placed upon the



Index, and could not have been published at Venice, stamped as it



was and registered with the privileges of the University, without



the consent of the Vatican.







The memory of Father Paul seemed likely now to be overwhelmed.



There was no longer a Republic of Venice to guard the noble



traditions of his life and service. The book was recommended and



spread far and wide by preachers and confessors.







But at last came a day of judgment. The director of the Venetian



archives discovered and had the courage to announce that the work



was a pious fraud of the vilest type; that it was never written



by Fontanini, but that it was simply made up out of the old



scurrilous work of Vaerini, suppressed over thirty years before.



As to the correspondence served up as supplementary to the



biography, it was concocted from letters already published, with



the addition of Jesuitical interpolations and of forgeries.[1]



Now came the inevitable reaction, and with it the inevitable



increase of hatred for Austrian rule and the inevitable question,



how, if the Pope is the infallible teacher of the world in all



matters pertaining to faith and morals, could he virtually



approve this book, and why did he not, by virtue of his divine



inerrancy, detect the fraud and place its condemnation upon the



Index. The only lasting effect of the book, then, was to revive



the memory of Father Paul's great deeds and to arouse Venetian



pride in them. The fearful scar on his face in the portrait spoke



more eloquently than ever, and so it was that, early in the



nineteenth century, many men of influence joined in proposing a



suitable and final interment for the poor bones, which had seven



times been buried and reburied, and which had so long been kept



in the sordid box at the Ducal Library. The one fitting place of



burial was the cemetery of San Michele. To that beautiful island,



so near the heart of Venice, had, for many years, been borne the



remains of leading Venetians. There, too, in more recent days,



have been laid to rest many of other lands widely respected and



beloved.











[1] For a full and fair statement of the researches which exposed



this pious fraud, see Castellani, Prefect of the Library of St.



Mark, preface to his Lettere Inedite di F. P. S., p. xvii. For



methods used in interpolating or modifying passages in Sarpi's



writings, see Bianchi Giovini, Biografia di Sarpi, Zurigo, 1847,



vol. ii. pp. 135, et seq.











But the same persistent hatred which, in our own day, grudged and



delayed due honors at the tombs of Copernicus and Galileo among



Catholics, and of Humboldt among Protestants, was still bitter



against the great Venetian scholar and statesman. It could not be



forgotten that he had wrested from the Vatican the most terrible



of its weapons. But patriotic pride was strong, and finally a



compromise was made: it was arranged that Sarpi should be buried



and honored at his burial as an eminent man of science, and that



no word should be spoken of his main services to the Republic and



to the world. On this condition he was buried with simple honors.







Soon, however, began another chapter of hatred. There came a pope



who added personal to official hostility. Gregory XVI, who in his



earlier days had been abbot of the monastery of San Michele, was



indignant that the friar who had thwarted the papacy should lie



buried in the convent which he himself had formerly ruled, and



this feeling took shape, first, in violent speeches at Rome, and



next, in brutal acts at Venice. The monks broke and removed the



simple stone placed over the remains of Father Paul, and when it



was replaced, they persisted in defacing and breaking it, and



were only prevented from dragging out his bones, dishonoring them



and casting them into the lagoon, by the weight of the massive,



strong, well-anchored sarcophagus, which the wise foresight of



his admirers had provided for them. At three different visits to



Venice, the present writer sought the spot where they were laid,



and in vain. At the second of these visits, he found the



Patriarch of Venice, under whose rule various outrages upon



Sarpi's memory had been perpetrated, pontificating gorgeously



about the Grand Piazza; but at his next visit there had come a



change. The monks had disappeared. Their insults to the



illustrious dead had been stopped by laws which expelled them



from their convent, and there, little removed from each other in



the vestibule and aisle of the great church, were the tombs of



Father Paul and of the late Patriarch side by side; the great



patriot's simple gravestone was now allowed to rest unbroken.







Better even than this was the reaction provoked by these



outbursts of ecclesiastical hatred. It was felt, in Venice,



throughout Italy, and indeed throughout the world, that the old



decree for a monument should now be made good. The first steps



were hesitating. First, a bust of Father Paul was placed among



those of great Venetians in the court of the Ducal Palace; but



the inscription upon it was timid and double-tongued. Another



bust was placed on the Pincian Hill at Rome, among those of the



most renowned sons of Italy. This was not enough: a suitable



monument must be erected. Yet it was delayed, timid men



deprecating the hostility of the Roman Court. At last, under the



new Italian monarchy, the patriotic movement became irresistible,



and the same impulse which erected the splendid statue to



Giordano Bruno on the Piazza dei Fiori at Rome,--on the very spot



where he was burned,--and which adorned it with the medallions of



eight other martyrs to ecclesiastical hatred, erected in 1892,



two hundred and seventy years after it had been decreed, a



statue, hardly less imposing, to Paolo Sarpi, on the Piazza Santa



Fosca at Venice, where he had been left for dead by the Vatican



assassins. There it stands, noble and serene,--a monument of



patriotism and right reason, a worthy tribute to one who, among



intellectual prostitutes and solemnly constituted impostors,



stood forth as a true man, the greatest of his time,--one of the



greatest of all times,--an honor to Venice, to Italy, and to



humanity.                                  Andrew D. White.







*************************************************************







Then came the death of the Empress Frederick. Even during her



tragic struggle with Bismarck, and the unpopularity which beset



her during my former official term at Berlin, she had been kind



to me and mine. At my presentation to her in those days, at



Potsdam, when she stood by the side of her husband, afterward the



most beloved of emperors since Marcus Aurelius, she evidently



exerted herself to make the interview pleasant to me. She talked



of American art and the Colorado pictures of Moran, which she had



seen and admired; of German art and the Madonna painted by Knaus



for the Russian Empress, which Miss Wolfe had given the



Metropolitan Museum at New York; and in reply to my



congratulations upon a recent successful public speech of her



eldest son, a student at Bonn, she had dwelt, in a motherly way,



upon the difficulties which environ a future sovereign at a great



university. In more recent days, and especially during the years



before her death, she had been, at her table in Berlin and at her



castle of Kronberg, especially courteous. There comes back to me



pleasantly a kindly retort of hers. I had spoken to her of a



portrait of George III which had interested me at the old castle



of Homburg nearly forty years before. It had been sent to his



daughter, the Landgravine of Hesse-Homburg, who had evidently



wished to see her father's face as it had really become; for it



represented the King, not in the gold-laced uniform, not in the



trim wig not in the jauntily tied queue of his official portraits



and statues, but as he was: in confinement, wretched and



demented; in a slouching gown, with a face sad beyond expression;



his long, white hair falling about it and over it; of all



portraits in the world, save that, at Florence, of Charles V in



his old age, the saddest. So, the conversation drifting upon



George III and upon the old feeling between the United States and



Great Britain, now so happily changed, I happened to say, "It is



a remembrance of mine, now hard to realize, that I was brought up



to ABHOR the memory of George III." At this she smiled and



answered, "That was very unjust; for I was brought up to ADORE



the memory of Washington." Then she spoke at length regarding the



feeling of her father and mother toward the United States during



our Civil War, saying that again and again she had heard her



father argue to her mother, Queen Victoria, for the Union and



against slavery. She discussed current matters of world politics



with the strength of a statesman; yet nothing could be more



womanly in the highest sense. On my saying that I hoped to see



the day when Germany, Great Britain, and the United States would



stand together in guarding the peace of the world, she threw up



her hands and replied, "Heaven grant it; but you forget Japan."



The funeral at Potsdam dwells in my mind as worthy of her. There



were, indeed, pomp and splendor, but subdued, as was befitting;



and while the foreign representatives stood beside her coffin,



the Emperor spoke to me, very simply and kindly, of his sorrow



and of mine. Then, to the sound of funeral music and muffled



church bells, he, with the King of Great Britain and members of



their immediate family just behind the funeral car, the



ambassadors accompanying them, and a long procession following,



walked slowly along the broad avenue through that beautiful



forest, until, in the Church of Peace, she was laid by the side



of her husband, Emperor Frederick the Noble.















CHAPTER XLIII







BERLIN, YALE, OXFORD, AND ST. ANDREWS--1901-1903







Darkest of all hours during my embassy was that which brought



news of the assassination of President McKinley. It was on the



very day after his great speech at Buffalo had gained for him the



admiration and good will of the world. Then came a week of



anxiety--of hope alternating with fear; I not hopeful: for there



came back to me memories of President Garfield's assassination



during my former official stay in Berlin, and of our hope against



hope during his struggle for life: all brought to naught. Late in



the evening of September 14 came news of the President's



death--opening a new depth of sadness; for I had come not merely



to revere him as a patriot and admire him as a statesman, but to



love him as a man. Few days have seemed more overcast than that



Sunday when, at the little American chapel in Berlin, our colony



held a simple service of mourning, the imperial minister of



foreign affairs and other representatives of the government



having quietly come to us. The feeling of the German people--awe,



sadness, and even sympathy--was real. Formerly they had disliked



and distrusted the President as the author of the protective



policy which had cost their industries so dear; but now, after



his declaration favoring reciprocity,--with his full recognition



of the brotherhood of nations,--and in view of this calamity, so



sudden, so distressing, there had come a revulsion of feeling.







To see one whom I so honored, and who had formerly been so



greatly misrepresented, at last recognized as a great and true



man was, at least, a solace.







At this period came the culmination of a curious episode in my



official career. During the war in China the Chinese minister at



Berlin, Lu-Hai-Houan, feeling himself cut off from relations with



the government to which he was accredited, and, indeed, with all



the other powers of Europe, had come at various times to me, and



with him, fortunately, came his embassy counselor, Dr. Kreyer,



whom I had previously known at Berlin and St. Petersburg as a



thoughtful man, deeply anxious for the welfare of China, and



appreciative of the United States, where he had received his



education. The minister was a kindly old mandarin of high rank,



genial, gentle, evidently struggling hard against the depression



caused by the misfortunes of his country, and seeking some little



light, if, perchance, any was to be obtained. In his visits to



me, and at my return visits to him, the whole condition of things



in China was freely and fully discussed, and never have I exerted



myself more to give useful advice. First, I insisted upon the



necessity of amends for the fearful wrong done by China to other



nations, and then presented my view of the best way of developing



in his country a civilization strong enough to resist hostile



forces, exterior and interior. As to dealings with the Christian



missionaries, against whom he showed no fanatical spirit, but



who, as he thought, had misunderstood China and done much harm, I



sought to show him that the presumption was in their favor, but



that if the Chinese Government ultimately came to the decision



that their stay in China was incompatible with the safety of the



nation, its course was simple: that on no account was it to kill



or injure any of them or of their converts; that while, in my



view, it would be wise to arrange for their continuance in China



under proper regulation, still, that if they must be expelled, it



should be done in the most kindly and considerate way, and with



due indemnity for any losses to which they might be subjected. Of



course, there was no denying that, under the simplest principles



of international law, China has the right at any moment to shut



its doors against, or to expel, any people whatever whom it may



consider dangerous or injurious--this power being constantly



exercised by all the other nations of the earth, and by none more



than by the American Government, as so many Chinese seeking



entrance to our ports have discovered; but again and again I



warned him that this, if it were ever done at all, must be done



without harshness and with proper indemnities, and that any



return to the cruelties of the past would probably end in the



dividing up of maritime China among the great powers of the



world. As to the building up of the nation, I laid stress on the



establishment of institutions for technical instruction; and took



pains to call his attention to what had been done in the United



States and by various European governments in this respect. He



seemed favorably impressed by this, but dwelt on what he



considered the fanaticism of sundry Chinese supporters of



technical education against the old Chinese classical



instruction. Here I suggested to him a system which might save



what was good in the old mode of instruction: namely, the



continuance of the best of the old classical training, but giving



also high rank to modern studies.







We also talked over the beginning of a better development of the



Chinese army and navy, of better systems of taxation, and of the



nations from which good examples and competent instruction might



be drawn in these various fields. Curious was his suggestion of a



possible amalgamation of Chinese moral views with the religious



creeds of the western world. He observed that Christianity seemed



to be weak, mainly, on the moral side, and he suggested, at some



length, a combination of the Christian religion with the



Confucian morality. Interesting was it to hear him, as a



Confucian, dwell on the services which might thus be rendered to



civilization. There was a simple, kindly shrewdness in the man,



and a personal dignity which was proof against the terrible



misfortunes which had beset his country. Again and again he



visited me, always wishing to discuss some new phase of the



questions at issue. I could only hope that, as he was about to



return to China, some of the ideas brought out in our



conversations might prove fruitful. One result of the relation



thus formed was that when Prince Chun, the brother of the Emperor



of China, came to make apology before the throne of the Emperor



William, he called upon me. Unfortunately I was out, but,



returning his visit, I met him, and, what was more to the



purpose, the dignitaries of his suite, some of whom interested me



much; and I was glad of a chance, through them, to impress some



of the ideas brought out in my previous conversations with the



minister. I cannot say that I indulged in any strong hopes as



regards the prince himself; but, noting the counselors who



surrounded him, and their handling of the questions at issue, I



formed more hope for the conservation of China as a great and



beneficent power than I had ever had before.







To this succeeded an episode of a very different sort. For some



time Mr. Andrew Carnegie had done me the honor to listen to



advice of mine regarding some of his intended benefactions in



Scotland, the United States, and elsewhere. I saw and felt the



great possibilities for good involved when so noble a heart, so



shrewd a head, so generous a hand had command of one of the most



colossal fortunes ever at the disposal of a human being; and the



bright purposes and plans revealed in his letters shone through



the clouds of that mournful summer. So it was that, on my journey



to America, made necessary by the sudden death of my son, I



accepted Mr. Carnegie's invitation to visit him at his castle of



Skibo in the extreme north of Scotland. Very striking, during the



two days' journey from London to Edinburgh, and from Edinburgh to



Bonar, were the evidences of mourning for President McKinley in



every city, village, and hamlet. It seemed natural that, in the



large towns and on great public buildings, flags at half-mast and



in mourning should show a sense of the calamity which had



befallen a sister nation; but what appealed to me most were the



draped and half-masted flags on the towers of the little country



churches and cottages. Never before in the history of any two



countries had such evidences of brotherly feeling been shown.



Thank God! brotherly feeling had conquered demagogism.







The visit to Mr. Carnegie helped to give a new current to my



thoughts. The attractions of his wonderful domain forty thousand



acres, with every variety of scenery,--ocean, forest, moor, and



mountain,--the household with its quaint Scotch usages--the piper



in full tartan solemnly going his rounds at dawn, and the music



of the organ swelling, morning and evening, through the castle



from the great hall--all helped to give me new strength. There



was also good company: Frederic Harrison, thoughtful and



brilliant, whom I had before known only by his books and a brief



correspondence; Archdeacon Sinclair of London, worthy, by his



scholarly accomplishments, of his descent from the friend of



Washington; and others who did much to aid our hosts in making



life at the castle beautiful. Going thence to America, I found



time to cooperate with my old friend, President Gilman, in



securing data for Mr. Carnegie, especially at Washington, in view



of his plan of a national institution for the higher scientific



research.







It was a sad home-coming; but these occupations and especially a



visit to New Haven at the bicentennial celebration of Yale aided



to cheer me. This last was indeed a noteworthy commemoration.



There had come to me, in connection with it, perhaps the greatest



honor of my life: an invitation to deliver one of the main



addresses; but it had been received at the time of my deepest



depression, and I had declined it, but with no less gratitude



that the authorities of my Alma Mater had thought me worthy of



that service. In so doing, I sacrificed much; for there was one



subject which, under other circumstances, I would gladly have



developed at such a time and before such an audience. But as I



listened to the admirable address given by my old college mate,



Mr. Justice Brewer, when the honors of the university were



conferred upon the President, the Secretary of State, and so many



distinguished representatives from all parts of the world, it was



a satisfaction to me, after all, that I could enjoy it quietly,



with no sense of responsibility, and could, indeed, rest and be



thankful.







As to my own personal history, there came at this time an event



which could not but please me: the Royal Academy of Sciences at



Berlin chose me as one of its foreign honorary members. It was a



tribute of the sort for which I cared most, especially because it



brought me into closer relations with leaders in science and



literature whom I had so long admired.







To finish the chronicle of that period, I may add that, on my



return from America, being invited to Potsdam for the purpose, I



gave the Emperor the very hearty message which the President had



sent him, and that, during this interview and the family dinner



which followed it, he spoke most appreciatively and intelligently



of the President, of the recent victory for good government in



the city of New York, of the skill shown by Americans in great



works of public utility, and especially of the remarkable



advances in the development of our navy.







One part of this conversation had a lighter cast. At the close of



that portion of the communication from the President which



referred to various public affairs came a characteristic touch in



the shape of an invitation to hunt in the Rocky Mountain regions:



it was the simple message of one healthy, hearty, vigorous hunter



to another, and was to the effect that the President especially



envied the Emperor for having shot a whale, but that if his



Majesty would come to America he should have the best possible



opportunity to add to his trophies a Rocky Mountain lion, and



that he would thus be the first monarch to kill a lion since



Tiglath-Pileser, whose exploit is shown on the old monuments of



Assyria. The hearty way in which the message was received showed



that it would have been gladly accepted had that been possible.







On New Year's day of 1902 began the sixth year of my official



stay at Berlin. At his reception of the ambassadors the Emperor



was very cordial, spoke most heartily regarding President



Roosevelt, and asked me to forward his request that the



President's daughter might be allowed to christen the imperial



yacht then building in America. In due time this request was



granted, and as the special representative of the sovereign at



its launching he named his brother--Prince Henry. No man in the



empire could have been more fitly chosen. His career as chief



admiral of the German navy had prepared him to profit by such a



journey, and his winning manners assured him a hearty welcome.







My more serious duties were now relieved by sundry festivities,



and of these was a dinner on the night of the prince's departure



from Berlin, given to the American Embassy by the Emperor, who



justly hoped and believed that the proposed expedition would



strengthen good feeling between the two countries. After dinner



we all sat in the smoking-room of the old Schloss until midnight,



and various pleasant features of the conversation dwell in my



memory--particularly the Emperor's discussions of Mark Twain and



other American humorists; but perhaps the most curious was his



amusement over a cutting from an American newspaper--a printed



recipe for an American concoction known as "Hohenzollern punch,"



said to be in readiness for the prince on his arrival. The number



of intoxicants, and the ingenuity of their combination, as his



Majesty read the list aloud, were amazing; it was a terrific



brew, which only a very tough seaman could expect to survive.







But as we all took leave of the prince at the station afterward,



there were in my heart and mind serious misgivings. I knew well



that, though the great mass of the American people were sure to



give him a hearty welcome, there were scattered along his route



many fanatics, and, most virulent of all, those who had just then



been angered by the doings of sundry Prussian underlings in



Poland. I must confess to uneasiness during his whole stay in



America, and among the bright days of my life was that on which



the news came that he was on board a German liner and on his



return.







One feature of that evening is perhaps more worthy of record.



After the departure of the prince, the Emperor's conversation



took a more serious turn, and as we walked toward his carriage he



said, "My brother's mission has no political character whatever,



save in one contingency: If the efforts made in certain parts of



Europe to show that the German Government sought to bring about a



European combination against the United States during your



Spanish war are persisted in, I have authorized him to lay before



the President certain papers which will put that slander at rest



forever." As it turned out, there was little need of this, since



the course both of the Emperor and his government was otherwise



amply vindicated.







The main matter of public business during the first months of the



year was the Russian occupation of Manchuria, regarding which our



government took a very earnest part, instructing me to press the



matter upon the attention of the German Government, and to follow



it up with especial care. Besides this, it was my duty to urge a



fitting representation of Germany at the approaching St. Louis



Exposition. Regarding this there were difficulties. The Germans



very generally avowed themselves exposition-weary



(Ausstellungsmude); and no wonder, for exposition had succeeded



exposition, now in this country, now in that, and then in various



American cities, each anxious to outdo the other, until all



foreign governments were well-nigh tired out. But the St. Louis



Exposition encountered an adverse feeling much more serious than



any caused by fatigue,--the American system of high protection



having led the Germans to distrust all our expositions, whether



at New Orleans, Chicago, Buffalo, or St. Louis, and to feel that



there was really nothing in these for Germany; that, in fact,



German manufacturing interests would be better served by avoiding



them than by taking part in them. Still, by earnest presentation



of the matter at the Foreign Office and to the Emperor, I was



able to secure a promise that German art should be well



represented.







In March, a lull having come in public business as well as in



social duty, I started on my usual excursion to Italy, its most



interesting feature being my sixth stay in Venice. Ten days in



that fascinating city were almost entirely devoted to increasing



my knowledge of Fra Paolo Sarpi. Various previous visits had



familiarized me with the main events in his wonderful career; but



I now met with two pieces of especially good fortune. First, I



made the acquaintance of the Rev. Dr. Alexander Robertson, an



ardent admirer of Father Paul, and author of an excellent



biography of him; and, next, I was able to add to my own material



a mass of rare books and manuscripts relating to the great



Venetian. Most interesting was my visit, in company with Dr.



Robertson, to the remains of Father Paul's old monastery, where



we found what no one, up to our time, seems to have



discovered--the little door which the Venetian Senate caused to



be made in the walls of the monastery garden, at Father Paul's



request, in order that he might reach his gondola at once, and



not be again exposed to assassins like those sent by Pope Paul V,



who had attacked him and left him, to all appearances dead, in



the little street near the monastery.







Returning to Berlin, the usual round of duty was resumed; but



there seems nothing worthy to be chronicled, save possibly the



visit of the Shah of Persia and the Crown Prince of Siam. Both



were seen in all their glory at the gala opera given in their



honor; but the Persian ruler appeared to little advantage, for he



was obliged to retire before the close of the representation. He



was evidently prematurely old and worn out. The feature of this



social function which especially dwells in my memory was a very



interesting talk with the Emperor regarding the kindness shown



his brother by the American people, at the close of which he



presented me to his guest, the Crown Princess of Saxony. She was



especially kindly and pleasing, discussing various topics with



heartiness and simplicity; and it was a vast surprise to me when,



a few months later, she became the heroine of perhaps the most



astonishing escapade in the modern history of royalty.







As to matters of business, there came one which especially



rejoiced me. Mr. Carnegie having established the institution for



research which bears his name at Washington, with an endowment of



ten million dollars, and named me among the trustees, my old



friend Dr. Gilman had later been chosen President of the new



institution, and now arrived in Berlin to study the best that



Germans were doing as regards research in science. Our excursions



to various institutions interested me greatly; both the men we



met and things we saw were full of instruction to us, and of all



public duties I have had to discharge, I recall none with more



profit and pleasure. One thing in this matter struck me as never



before--the quiet wisdom and foresight with which the various



German governments prepare to profit by the best which science



can be made to yield them in every field.







Upon these duties followed others of a very different sort. On



the 19th of June died King Albert of Saxony, and in view of his



high character and of the many kindnesses he had shown to



Americans, I was instructed to attend his funeral at Dresden as a



special representative of the President. The whole ceremonial was



interesting; there being in it not only a survival of various



mediaeval procedures, but many elements of solemnity and beauty;



and the funeral, which took place at the court church in the



evening, was especially impressive. Before the high altar stood



the catafalque; in front of it, the crown, scepter, orb, and



other emblems of royalty; and at its summit, the coffin



containing the body of the King. Around this structure were



ranged lines of soldiers and pages in picturesque uniforms and



bearing torches. Facing these were the seats for the majesties,



including the new King, who had at his right the Emperor of



Austria, and at his left the German Emperor, while next these



were the seats of foreign ambassadors and other representatives.



Of all present, the one who seemed least in accord with his



surroundings was the nephew of the old and the son of the new



King, Prince Max, who was dressed simply as a priest, his plain



black gown in striking contrast with the gorgeous uniforms of the



other princes immediately about him. The only disconcerting



feature was the sermon. It was given by one of the priests



attached to the court church, and he evidently considered this an



occasion to be made much of; for instead of fifteen minutes, as



had been expected, his sermon lasted an hour and twenty minutes,



much to the discomfort of the crowd of officials, who were



obliged to remain standing from beginning to end, and especially



to the chagrin of the two Emperors, whose special trains and



time-tables, as well as the railway arrangements for the general



public, were thereby seriously deranged.







But all fatigues were compensated by the music. The court choir



of Dresden is famous, and for this occasion splendid additions



had been made both to it and to the orchestra; nothing in its way



could be more impressive, and as a climax came the last honors to



the departed King, when, amid the music of an especially



beautiful chorus, the booming of artillery in the neighboring



square, and the tolling of the bells of the city on all sides,



the royal coffin slowly sank into the vaults below.







On the following morning I was received by the new King. He



seemed a man of sound sense, and likely to make a good



constitutional sovereign. Our talk was simply upon the relations



of the two countries, during which I took pains to bespeak for my



countrymen sojourning at Dresden the same kindnesses which the



deceased King had shown them.







During the summer a study of some of the most important



industries at the Dusseldorf Exposition proved useful; but



somewhat later other excursions had a more direct personal



interest; for within a few hours of each other came two



unexpected communications: one from the president of Yale



University, commissioning me to represent my Alma Mater at the



tercentenary of the Bodleian at Oxford; the other from the



University of St. Andrews, inviting me to the installation of Mr.



Andrew Carnegie as lord rector of that institution; and both



these I accepted.







The celebration at Oxford was in every way interesting to me; but



I may say frankly that of all things which gave me pleasure, the



foremost was the speech of presentation, in the Sheldonian



Theatre, when the doctorate of civil law was conferred upon me.



The first feature in this speech, assigning the reasons for



conferring the degree, was a most kindly reference to my part in



establishing the Arbitration Tribunal at the International



Conference of The Hague; and this, of course, was gratifying. But



the second half of the speech touched me more nearly; for it was



a friendly appreciation of my book regarding the historical



relations between science and theology in Christendom. This was a



surprise indeed! Years before, when writing this book, I had said



to myself, "This ends all prospect of friendly recognition of any



work I may ever do, so far as the universities and academies of



the world are concerned. But so be it; what I believe I will



say." And now, suddenly, unexpectedly, came recognition and



commendation in that great and ancient center of religious



thought and sentiment, once so reactionary, where, within my



memory, even a man like Edward Everett was harshly treated for



his inability to accept the shibboleths of orthodoxy.







This reviving of old and beginning of new friendships, with the



hearty hospitality lavished upon us from all sides, left



delightful remembrances. Several times, during the previous fifty



years, I had visited Oxford and been cordially welcomed; but this



greeting surpassed all others.







There was, indeed, one slight mishap. Being called upon to speak



in behalf of the guests at the great dinner in Christ Church



Hall, I endeavored to make a point which I thought new and



perhaps usefully suggestive. Having referred to the increasing



number of international congresses, expositions, conferences,



academic commemorations, anniversaries, and the like, I dwelt



briefly on their agency in generating friendships between men of



influence in different countries, and therefore in maintaining



international good will; and then especially urged, as the pith



and point of my speech, that such agencies had recently been made



potent for peace as never before. In support of this view, I



called attention to the fact that the Peace Conference at The



Hague had not only established an arbitration tribunal for



PREVENTING war, but had gained the adhesion of all nations



concerned to a number of arrangements, such as international



"Commissions of Inquiry," the system of "Seconding Powers," and



the like, for DELAYING war, thus securing time during which



better international feelings could assert themselves, and



reasonable men on either side could work together to bring in the



sober second thought; that thereby the friendships promoted by



these international festivities had been given, as never before,



time to assert themselves as an effective force for peace against



jingo orators, yellow presses, and hot-heads generally; and



finally, in view of this increased efficiency of such gatherings



in promoting peace, I urged that they might well be multiplied on



both sides of the Atlantic, and that as many delegates as



possible should be sent to them.







"A poor thing, but mine own." Alas! next day, in the press, I was



reported as simply uttering the truism that such gatherings



increase the peaceful feeling of nations; and so the main point



of my little speech was lost. But it was a slight matter, and of



all my visits to Oxford, this will remain in my memory as the



most delightful.[7]











[7] The full speech has since been published in the "Yale Alumni



Weekly."











The visit to St. Andrews was also happy. After the principal of



the university had conferred the doctorate of laws upon several



of the guests, including Mr. Choate, the American ambassador at



London, and myself, Mr. Carnegie gave his rectorial address. It



was decidedly original, its main feature being an argument in



behalf of a friendly union of the United States and Great Britain



in their political and commercial policy, and for a similar union



between the Continental European nations for the protection of



their industries and for the promotion of universal peace, with a



summons to the German Emperor to put himself at the head of the



latter. It was prepared with skill and delivered with force. Very



amusing were the attempts of the great body of students to throw



the speaker off his guard by comments, questions, and chaff. I



learned later that, more than once, orators has thus been



entrapped or entangled, and that on one occasion an address had



been completely wrecked by such interruptions; but Mr. Carnegie's



Scotch-Yankee wit carried him through triumphantly: he met all



these efforts with equanimity and good humor, and soon had the



audience completely on his side.







Returning to Berlin, there came preparations for closing my



connection with the embassy. I had long before decided that on my



seventieth birthday I would cease to hold any official position



whatever. Pursuant to that resolution, my resignation had been



sent to the President, with the statement that it must be



considered final. In return came the kindest possible letters



from him and from the Secretary of State; both of them



attributing a value to my services much beyond anything I would



dare claim.







On my birthday came a new outburst of kindness. From all parts of



Europe and America arrived letters and telegrams, while from the



Americans in various parts of Germany--especially from the Berlin



colony--came a superbly engrossed address, and with it a



succession of kindly visitors representing all ranks in Berlin



society. One or two of these testimonials I may be pardoned for



especially mentioning. Some time after the letter from President



Roosevelt above mentioned, there had come from him a second



epistle, containing a sealed envelop on which were inscribed the



words: "To be opened on your seventieth birthday." Being duly



opened on the morning of that day, it was found to be even more



heartily appreciative than his former letter, and the same was



found to be true of a second letter by the Secretary of State,



Mr. Hay; so that I add these to the treasures to be handed down



to my grandchildren.







Shortly afterward came a letter from the chancellor of the



empire, most kindly appreciative. It will be placed, with those



above referred to, at the close of this chapter.







Especially noteworthy also was the farewell dinner given me at



the Kaiserhof by the German-American Association. Never had I



seen so many Germans eminent in politics, diplomacy, literature,



science, art, education, and commerce assembled on any single



occasion. Hearty speeches were made by the minister of the



interior, Count Posadowsky, who presided, and by Professor



Harnack of the university, who had been selected to present the



congratulations of my entertainers. I replied at length, and as



in previous speeches during my career, both as minister and



ambassador, I had endeavored to present to my countrymen at home



and abroad the claims of Germany upon American good will, I now



endeavored to reveal to the great body of thinking Germans some



of the deeper characteristics and qualities of the American



people; my purpose being in this, as in previous speeches, to



bring about a better understanding between the two nations.







The Emperor being absent in England, my departure from Berlin was



delayed somewhat beyond the time I had fixed; but on the 27th of



November came my final day in office. In the morning my wife and



myself were received in special audience by both the sovereigns,



who afterward welcomed us at their table. Both showed unaffected



cordiality. The Emperor discussed with me various interesting



questions in a most friendly spirit, and, on my taking leave,



placed in my hands what is known as the "Great Gold Medal for Art



and Science," saying that he did this at the request of his



advisers in those fields, and adding assurances of his own which



greatly increased the value of the gift. Later in the day came a



superb vase from the royal manufactory of porcelain, bearing his



portrait and cipher, as a token of personal good will.







On the same evening was the American Thanksgiving dinner, with



farewells to and from the American colony, and during the



following days farewell gatherings at the houses of the dean of



the ambassadors, the secretary of state for foreign affairs, and



the chancellor of the empire; finally, on the evening of December



5, with hearty good-byes at the station from a great concourse of



my diplomatic colleagues and other old friends, we left Berlin.







Our first settlement was at a pretty villa at Alassio, on the



Italian Riviera; and here, in March, 1903, looking over my



garden, a mass of bloom, shaded by palms and orange-trees in full



bearing, and upon the Mediterranean beyond, I settled down to



record these recollections of my life--making excursions now and



then into interesting parts of Italy.







As to these later journeys, one, being out of the beaten track,



may be worth mentioning. It was an excursion in the islands of



Elba and Corsica. Though anything but a devotee of Napoleon, I



could not but be interested in that little empire of his on the



Italian coast, and especially in the town house, country-seat,



and garden where he planned the return to Europe which led to the



final catastrophe.







More interesting still was the visit to Corsica and, especially,



to Ajaccio. There the traveler stands before the altar where



Napoleon's father and mother were married, at the font where he



was baptized, in the rooms where he was born, played with his



brothers during his boyhood, and developed various scoundrelisms



during his young manhood: the furniture and surroundings being as



they were when he knew them.







Just around the corner from the house in which the Bonapartes



lived was the more stately residence of the more aristocratic



family of Pozzo di Borgo. It interested me as the nest in which



was reared that early playmate and rival of Napoleon, who



afterward became his most virulent, persistent, and successful



enemy, who pursued him through his whole career as a hound



pursues a wolf, and who at last aided most effectively in



bringing him down.







After exhausting the attractions of Ajaccio, we drove up a broad,



well-paved avenue, gradually rising and curving until, at a



distance of six or seven miles, it ended at the country-seat of



this same family of Pozzo di Borgo, far up among the mountains.



There, on a plateau commanding an amazing view, and in the midst



of a superb park, we found the rural retreat of the family; but,



to our surprise, not a castle, not a villa, not like any other



building for a similar purpose in Italy or anywhere else in the



world, but a Parisian town house, recently erected in the style



of the Valois period, with Mansard roof. As we approached it, I



was struck by architectural details even more at variance with



the surroundings than was the general style of the building: all



its exterior decoration presenting the features of a pavilion



from the old Tuileries at Paris; and in the garden hard by we



found battered and blackened fragments of pilasters, shown by the



emblems and ciphers upon them to have come from that part of the



Tuileries once inhabited by Napoleon. The family being absent, we



were allowed to roam through the house, and there found the



statues, paintings, tapestries, books, and papers of Napoleon's



arch-enemy, the great Pozzo di Borgo himself, all of them more or



less connected with the great struggle. There, too, in the



library were collected the decorations bestowed upon him by all



the sovereigns of Europe for his successful zeal in hunting down



the common enemy--"the Corsican Ogre." The palace, inside and



out, is a monument to the most famous of Corsican vendettas.







My two winters at Alassio after leaving Berlin, though filled



with deferred work, were restful. During a visit to America in



1903, I joined my class at Yale in celebrating its fiftieth



anniversary, giving there a public address entitled "A Patriotic



Investment." The main purpose of this address was to promote the



establishment of Professorships of Comparative Legislation in our



leading universities. I could not think then, and cannot think



now, of any endowment likely to be more speedily and happily



fruitful in good to the whole country. In the spring of 1904 I



returned to my old house on the grounds of Cornell University,



and there, with my family, old associates, and new friends about



me, have devoted myself to various matters long delayed, and



especially to writing sundry articles in the "Atlantic Monthly,"



the "Century Magazine," and various other periodicals, and to the



discharge of my duties as a Trustee of Cornell and as a Regent of



the Smithsonian Institution and a Trustee of the Carnegie



Institution at Washington. It is, of course, the last of my life,



but I count myself happy in living to see so much of good



accomplished and so much promise of good in every worthy field of



human effort throughout our country and indeed throughout the



world.







Following are the letters referred to in this chapter.







FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.



WHITE HOUSE,



WASHINGTON.                                    







OYSTER BAY, NEW YORK,



                                    August 5, 1902. 



MY DEAR AMBASSADOR WHITE:







It is with real regret that I accept your resignation, for I



speak what is merely a self-evident truth when I say that we



shall have to look with some apprehension to what your successor



does, whoever that successor may be, lest he fall short of the



standard you have set.







It is a very great thing for a man to be able to feel, as you



will feel when on your seventieth birthday you prepare to leave



the Embassy, that you have been able to serve your country as it



has been served by but a very limited number of people in your



generation. You have done much for it in word and in deed. You



have adhered to a lofty ideal and yet have been absolutely



practical and, therefore, efficient, so that you are a perpetual



example to young men how to avoid alike the Scylla of



indifference and the Charybdis of efficiency for the wrong....







With regards and warm respect and admiration,                     



         Faithfully yours,



                     (Signed) THEODORE ROOSEVELT.

MY DEAR MR. AMBASSADOR:







Will you read the inclosed on your seventieth birthday? I have



sealed it so you can break the seal then.                         



Faithfully yours,

September 15, 1902.







MY DEAR MR. AMBASSADOR:







On the day you open this you will be seventy years old. I cannot



forbear writing you a line to express the obligation which all



the American people are under to you. As a diplomat you have come



in that class whose foremost exponents are Benjamin Franklin and



Charles Francis Adams, and which numbers also in its ranks men



like Morris, Livingston, and Pinckney. As a politician, as a



publicist, and as a college president you have served your



country as only a limited number of men are able to serve it. You



have taught by precept, and you have taught by practice. We are



all of us better because you have lived and worked, and I send



you now not merely my warmest well-wishes and congratulations,



but thanks from all our people for all that you have done for us



in the past.                     Faithfully yours,                



         (Signed) THEODORE ROOSEVELT.

NEWBURY, N. H.,                                         







August 3, 1902.







DEAR MR. WHITE:







I have received your very kind letter of the 21st July, which is



the first intimation I have had of your intention to resign your



post of ambassador to Germany. I am sorry to hear the country is



to lose your services in the place you have filled with such



distinguished ability and dignity. It is a great thing to say--as



it is simple truth to say it--that you have, during your



residence in Berlin, increased the respect felt for America not



only in Germany but in all Europe. You have thus rendered a great



public service,--independent of all the details of your valuable



work. The man is indeed fortunate who can go through a long



career without blame, and how much more fortunate if he adds



great achievement to blamelessness. You have the singular



felicity of having been always a fighting man, and having gone



through life without a wound.







I congratulate you most on your physical and mental ability to



enjoy the rest you have chosen and earned....







My wife joins me in cordial regards to Mrs. White, and I am



always,      



            



Faithfully yours,                               



(Signed) JOHN HAY.











DEPARTMENT OF STATE,



WASHINGTON,







November 7, 1902.







DEAR MR. WHITE:







I cannot let the day pass without sending you a word of cordial



congratulation on the beginning of what I hope will be the most



delightful part of your life. Browning long ago sang, "The best



is yet to be," and, certainly, if world-wide fame troops of



friends, a consciousness of well-spent years, and a great career



filled with righteous achievement are constituents of happiness,



you have everything that the heart of man could wish.             



       Yours faithfully,                     



(Signed) JOHN HAY.  







His Excellency ANDREW D. WHITE, etc., etc., etc.











FROM THE CHANCELLOR OF THE GERMAN EMPIRE.



                               Wilhelm Str. 77.







MY DEAR AMBASSADOR:







On the occasion of this memorable day, I beg to send you my best



wishes. May God grant you perfect health and happiness. Be



assured that I always shall remember the excellent relations



which have joined us during so many years, and accept the



assurance of the highest esteem and respect of your most



affectionate                                         



BULOW.

CHAPTER XLIV







MY RECOLLECTIONS OF WILLIAM II--1879-1903







At various times since my leaving the Berlin Embassy various



friends have said to me, "Why not give us something definite



regarding the German Emperor?" And on my pleading sundry



difficulties and objections, some of my advisers have recalled



many excellent precedents, both American and foreign, and others



have cited the dictum, "The man I don't like is the man I don't



know."







The latter argument has some force with me. Much ill feeling



between the United States and Germany has had its root in



misunderstandings; and, as one of the things nearest my heart



since my student days has been a closer moral and intellectual



relation between the two countries, there is, perhaps, a reason



for throwing into these misunderstandings some light from my own



experience.







My first recollections of the present Emperor date from the



beginning of my stay as minister at Berlin, in 1879. The official



presentations to the Emperor and Empress of that period having



been made, there came in regular order those to the crown prince



and princess, and on my way to them there fell into my hands a



newspaper account of the unveiling of the monument to the eminent



painter Cornelius, at Dusseldorf, the main personage in the



ceremony being the young Prince William, then a student at Bonn.



His speech was given at some length, and it impressed me. There



was a certain reality of conviction and aspiration in it which



seemed to me so radically different from the perfunctory



utterances usual on such occasions that, at the close of the



official interview with his father and mother, I alluded to it.



Their response touched me. There came at once a kindly smile upon



the father's face, and a glad sparkle into the mother's eyes:



pleasing was it to hear her, while showing satisfaction and



pride, speak of her anxiety before the good news came, and of the



embarrassments in the way of her son at his first public address



on an occasion of such importance; no less pleasing was it to



note the father's happy acquiescence: there was in it all a



revelation of simple home feeling and of wholesome home ties



which clearly indicated something different from the family



relations in sundry royal houses depicted by court chroniclers.







Not long afterward the young prince appeared at some of the court



festivities, and I had many opportunities to observe him. He



seemed sprightly, with a certain exuberance of manner in meeting



his friends which was not unpleasing; but it was noticeable that



his hearty salutations were by no means confined to men and women



of his own age; he was respectful to old men, and that is always



a good sign; it could be easily seen, too, that while he



especially sought the celebrities of the Franco-Prussian War, he



took pains to show respect to men eminent in science, literature,



and art. There seemed a healthy, hearty life in him well



befitting a young man of his position and prospects: very



different was he from the heir to the throne in another country,



whom I had occasion to observe at similar functions, and who



seemed to regard the whole human race with indifference.







Making the usual visits in Berlin society, I found that people



qualified to judge had a good opinion of his abilities; and not



infrequent were prophecies that the young man would some day



really accomplish something.







My first opportunity to converse with him came at his marriage,



when a special reception was given by him and his bride to the



diplomatic corps. He spoke at considerable length on American



topics--on railways, steamers, public works, on Americans whom he



had met, and of the things he most wished to see on our side the



water; altogether he seemed to be broad-minded, alert, with a



quick sense of humor, and yet with a certain solidity of judgment



beneath it all.







After my departure from Berlin there flitted over to America



conflicting accounts of him, and during the short reign of his



father there was considerable growth of myth and legend to his



disadvantage. Any attempt to distil the truth from it all would



be futile; suffice it that both in Germany and Great Britain



careful statements by excellent authorities on both sides have



convinced me that in all that trying crisis the young man's



course was dictated by a manly sense of duty.







The first thing after his accession which really struck me as a



revelation of his character was his dismissal of Bismarck. By



vast numbers of people this was thought the act of an exultant



young ruler eager to escape all restraint, and this opinion was



considerably promoted in English-speaking countries by an



ephemeral cause: Tenniel's cartoon in "Punch" entitled "Dropping



the Pilot." As most people who read this will remember, the iron



chancellor was therein represented as an old, weatherbeaten



pilot, in storm-coat and sou'wester, plodding heavily down the



gangway at the side of a great ship; while far above him, leaning



over the bulwarks, was the young Emperor, jaunty, with a



satisfied smirk, and wearing his crown. There was in that little



drawing a spark of genius, and it sped far; probably no other



cartoon in "Punch" ever produced so deep an effect, save,



possibly, that which appeared during the Crimean War with the



legend "General February turned Traitor"; it went everywhere,



appealing to deep sentiment in human hearts.







And yet, to me--admiring Bismarck as the greatest German since



Luther, but reflecting upon the vast interests involved--this act



was a proof that the young monarch was a stronger man than any



one had supposed him to be. Certainly this dismissal must have



caused him much regret; all his previous life had shown that he



admired Bismarck--almost adored him. It gave evidence of a deep



purpose and a strong will. Louis XIV had gained great credit



after the death of Mazarin by declaring his intention of ruling



alone--of taking into his own hands the vast work begun by



Richelieu; but that was the merest nothing compared to this. This



was, apparently, as if Louis XIII, immediately after the triumphs



of Richelieu, had dismissed him and declared his purpose of



henceforth being his own prime minister. The young Emperor had



found himself at the parting of the ways, and had deliberately



chosen the right path, and this in spite of almost universal



outcries at home and abroad. The OLD Emperor William could let



Bismarck have his way to any extent: when his chancellor sulked



he could drive to the palace in the Wilhelmstrasse, pat his old



servant on the back, chaff him, scold him, laugh at him, and set



him going again, and no one thought less of the old monarch on



that account. But for the YOUNG Emperor William to do this would



be fatal; it would class him at once among the rois



fatneants--the mere figureheads--"the solemnly constituted



impostors," and in this lay not merely dangers to the young



monarch, but to his dynasty and to the empire.







His recognition of this fact was, and is, to me a proof that the



favorable judgments of him which I had heard expressed in Berlin



were well founded.







But this decision did much to render him unpopular in the United



States, and various other reports which flitted over increased



the unfavorable feeling. There came reports of his speeches to



young recruits, in which, to put it mildly, there was preached a



very high theory of the royal and imperial prerogative, and a



very exacting theory of the duty of the subject. Little account



was taken by distant observers of the fundamental facts in the



case; namely, that Germany, being a nation with no natural



frontiers, with hostile military nations on all sides, and with



serious intestine tendencies to anarchy, must, if she is to live,



have the best possible military organization and a central power



strong to curb all the forces of the empire, and quick to hurl



them. Moreover, these speeches, which seemed so absurd to the



average American, hardly astonished any one who had lived long in



Germany, and especially in Prussia. The doctrines laid down by



the young monarch to the recruits were, after all, only what they



had heard a thousand times from pulpit and school desk, and are a



logical result of Prussian history and geography. Something, too,



must be allowed to a young man gifted, energetic, suddenly



brought into so responsible a position, looking into and beyond



his empire, seeing hostile nations north, south, east, and west,



with elements of unreason fermenting within its own borders, and



feeling that the only reliance of his country is in the good



right arms of its people, in their power of striking heavily and



quickly, and in unquestioning obedience to authority.







In the history of American opinion at this time there was one



comical episode. The strongholds of opinion among us friendly to



Germany have been, for the last sixty years, our universities and



colleges, in so many of which are professors and tutors who,



having studied in Germany, have brought back a certain love for



the German fatherland. To them there came in those days a curious



tractate by a little-known German professor--one of the most



curious satires in human history. To all appearance it was simply



a biographical study of the young Roman emperor Caligula. It



displayed the advantages he had derived from a brave and pious



imperial ancestry, and especially from his devout and gifted



father; it showed his natural gifts and acquired graces, his



versatility, his growing restlessness, his manifold ambitions,



his contempt of wise counsel, the dismissal of his most eminent



minister, his carelessness of thoughtful opinion, his meddling in



anything and everything, his displays in the theater and in the



temples of the gods, his growth--until the world recognized him



simply as a beast of prey, a monster. The whole narrative was so



managed that the young prince who had just come to the German



throne seemed the exact counterpart of the youthful Roman



monarch--down to the cruel stage of his career; THAT was left to



anticipation. The parallels and resemblances between the two were



arranged with consummate skill, and whenever there was a passage



which seemed to present an exact chronicle of some well-known



saying or doing of the modern ruler there would follow an



asterisk with a reference to a passage in Tacitus or Suetonius or



Dion Cassius or other eminent authority exactly warranting the



statement. This piece of historical jugglery ran speedily through



thirty editions, while from all parts of Germany came refutations



and counter-refutations by scores, all tending to increase its



notoriety. Making a short tour through Germany at that period,



and stopping in a bookseller's shop at Munich to get a copy of



this treatise, I was shown a pile of pamphlets which it had



called out, at least a foot high. Comically enough, its author



could not be held responsible for it, since the name of the young



Emperor William was never mentioned; all it claimed to give or



did give was the life of Caligula, and certainly there was no



crime in writing a condemnatory history of him or any other



imperial miscreant who died nearly two thousand years ago. In the



American colleges and universities this tractate doubtless made



good friends of Germany uneasy, and it even shocked some



excellent men who knew much of Roman history and little of



mankind; but gradually common sense resumed its sway. As men



began to think they began to realize that the modern German



Empire resembles in no particular that debased and corrupt mass



with which the imperial Roman wretches had to do, and that the



new German sovereign, in all his characteristics and tendencies



is radically a different being from any one of the crazy beasts



of prey who held the imperial power during the decline of Rome.







Sundry epigrams had also come over to us; among others, the



characterization of the three German Emperors: the first William



as "Der greise Kaiser," the Emperor Frederick as "Der weise



Kaiser," and the second William as "Der Reise Kaiser"; and there



were unpleasant murmurs regarding sundry trials for petty



treason. But at the same time there was evident, in the midst of



American jokes at the young Emperor's expense, a growing feeling



that there was something in him; that, at any rate, he was not a



fat-witted, Jesuit-ridden, mistress-led monarch of the old



Bourbon or Hapsburg sort; that he had "go" in him--some fine



impulses, evidently; and here and there a quotation from a speech



showed insight into the conditions of the present world and



aspiration for its betterment.







In another chapter I have given a general sketch of the



conversation at my first presentation to him as ambassador; it



strengthened in my mind the impression already formed,--that he



was not a monarch of the old pattern. The talk was not



conventional; he was evidently fond of discoursing upon



architecture, sculpture, and music, but not less gifted in



discussing current political questions, and in various



conversations afterward this fact was observable. Conventional



talk was reduced to a minimum; the slightest hint was enough to



start a line of remark worth listening to.







Opportunities for conversation were many. Besides the usual



"functions" of various sorts, there were interviews by special



appointment, and in these the young monarch was neither backward



in presenting his ideas nor slow in developing them. The range of



subjects which interested him seemed unlimited, but there were



some which he evidently preferred: of these were all things



relating to ships and shipping, and one of the first subjects



which came up in conversations between us was the books of



Captain Mahan, which he discussed very intelligently, awarding



great praise to their author, and saying that he required all his



naval officers to read them.







Another subject in order was art in all its developments. During



the first years of my stay he was erecting the thirty-two



historical groups on the Avenue of Victory in the Thiergarten,



near my house. My walks took me frequently by them, and they



interested me, not merely by their execution, but by their



historical purpose, commemorating as they do the services of his



predecessors, and of the strongest men who made their reigns



significant during nearly a thousand years. He was always ready



to discuss these works at length, whether from the artistic,



historical, or educational point of view. Not only to me, but to



my wife he insisted on their value as a means of arousing



intelligent patriotism in children and youth. He dwelt with pride



on the large number of gifted sculptors in his realm, and his



comments on their work were worth listening to. He himself has



artistic gifts which in his earlier days were shown by at least



one specimen of his work as a painter in the Berlin Annual



Exhibition; and in the window of a silversmith's shop on the



Linden I once saw a prize cup for a yacht contest showing much



skill in invention and beauty in form, while near it hung the



pencil drawing for it in his own hand.







His knowledge of music and love for it have been referred to



elsewhere in these chapters. Noteworthy was it that his feeling



was not at all for music of a thin, showy sort; he seemed to be



touched by none of the prevailing fashions, but to cherish a



profound love for the really great things in music. This was



often shown, as, for example, at the concert at Potsdam to which



he invited President and Mrs. Harrison, and in his comments upon



the pieces then executed. But the most striking evidence of it



was the music in the Royal Chapel. It has been given me to hear



more than once the best music of the Sistine Pauline, and Lateran



choirs at Rome, of the three great choirs at St. Petersburg, of



the chorus at Bayreuth, and of other well-known assemblages under



high musical direction; but the cathedral choir at Berlin, in its



best efforts, surpassed any of these, and the music, both



instrumental and choral, which reverberates under the dome of the



imperial chapel at the great anniversaries there celebrated is



nowhere excelled. For operatic music of the usual sort he seemed



to care little. If a gala opera was to be given, the chances were



that he would order the performance of some piece of more



historical than musical interest. Hence, doubtless, it was that



during my whole stay the opera at Dresden surpassed decidedly



that at Berlin, while in the higher realms of music Berlin



remained unequaled.







Dramatic art is another field in which he takes an enlightened



interest: he has great reason for doing so, both as a statesman



and as a man.







As a result of observation and reflection during a long life



which has touched public men and measures in wide variety, I



would desire for my country three things above all others, to



supplement our existing American civilization: from Great Britain



her administration of criminal justice; from Germany her theater;



and from any European country, save Russia, Spain, and Turkey,



its government of cities.







As to the second of these desired contributions, ten years in



Germany at various periods during an epoch covering now nearly



half a century have convinced me that her theater, next after her



religious inheritance, gives the best stimulus and sustenance to



the better aspirations of her people. Through it, and above all



by Schiller, the Kantian ethics have been brought into the



thinking of the average man and woman; and not only Schiller, but



Lessing, Goethe, Gutzkow, and a long line of others have given an



atmosphere in which ennobling ideals bloom for the German youth,



during season after season, as if in the regular course of



nature. The dramatic presentation, even in the smallest towns,



is, as a rule, good; the theater and its surroundings are, in the



main, free from the abuses and miseries of the stage in



English-speaking lands, and, above all, from that all-pervading



lubricity and pornographic stench which have made the French



theater of the last half of the nineteenth century a main cause



in the decadence of the French people. In most German towns of



importance one finds the drama a part of the daily life of its



citizens--ennobling in its higher ranges, and in its influence



clean and wholesome.







It may be added that in no city of any English-speaking country



is Shakspere presented so fully, so well, and to such large and



appreciative audiences as in Berlin. All this, and more, the



Emperor knows, and he acts upon his knowledge. Interesting was it



at various times to see him sitting with his older children at



the theater, evidently awakening their interest in dramatic



masterpieces; and among these occasions there come back to me,



especially, the evenings when he thus sat, evidently discussing



with them the thought and action in Shakspere's "Julius Caesar"



and "Coriolanus," as presented on the stage before us. I could



well imagine his comments on the venom of demagogues, on the



despotism of mobs, on the weaknesses of strong men, and on the



need, in great emergencies, of a central purpose and firm



control. His view of the true character and mission of the



theater he has given at various times, and one of his talks with



the actors in the Royal Theater, shortly after my arrival, may be



noted as typical. In it occur passages like the following: "When



I came into the government, ten years ago, . . . I was convinced



that this theater, under the guidance of the monarch, should,



like the school and the university, have as its mission the



development of the rising generation, the promotion of the



highest intellectual good in our German fatherland, and the



ennobling of our people in mind and character.... I beg of you



that you continue to stand by me, each in his own way and place,



serving the spirit of idealism, and waging war against



materialism and all un-German corruptions of the stage."







After various utterances showing his steady purpose in the same



direction, there came out, in one of the later years of my stay,



sundry remarks of his showing a new phase of the same thought, as



follows: "The theater should not only be an important factor in



education and in the promotion of morals, but it should also



present incarnations of elegance, of beauty, of the highest



conceptions of art; it should not discourage us with sad pictures



of the past, with bitter awakenings from illusions, but be



purified, elevated, strengthened for presenting the ideal. . . .



Our ordinary life gives us every day the most mournful realities,



and the modern authors whose pleasure it is to bring these before



us upon the stage have accepted an unhealthy mission and



accomplish a discouraging work."







In his desire to see the theater aid in developing German ideals



and in enriching German life, he has promoted presentations of



the great episodes and personages in German history. Some of



these, by Wildenbruch and Lauff, permeated with veins of true



poetry, are attractive and ennobling. Of course not all were



entirely successful. I recall one which glorified especially a



great epoch in the history of the house of Hohenzollern, the



comical effect of which on one of my diplomatic colleagues I have



mentioned elsewhere; but this, so far as my experience goes, was



an exception.







There seems much reason for the Emperor's strenuous endeavors in



this field. The German theater still remains more wholesome than



that of any other country, but I feel bound to say that, since my



earlier acquaintance with it, from 1854 to 1856 and from 1879 to



1881, there has come some deterioration, and this is especially



shown in various dramas which have been held up as triumphs. In



these, an inoculation from the French drama seems to have



resulted in destruction of the nobler characteristics of the



German stage. One detects the cant of Dumas, fils, but not his



genius; and, when this cant is mingled with German pessimism, it



becomes at times unspeakably repulsive. The zeal for this new



drama seems to me a fad, and rather a slimy fad. With all my



heart I wish the Emperor success in his effort to keep the German



stage upon the higher planes.







Another subject which came up from time to time was that of



archaelogical investigation. Once, in connection with some talk



on German railway enterprises in Asia Minor, I touched upon his



great opportunities to make his reign illustrious by services to



science in that region. He entered into the subject heartily; it



was at once evident that he was awake to its possibilities, and



he soon showed me much more than I knew before of what had been



done and was doing, but pointed out special difficulties in



approaching, at present, some most attractive fields of



investigation.







Interesting also were his views on education, and more than once



the conversation touched this ground. As to his own academic



training, there is ample testimony that he appreciated the main



classical authors whom he read in the gymnasium at Cassel; but it



was refreshing to hear and to read various utterances of his



against gerund-grinding and pedantry. He recognizes the fact that



the worst enemies of classical instruction in Germany, as,



indeed, elsewhere, have been they of its own household, and he



has stated this view as vigorously as did Sydney Smith in England



and Francis Wayland in America. Whenever he dwelt on this subject



the views which he presented at such length to the Educational



Commission were wont to come out with force and piquancy.







On one occasion our discussion turned upon physical education,



and especially upon the value to students of boating. As an old



Yale boating man, a member of the first crew which ever sent a



challenge to Harvard, and one who had occasion in the



administration of an American university to consider this form of



exercise from various standpoints, I may say that his view of its



merits and his way of promoting it seemed to me thoroughly



sensible.







From time to time some mention from me of city improvements



observed during my daily walks led to an interesting discussion.



The city of Berlin is wonderfully well governed, and exhibits all



those triumphs of modern municipal skill and devotion which are



so conspicuously absent, as a rule, from our American cities.



While his capital preserves its self-governing powers, it is



clear that he purposes to have his full say as to everything



within his jurisdiction. There were various examples of this, and



one of them especially interested me: the renovation of the



Thiergarten. This great park, virtually a gift of the



Hohenzollern monarchs, which once lay upon the borders of the



city, but is now in the very heart of it, had gradually fallen



far short of what it should have been. Even during my earlier



stays in Berlin it was understood that some of his predecessors,



and especially his father, had desired to change its copse-like



and swampy character and give it more of the features of a



stately park, but that popular opposition to any such change had



always shown itself too bitter and uncompromising. This seemed a



great pity, for while there were some fine trees, a great



majority of them were so crowded together that there was no



chance of broad, free growth either for trees or for shrubbery.



There was nothing of that exquisitely beautiful play, upon



expanses of green turf, of light and shade through wide-expanded



boughs and broad masses of foliage, which gives such delight in



any of the finer English or American parks. Down to about half a



dozen years since it had apparently been thought best not to



interfere, and even when attention was called to the dark, swampy



characteristics of much of the Thiergarten, the answer was that



it was best to humor the Berliners; but about the beginning of my



recent stay the young Emperor intervened with decision and force,



his work was thorough, and as my windows looked out over one



corner of this field of his operations, their progress interested



me, and they were alluded to from time to time in our



conversations. Interesting was it to note that his energy was



all-sufficient; the Berliners seemed to regard his activity as



Arabs regard a sand-storm,--as predestined and irresistible,--and



the universal verdict now justifies his course, both on sanitary



and artistic grounds.







The same thing may be said, on the whole, of the influence he has



exerted on the great adornments of his capital city. The position



and character of various monuments on which he has impressed his



ideas, and the laying out and decoration of sundry streets and



parks, do credit not merely to his artistic sense, but to his



foresight.







This prompt yet wise intervention, actuated by a public spirit



not only strong but intelligent, is seen, in various other parts



of the empire, in the preservation and restoration of its



architectural glories. When he announced to me at Potsdam his



intention to present specimens representative of German



architecture and sculpture to the Germanic Museum at Harvard, he



showed, in enumerating and discussing the restorations at



Marienburg and Naumburg, the bas-reliefs at Halberstadt, the



masks and statues of Andreas Schluter at Berlin, and the



Renaissance and rococo work at Lubeck and Danzig, a knowledge and



appreciation worthy of a trained architect and archaeologist.







As to his feeling for literature, his addresses on various



occasions show amply that he has read to good purpose, not only



in the best authors of his own, but of other countries. While



there is not the slightest tinge of pedantry in his speeches or



talk, there crop out in them evidences of a curious breadth and



universality in his reading. His line of reading for amusement



was touched when, at the close of an hour of serious official



business, an illustration of mine from Rudyard Kipling led him to



recall many of that author's most striking situations, into which



he entered with great zest; and at various other times he cited



sayings of Mark Twain which he seemed especially to enjoy. Here



it may be mentioned that one may note the same breadth in his



love for art; for not only does he rejoice in the higher



achievements of architecture, sculpture, and painting, but he



takes pleasure in lighter work, and an American may note that he



is greatly interested in the popular illustrations of Gibson.







I once asked some of the leading people nearest him how he found



time to observe so wide a range, and received answer that it was



as much a marvel to them as to me; he himself once told me that



he found much time for reading during his hunting excursions.







Nor does he make excursions into various fields of knowledge by



books alone. Any noteworthy discovery or gain in any leading



field of thought or effort attracts his attention at once, and



must be presented to him by some one who ranks among its foremost



exponents.







But here it should be especially noted that, active and original



as the Emperor is, he is not, and never has been, caught by FADS



either in art, science, literature, or in any other field of



human activity. The great artists who cannot draw or paint, and



who, therefore, despise those who can and are glorified by those



who cannot; the great composers who can give us neither harmony



nor melody, and therefore have a fanatical following among those



who labor under like disabilities; the great writers who are



unable to attain strength, lucidity, or beauty, and therefore



secure praise for profundity and occult wisdom,--none of these



influence him. In these, as in other things, the Hohenzollern



sanity asserts itself. He recognizes the fact that normal and



healthy progress is by an evolution of the better out of the



good, and that the true function of genius in every field is to



promote some phase of this evolution either by aiding to create a



better environment, or by getting sight of higher ideals.







As to his manner, it is in ordinary intercourse simple, natural,



kindly, and direct, and on great public occasions dignified



without the slightest approach to pomposity. I have known scores



of our excellent fellow-citizens in little offices who were



infinitely more assuming. It was once said of a certain United



States senator that "one must climb a ladder to speak with him";



no one would dream of making any assertion of this sort regarding



the present ruler of the Prussian Kingdom and German Empire.







But it would be unjust to suppose that minor gifts and



acquirements form the whole of his character; they are but a part



of its garb. He is certainly developing the characteristics of a



successful ruler of men and the solid qualities of a statesman.



It was my fortune, from time to time, to hear him discuss at some



length current political questions; and his views were presented



with knowledge, clearness, and force. There was nothing at all



flighty in any of his statements or arguments. There is evidently



in him a large fund of that Hohenzollern common sense which has



so often happily modified German, and even European, politics. He



recognizes, of course, as his ancestors generally have done, that



his is a military monarchy, and that Germany is and must remain a



besieged camp; hence his close attention to the army and navy.



Every one of our embassy military attaches expressed to me his



surprise at the efficiency of his inspections of troops, of his



discrimination between things essential and not essential, and of



his insight into current military questions. Even more striking



testimony was given to me by our naval attaches as to his minute



knowledge not only of his own navy, but of the navies of other



powers, and especially as to the capabilities of various classes



of ships and, indeed, of individual vessels. One thoroughly



capable of judging told me that he doubted whether there was any



admiral in our service who knew more about every American ship of



any importance than does the Kaiser. It has been said that his



devotion to the German navy is a whim. That view can hardly



command respect among those who have noted his labor for years



upon its development, and his utterances regarding its connection



with the future of his empire. As a simple matter of fact, he



recognizes the triumphs of German commercial enterprises, and



sees in them a guarantee for the extension of German power and



for a glory more permanent than any likely to be obtained by



military operations in these times. When any candid American



studies what has been done, or, rather, what has NOT been done,



in his own country, with its immense seacoast and its many



harbors on two oceans, to build up a great merchant navy, and



compares it with what has been accomplished during the last fifty



years by the steady, earnest, honest enterprise of Germany, with



merely its little strip of coast on a northern inland sea, and



with only the Hanseatic ports as a basis, he may well have



searchings of heart. The "Shipping Trust" seems to be the main



outcome of our activity, and lines of the finest steamers running



to all parts of the world the outcome of theirs. There is a



history here which we may well ponder; the young Emperor has not



only thought but acted upon it.







As to yet broader work, the crucial test of a ruler is his



ability to select MEN, to stand by them when he has selected



them, and to decide wisely how far the plans which he has thought



out, and they have thought out, can be fused into a policy worthy



of his country. Judged by this test, the young monarch would seem



worthy of his position; the men he has called to the various



ministries are remarkably fit for their places, several of them



showing very high capacity, and some of them genius.







As to his relation to the legislative bodies, it is sometimes



claimed that he has lost much by his too early and open



proclamation of his decisions, intentions, and wishes; and it can



hardly be denied that something must be pardoned to the ardor of



his patriotic desire to develop the empire in all its activities;



but, after all due allowance has been made, there remains



undeniable evidence of his statesmanlike ability to impress his



views upon the national and state legislatures. A leading member



of one of the parliamentary groups, very frequently in opposition



to government measures, said to me: "After all, it is impossible



for us to resist him; he knows Germany so well, and his heart is



so thoroughly in his proposals, that he is sure to gain his



points sooner or later."







An essential element of strength in this respect is his



acquaintance with men and things in every part of his empire.



Evidences of this were frequent in his public letters and



telegrams to cities, towns, groups, and individuals. Nor was it



"meddling and muddling." If any fine thing was done in any part



of the empire, he seemed the first to take notice of it. Typical



of his breadth of view were the cases of various ship captains



and others who showed heroism in remote parts of the world, his



telegram of hearty approval being usually the first thing they



received on coming within reach of it, and substantial evidence



of his gratitude meeting them later.







On the other hand, as to his faculty for minute observation and



prompt action upon it: a captain of one of the great liners



between Hamburg and New York told me that when his ship was ready



to sail the Emperor came on board, looked it over, and after



approving various arrangements said dryly, "Captain, I should



think you were too old a sailor to let people give square corners



to your tables." The captain quietly acted upon this hint; and



when, many months later, the Kaiser revisited the ship, he said,



"Well, captain, I am glad to see that you have rounded the



corners of your tables."







He is certainly a working man. The record of each of his days at



Berlin or Potsdam, as given in the press, shows that every hour,



from dawn to long after dusk, brings its duties--duties demanding



wide observation, close study, concentration of thought, and



decision. Nor is his attention bounded by German interests. He is



a keen student of the world at large. At various interviews there



was ample evidence of his close observation of the present



President of the United States, and of appreciation of his doings



and qualities; so, too, when the struggle for decent government



in New York was going on, he showed an intelligent interest in



Mr. Seth Low; and in various other American matters there was



recognition of the value of any important stroke of good work



done by our countrymen.







As to his view of international questions, two of the



opportunities above referred to especially occur to me here.







The first of these was during the troubles in Crete between the



Greeks and the Turks. As I talked one evening with one of my



colleagues who represented a power especially interested in the



matter, the Emperor came up and at once entered into the



discussion. He stated the position of various powers in relation



to it, and suggested a line of conduct. There was straightforward



good sense in his whole contention, a refreshing absence of



conventionalities, and a very clear insight into the realities of



the question, with a shrewd forecast of the result. More



interesting to me was another conversation, in the spring of



1899. As the time drew near for the sessions of the Peace



Conference at The Hague, I was making preparations for leaving



Berlin to take up my duty in that body, when one morning there



appeared at the embassy a special messenger from the Emperor



requesting me to come to the palace. My reception was hearty, and



he plunged at once into the general subject by remarking, "What



the conference will most need is good common sense; and I have



sent Count Munster, my ambassador at Paris, because he has lots



of it." With this preface, he went very fully into the questions



likely to come before the conference, speaking regarding the



attitude of the United States and the various powers of Europe



and Asia with a frankness, fullness, and pungency which at times



rather startled me. On the relations between the United States,



Germany, and Great Britain he was especially full. Very



suggestive also were his remarks regarding questions in the far



East, and especially on the part likely to be played by Japan and



China--the interests of various powers in these questions being



presented in various aspects, some of them decidedly original and



suggestive. While there were points on which we could hardly



agree, there were some suggestions which proved to be of especial



value, and to one of them is due the fact that on most questions



the German delegates at The Hague stood by the Americans, and



that on the most important question of all they finally, after a



wide divergence from our view, made common cause with Great



Britain and the United States. I regret that the time has not



come when it is permissible to give his conversation in detail;



it treated a multitude of current topics, and even burning



questions, with statesmanlike breadth, and at the same time with



the shrewdness of a man of the world. There were in it sundry



personal touches which interested me; among others, a statement



regarding Cecil Rhodes, the South African magnate, and a



reference to sundry doings and sayings of his own which had been



misrepresented, especially in England. One point in this was



especially curious. He said, "Some people find fault with me for



traveling so much; but this is part of my business: I try to know



my empire and my people, to see for myself what they need and



what is going on, what is doing and who are doing it. It is my



duty also to know men and countries outside the empire. I am not



like ----," naming a sovereign well known in history, "who never



stirred out of the house if he could help it, and so let men and



things go on as they pleased."







This union of breadth and minuteness in his view of his empire



and of the world is, perhaps, his most striking characteristic.



It may be safely said that, at any given moment, he knows



directly, or will shortly know, the person and work of every man



in his empire who is really taking the lead in anything worthy of



special study or close attention. The German court is considered



very exclusive, but one constantly saw at its assemblages men



noted in worthy fields from every part of Germany and, indeed, of



Europe. Herein is a great difference between the German and



Russian courts. If, during my official life at St. Petersburg, I



wished to make the acquaintance of a man noted in science,



literature, or art, he must be found at professorial gatherings



across the Neva. He rarely, if ever, appeared in the throng of



military and civil officials at the Winter Palace. But at Berlin



such men took an honored place at the court among those whom the



ruler sought out and was glad to converse with.







As to the world outside the empire, I doubt whether any other



sovereign equals him in personal acquaintance with leaders in



every field of worthy activity. It was interesting from time to



time to look over the official lists of his guests at breakfast,



or luncheon, or dinner, or supper, or at military exercises, or



at the theater; for they usually embraced men noted in civil,



ecclesiastical, or military affairs, in literature, science, art,



commerce, or industry from every nation. One class was



conspicuous by its absence at all such gatherings, large or



small; namely, the MERELY rich. Rich men there were, but they



were always men who had done something of marked value to their



country or to mankind; for the mere "fatty tumors" of the



financial world he evidently cared nothing.







A special characteristic in the German ruler is independence of



thought. This quality should not be confounded, as it often is,



with mere offhand decision based upon prejudices or whimsies. One



example, which I have given elsewhere, may be here referred to as



showing that his rapid judgments are based upon clear insight:



his OWN insight, and not that of others. On my giving him news of



the destruction of the Maine at Havana, he at once asked me



whether the explosion was from the outside; and from first to



last, against the opinions of his admirals and captains, insisted



that it must have been so.







He is certainly, in the opinion of all who know him,



impulsive--indeed, a very large proportion of his acts which



strike the attention of the world seem the result of impulse;



but, as a rule, it will be found that beneath these impulses is a



calm judgment. Even when this seems not to be the case, they are



likely to appeal all the more strongly to humanity at large.



Typical was his impulsive proposal to make up to the Regent of



Bavaria the art appropriation denied by sundry unpatriotic



bigots. Its immediate result was a temporary triumph for the



common enemy, but it certainly drew to the Emperor the hearts of



an immense number of people, not only inside, but outside his



empire; and, in the long run, it will doubtless be found to have



wrought powerfully for right reason. As an example of an



utterance of his which to many might seem to be the result of a



momentary impulse, but which reveals sober contemplation of



problems looming large before the United States as well as



Germany, I might cite a remark made last year to an American



eminent in public affairs. He said, "You in America may do what



you please, but I will not suffer capitalists in Germany to suck



the life out of the workingmen and then fling them like squeezed



lemon-skins into the gutter."







Any one who runs through the printed volume of his speeches will



see that he is fertile in ideas on many subjects, and knows how



to impress them upon his audiences. His voice and manner are



good, and at times there are evidences of deep feeling, showing



the man beneath the garb of the sovereign. This was especially



the case in his speech at the coming of age of his son. The



audience was noteworthy, there being present the Austrian



Emperor, members of all the great ruling houses of Europe the



foremost men in contemporary German history, and the diplomatic



representatives of foreign powers--an audience representing wide



differences in points of view and in lines of thought, yet no one



of them could fail to be impressed by sundry references to the



significance of the occasion.







Even the most rapid sketch of the Emperor would be inadequate



without some reference to his religious views. It is curious to



note that while Frederick the Great is one of the gods of his



idolatry, the two monarchs are separated by a whole orb of



thought in their religious theories and feelings. While a



philosophical observer may see in this the result of careful



training in view of the evident interests of the monarchy in



these days, he must none the less acknowledge the reality and



depth of those feelings in the present sovereign. No one who has



observed his conduct and utterances, and especially no one who



has read his sermon and prayer on the deck of one of his



war-ships just at the beginning of the Chinese war, can doubt



that there is in his thinking a genuine substratum of religious



feeling. It is true that at times one is reminded of the remark



made to an American ecclesiastic by an eminent German theological



professor regarding that tough old monarch, Frederick William I;



namely, that while he was deeply religious, his religion was "of



an Old Testament type." Of course, the religion of the present



Emperor is of a type vastly higher than that of his ancestor,



whose harshness to the youth who afterward became the great



Frederick has been depicted in the "Memoirs" of the Margravine of



Bayreuth; but there remains clearly in the religion of the



present Emperor a certain "Old Testament" character--a feeling of



direct reliance upon the Almighty, a consciousness of his own



part in guiding a chosen people, and a readiness, if need be, to



smite the Philistines. One phase of this feeling appears in the



music at the great anniversaries, when the leading men of the



empire are brought together beneath the dome of the Palace



Church. The anthems executed by the bands and choirs, and the



great chorals sung by the congregation, breathe anything but the



spirit of the Sermon on the Mount; they seem rather to echo the



grim old battle-hymns of the Thirty Years' War and the war in the



Netherlands.







And yet it must be said that there goes with this a remarkable



feeling of justice to his subjects of other confessions than his



own, and a still more remarkable breadth of view as regards the



relations of modern science to what is generally held as orthodox



theology. The fearlessness with which he recently summoned



Professor Delitzsch to unfold to him and to his family and court



the newly revealed relations of Assyrian research to biblical



study, which gave such alarm in highly orthodox circles, and his



fairness in estimating these researches, certainly revealed



breadth of mind as well as trust in what he considered the



fundamental verities of religion.







A good example of the curious union, in his mind, of religious



feeling, tolerance, and shrewd policy is shown in various



dealings with his Roman Catholic subjects.







Of course he is not ignorant that his very existence as King of



Prussia and German Emperor is a thorn in the side of the Roman



Curia; he knows, as every thinking German knows, that, with the



possible exception of the British monarchy, no other is so hated



by the Vatican monsignori as his own. He is perfectly aware of



the part taken in that quarter against his country and dynasty at



all times, and especially during the recent wars; and yet all



this seems not to influence him in the slightest as regards



justice to his Roman Catholic subjects. He does indeed, resist



the return of the Jesuits into the empire,--his keen insight



forbids him to imitate the policy of Frederick the Great in this



respect,--but his dealings with the Roman Catholic Church at



large show not merely wisdom but kindliness. If he felt bound to



resist, and did successfully resist, the efforts of Cardinal



Rampolla to undermine German rule and influence in Alsace and



Lorraine, there was a quiet fairness and justice in his action



which showed a vast deal of tolerant wisdom. His visits to the



old Abbey of Laach, his former relations with its young abbot,



his settlement of a vexed question by the transfer of the abbot



to the bishopric of Metz, his bringing of a loyal German into



episcopal power at Strasburg, his recent treatment of the prince



bishop of Breslau and the archbishop of Cologne, all show a wise



breadth of view. Perhaps one of the brightest diplomatic strokes



in his career was his dealing with a Vatican question during his



journey in the East. For years there had been growing up in world



politics the theory that France, no matter how she may deal with



monks and nuns and ultramontane efforts within her own immediate



boundaries, is their protector in all the world beside, and



especially in the Holy Land. The relation of this theory to the



Crimean War, fifty years ago, is one of the curious things of



history, and from that day to this it has seemed to be hardening



more and more into a fixed policy--even into something like a



doctrine of international law. Interesting was it, then, to see



the Emperor, on his visit to the Sultan, knock the ground from



under the feet of all this doctrine by securing for the Roman



Catholic interest at Jerusalem what the French had never been



able to obtain--the piece of ground at the Holy City, so long



coveted by pious Catholics, whereon, according to tradition, once



stood the lodging of the Virgin Mary. This the Emperor quietly



obtained of the Sultan, and, after assisting at the dedication of



a Lutheran church at Jerusalem, he telegraphed to the Pope and to



other representatives of the older church that he had made a gift



of this sacred site to those who had so long and so ardently



desired it.







Considerable criticism has been made on the score of his evident



appreciation of his position, and his theory of his relation to



it; but when his point of view is cited, one perhaps appreciates



it more justly. I have already shown this point of view in the



account of the part taken by him at the two-hundredth anniversary



of the Royal Academy, and of his remark, afterward, contrasting



his theory of monarchy with that of Dom Pedro of Brazil. Jocose



as was the manner of it, it throws light upon his idea of his



duty in the state. While a constitutional monarch, he is not so



in the British sense. British constitutional monarchy is made



possible by the "silver streak"; but around the German Empire, as



every German feels in his heart, is no "silver streak." This fact



should be constantly borne in mind by those who care really to



understand the conditions of national existence on the continent



of Europe. Herein lies the answer to one charge that has been so



often made against the German Emperor--of undue solicitude



regarding his official and personal position, as shown in sundry



petty treason trials. The simple fact is that German public



opinion, embodied in German law, has arrived at the conclusion



that it is not best to allow the head of the state to be the



sport of every crank or blackguard who can wield a pen or pencil.



The American view, which allowed Lincoln, Garfield, and McKinley



to be attacked in all the moods and tenses of vituperation, and



to be artistically portrayed as tyrants, drunkards, clowns,



beasts of prey, and reptiles, has not yet been received into



German modes of thought. Luther said that he "would not suffer



any man to treat the Gospel as a sow treats a sack of oats"; and



that seems to be the feeling inherent in the German mind



regarding the treatment of those who represent the majesty of the



nation.







And here a word regarding the relation of Kaiser and people. In



one of the letters to John Adams written by Thomas Jefferson as



they both were approaching the close of life, the founder of



American democracy declared that he had foreseen the failure of



French popular rule, and had therefore favored in France,



democrat though he was, a constitutional monarchy. Had Jefferson



lived in our time, he would doubtless have arrived at a similar



conclusion regarding Germany, for he would have taken account of



the difference between a country like ours, with no long period



of history which had given to dominant political ideas a



religious character,--a country stretching from ocean to ocean,



with no neighbors to make us afraid, --and a country like



Germany, with an ancient historic head, with no natural



frontiers, and beset on every side by enemies; and Jefferson



would doubtless have taken account also of the fact that, were



the matter submitted to popular vote, the present sovereign, with



his present powers, would be the choice of an overwhelming



majority of the German people. The German imperial system, like



our own American republican system, is the result of an evolution



during many generations--an evolution which has produced the



present government, decided its character, fixed its form,



allotted its powers, and decided on the men at the head of it;



and this fact an American, no matter how devoted to republicanism



and democracy in his own country, may well acknowledge to be as



fixed in the political as in the physical world.







Of course some very bitter charges have been made against him as



regards Germany, the main one being that he does not love



parliamentary government and has, at various times, infringed



upon the constitution of the empire.







As to loving parliamentary government, he would probably say that



he cannot regard a system as final which, while attaching to the



front of the chariot of progress a full team to pull it forward,



attaches another team to the rear to pull it backward. But



whatever his theory, he has in practice done his best to promote



the efficiency of parliamentary government, and to increase



respect for it in his kingdom of Prussia, by naming as life



members of the Senate sundry men of the highest character and of



immense value in the discussion of the most important questions.



Two of these, appointed during my stay, I knew and admired. The



first, Professor Gustav Schmoller, formerly rector of the



University of Berlin, is one of the leading economists of the



world, who has shown genius in studying and exhibiting the



practical needs of the German people, and in discerning the best



solutions of similar problems throughout the world--profound,



eloquent, conciliatory, sure to be of immense value as a senator.



The second, Professor Slaby, director of the great technical



institution of Germany at Charlottenburg, is one of the leading



authorities of the world on everything that pertains to the



applications of electricity, a great administrator, a wise



counselor on questions pertaining to the German educational



system. Neither of these men orates, but both are admirable



speakers, and are sure to be of incalculable value. I name them



simply as types: others were appointed, equally distinguished in



other fields. If, then, the Emperor is blamed for not liking



parliamentary and party government, it is only fair to say that



he has taken the surest way to give it strength and credit.







As to the alleged violations of the German constitution, the



same, in a far higher degree, were charged against Kaiser William



I and Bismarck,--and these charges were true,--but it is also



true that thereby those men saved and built up their country. As



a matter of fact, the intuitive sense as well as the reflective



powers of Germans seem to show them that the real dangers to



their country come from a very different quarter--from men who



promote hatreds of race, class, and religion within the empire,



and historic international hatreds without it.







So, too, various charges have been made against the Emperor as



regards the United States. From time to time there came, during



my stay, statements in sundry American newspapers, some



belligerent, some lacrymose, regarding his attitude toward our



country. It seemed to be taken for granted by many good people



during our Spanish War that the Emperor was personally against



us. It is not unlikely that he may have felt sympathy for that



forlorn, widowed Queen Regent of Spain, making so desperate a



struggle to save the kingdom for her young son; if so, he but



shared a feeling common to a very large part of humanity, for



certainly there have been few more pathetic situations; but that



he really cared anything for the success of Spain is exceedingly



doubtful. The Hohenzollern common sense in him must have been for



years vexed at the folly and fatuity of Spanish policy. He



probably inherits the feeling of his father, who, when visiting



the late Spanish monarch some years before his death, showed a



most kindly personal feeling toward Spain and its ruler, and an



intense interest in various phases of art developed in the



Spanish peninsula; but, in his diary, let fall remarks which show



his feeling toward the whole existing Spanish system. One of



these I recall especially. Passing a noted Spanish town, he



remarks: "Here are ten churches, twenty monasteries, and not a



single school." No Hohenzollern is likely to waste much sympathy



on a nation which brings on its fate by preferring monasticism to



education; and never during the Spanish War did he or his



government, to my knowledge, show the slightest leaning toward



our enemies. Certain it is that when sundry hysterical publicists



and meddlesome statesmen of the Continent proposed measures



against what they thought the dangerous encroachments of our



Republic, he quietly, but resolutely and effectually, put his



foot upon them.







Another complaint sometimes heard in America really amounts to



this: that the Emperor is pushing German interests in all parts



of the world, and is not giving himself much trouble about the



interests of other countries. There is truth in this, but the



complainants evidently never stop to consider that every thinking



man in every nation would despise him were it otherwise.







Yet another grievance, a little time since, was that, apparently



with his approval, his ships of war handled sundry Venezuelans



with decided roughness. This was true enough and ought to warm



every honest man's heart.







The main facts in the case were these: a petty equatorial



"republic," after a long series of revolutions,--one hundred and



four in seventy years, Lord Lansdowne tells us, --was enjoying



peace and the beginnings of prosperity. Thanks to the United



States, it had received from an international tribunal the



territory to which it was entitled, was free from disturbance at



home or annoyance abroad, and was under a regular government



sanctioned by its people. Suddenly, an individual started another



so-called "revolution." He was the champion of no reform,



principle, or idea; he simply represented the greed of himself



and a pack of confederates whose ideal was that of a gang of



burglars. With their aid he killed, plundered, or terrorized



until he got control of the government--or, rather, became



himself the government. Under the name of a "republic" he erected



a despotism and usurped powers such as no Russian autocrat would



dare claim. Like the men of his sort who so often afflict



republics in the equatorial regions of South America, he had no



hesitation in confiscating the property and taking the lives, not



only of such of his fellow-citizens as he thought dangerous to



himself, but also of those whom he thought likely to become so.



He made the public treasury his own, and doubtless prepared the



way, as so many other patriots of his sort in such "republics"



have done, for retirement into a palace at Paris, with ample



funds for enjoying the pleasures of that capital, after he, like



so many others, shall have been, in turn, kicked out of his



country by some new bandit stronger than he.







So far so good. If the citizens of Venezuela like or permit that



sort of thing, outside nations have no call to interfere; but



this petty despot, having robbed, maltreated, and even murdered



citizens of his own country, proceeded to maltreat and rob



citizens of other countries and, among them, those of the German



Empire. He was at first asked in diplomatic fashion to desist and



to make amends, but for such appeals he simply showed contempt.



His purpose was evidently to plunder all German subjects within



his reach, and to cheat all German creditors beyond his reach. At



this the German Government, as every government in similar



circumstances is bound to do, demanded redress and sent ships to



enforce the demand. This was perfectly legitimate; but



immediately there arose in the United States an outcry against a



"violation of the Monroe Doctrine." As a matter of fact, the



Monroe Doctrine was no more concerned in the matter than was the



doctrine of the Perseverance of the Saints; but there was enough



to start an outcry against Germany, and so it began to spread.



The Germans were careful to observe the best precedents in



international law, yet every step they took was exhibited in



sundry American papers as a menace to the United States. There



was no more menace to the United States than to the planet



Saturn. The conduct of the German Government was in the interest



of the United States as well as of every other decent government.



Finally, the soldiers in a Venezuelan fort wantonly fired upon a



German war vessel--whereupon the commander of the ship, acting



entirely in accordance, not only with international law, but with



natural right, defended himself, and knocked the fort about the



ears of those who occupied it, thus giving the creatures who



directed them a lesson which ought to rejoice every thinking



American. At this the storm on paper against Germany, both in



America and Great Britain, broke out with renewed violence, and



there was more talk about dangers to the Monroe Doctrine. As one



who, at The Hague Conference, was able to do something for



recognition of the Monroe Doctrine by European powers, and who,



as a member of the Venezuelan Commission, did what was possible



to secure justice to Venezuela, I take this opportunity to



express the opinion that the time has come for plain speaking in



this matter. Even with those of us who believe in the Monroe



Doctrine there begins to arise a question as to which are nearest



the interests and the hearts of Americans,--the sort of "dumb



driven cattle" who allow themselves to be governed by such men as



now control Venezuela, or the people of Germany and other



civilized parts of Europe, as well as those of the better South



American republics, like Chile, the Argentine Republic, Brazil,



and others, whose interests, aspirations, ideals, and feelings



are so much more closely akin to our own.







Occasionally, too, there have arisen plaintive declarations that



the Emperor does not love the United States or admire its



institutions. As to that I never saw or heard of anything showing



dislike to our country; but, after all, he is a free man, and



there is nothing in international law or international comity



requiring him to love the United States; it is sufficient that he



respects what is respectable in our government and people, and we



may fairly allow to him his opinion on sundry noxious and



nauseous developments among us which we hope may prove temporary.



As to admiring our institutions, he is probably not fascinated by



our lax administration of criminal justice, which leaves at large



more unpunished criminals, and especially murderers, than are to



be found in any other part of the civilized world, save,



possibly, some districts of lower Italy and Sicily. He probably



does not admire Tammany Hall or the Philadelphia Ring, and has



his own opinion of cities which submit to such tyranny; quite



likely he has not been favorably impressed by the reckless waste



and sordid jobbery recently revealed at St. Louis and



Minneapolis; it is exceedingly doubtful whether he admires some



of the speeches on national affairs made for the "Buncombe



district" and the galleries; but that he admires and respects the



men in the United States who do things worth doing, and say



things worth saying; that he takes a deep interest in those



features of our policy, or achievements of our people, which are



to our credit; that he enjoys the best of our literature; that he



respects every true American soldier and sailor, every American



statesman or scholar or writer or worker of any sort who really



accomplishes anything for our country, is certain.







To sum up his position in contemporary history: As the German



nation is the result of an evolution of individual and national



character in obedience to resistless inner forces and to its



environment, so out of the medley of imperial and royal



Hohenstaufens, Hapsburgs, Wittelsbachs, Wettins, Guelphs, and the



like, have arisen, as by a survival of the fittest, the



Hohenzollerns. These have given to the world various strong



types, and especially such as the Great Elector, Frederick II,



and William I. Mainly under them and under men trained or



selected by them, Germany, from a great confused mass of warriors



and thinkers and workers, militant at cross-purposes, wearing



themselves out in vain struggles, and preyed upon by malevolent



neighbors, has become a great power in arms, in art, in science,



in literature; a fortress of high thought; a guardian of



civilization; the natural ally of every nation which seeks the



better development of humanity. And the young monarch who is now



at its head--original, yet studious of the great men and deeds of



the past; brave, yet conciliatory; never allowing the mail-clad



fist to become unnerved, but none the less devoted to the



conquests of peace; standing firmly on realities, but with a



steady vision of ideals--seems likely to add a new name to the



list of those who, as leaders of Germany, have advanced the



world.















CHAPTER XLV







AS PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN DELEGATION AT THE PEACE CONFERENCE



OF THE HAGUE: I--1899







On the 24th of August, 1898, the Russian Government proposed, in



the name of the Emperor Nicholas II, a conference which should



seek to arrest the constantly increasing development of armaments



and thus contribute to a durable peace; and on the 11th of



January, 1899, his minister of foreign affairs, Count Mouravieff,



having received favorable answers to this proposal, sent forth a



circular indicating the Russian view as to subjects of



discussion. As to the place of meeting, there were obvious



reasons why it should not be the capital of one of the greater



powers. As to Switzerland, the number of anarchists and nihilists



who had taken refuge there, and the murder of the Empress of



Austria by one of them shortly before, at Geneva, in broad



daylight, had thrown discredit over the ability of the Swiss



Government to guarantee safety to the conference; the Russian



Government therefore proposed that its sessions be held at The



Hague, and this being agreed to, the opening was fixed for the



18th of May.







From the first there was a misunderstanding throughout the world



as to what the Emperor Nicholas really proposed. Far and near it



was taken for granted that he desired a general disarmament, and



this legend spread rapidly. As a matter of fact, this was neither



his proposal nor his purpose; the measures he suggested being



designed "to put an end to the constantly increasing development



of armaments."







At the outset I was skeptical as to the whole matter. What I had



seen of the Emperor Nicholas during my stay in Russia had not



encouraged me to expect that he would have the breadth of view or



the strength of purpose to carry out the vast reforms which



thinking men hoped for. I recalled our conversation at my



reception as minister, when, to my amazement, he showed himself



entirely ignorant of the starving condition of the peasantry



throughout large districts in the very heart of the empire.[8]



That he was a kindly man, wishing in a languid way the good of



his country, could not be doubted; but the indifference to



everything about him evident in all his actions, his lack of



force even in the simplest efforts for the improvement of his



people, and, above all, his yielding to the worst elements in his



treatment of the Baltic provinces and Finland, did not encourage



me to believe that he would lead a movement against the enormous



power of the military party in his vast empire. On this account,



when the American newspapers prophesied that I was to be one of



the delegates, my feelings were strongly against accepting any



such post. But in due time the tender of it came in a way very



different from anything I had anticipated: President McKinley



cabled a personal request that I accept a position on the



delegation, and private letters from very dear friends, in whose



good judgment I had confidence, gave excellent reasons for my



doing so. At the same time came the names of my colleagues, and



this led me to feel that the delegation was to be placed on a



higher plane than I had expected. In the order named by the



President, they were as follows: Andrew D. White; Seth Low,



President of Columbia University; Stanford Newel, Minister at The



Hague; Captain Mahan, of the United States navy; Captain Crozier,



of the army; and the Hon. Frederick W. Holls as secretary. In



view of all this, I accepted.











[8] See account of this conversation in "My Mission to Russia,"



Chapter XXXIII, pp. 9-10.











Soon came evidences of an interest in the conference more earnest



and wide-spread than anything I had dreamed. Books, documents,



letters, wise and unwise, thoughtful and crankish, shrewd and



childish, poured in upon me; in all classes of society there



seemed fermenting a mixture of hope and doubt; even the German



Emperor apparently felt it, for shortly there came an invitation



to the palace, and on my arrival I found that the subject



uppermost in his mind was the approaching conference. Of our



conversation, as well as of some other interviews at this period,



I speak elsewhere.







On the 16th of May I left Berlin, and arrived late in the evening



at The Hague. As every day's doings were entered in my diary, it



seems best to give an account of this part of my life in the



shape of extracts from it.











May 17, 1899.







This morning, on going out of our hotel, the Oude Doelen, I found



that since my former visit, thirty-five years ago, there had been



little apparent change. It is the same old town, quiet,



picturesque, full of historical monuments and art treasures. This



hotel and the neighboring streets had been decorated with the



flags of various nations, including our own, and crowds were



assembled under our windows and in the public places. The hotel



is in one of the most attractive parts of the city



architecturally and historically, and is itself interesting from



both points of view. It has been a hostelry ever since the middle



ages, and over the main entrance a tablet indicates rebuilding in



1625. Connected with it by interior passages are a number of



buildings which were once private residences, and one of the



largest and best of these has been engaged for us. Fortunately



the present Secretary of State, John Hay, has been in the



diplomatic service; and when I wrote him, some weeks ago, on the



importance of proper quarters being secured for us, he entered



heartily into the matter, giving full powers to the minister here



to do whatever was necessary, subject to my approval. The result



is that we are quite as well provided for as any other delegation



at the conference.







In the afternoon our delegation met at the house of the American



minister and was duly organized. Although named by the President



first in the list of delegates, I preferred to leave the matter



of the chairmanship entirely to my associates, and they now



unanimously elected me as their President.







The instructions from the State Department were then read. These



were, in effect, as follows:







The first article of the Russian proposals, relating to the



non-augmentation of land and sea forces, is so inapplicable to



the United States at present that it is deemed advisable to leave



the initiative, upon this subject, to the representatives of



those powers to which it may properly apply.







As regards the articles relating to the non-employment of new



firearms, explosives, and other destructive agencies, the



restricted use of the existing instruments of destruction, and



the prohibition of certain contrivances employed in naval



warfare, it seems to the department that they are lacking in



practicability and that the discussion of these articles would



probably provoke divergency rather than unanimity of view. The



secretary goes on to say that "it is doubtful if wars will be



diminished by rendering them less destructive, for it is the



plain lesson of history that the periods of peace have been



longer protracted as the cost and destructiveness of war have



increased. The expediency of restraining the inventive genius of



our people in the direction of devising means of defense is by no



means clear, and, considering the temptations to which men and



nations may be exposed in a time of conflict, it is doubtful if



an international agreement of this nature would prove effective."







As to the fifth, sixth, and seventh articles, aiming, in the



interest of humanity, to succor those who by the chance of battle



have been rendered helpless, to alleviate their sufferings, and



to insure the safety of those whose mission is purely one of



peace and beneficence, we are instructed that any practicable



proposals should receive our earnest support.







On the eighth article, which proposes the wider extension of



"good offices, mediation, and arbitration," the secretary dwells



with much force, and finally says: "The proposal of the



conference promises to offer an opportunity thus far unequaled in



the history of the world for initiating a series of negotiations



that may lead to important practical results." The delegation is



therefore enjoined to propose, at an opportune moment, a plan for



an International Tribunal of Arbitration which is annexed to the



instructions, and to use their influence in the conference to



procure the adoption of its substance.







And, finally, we are instructed to propose to the conference the



principle of extending to strictly private property at sea the



immunity from destruction or capture by belligerent powers



analogous to that which such property already enjoys on land, and



to endeavor to have this principle incorporated in the permanent



law of civilized nations. A well-drawn historical resume of the



relations of the United States to the question of arbitration



thus far is added, and a historical summary of the action of the



United States, hitherto, regarding the exemption of private



property at sea from seizure during war.







The document of most immediate importance is the plan furnished



us for international arbitration. Its main features are as



follows:







First, a tribunal "composed of judges chosen, on account of their



personal integrity and learning in international law, by a



majority of the members of the highest court now existing in each



of the adhering states, one from each sovereign state



participating in the treaty, who shall hold office until their



successors are appointed by the same body."







Secondly, the tribunal to meet for organization not later than





six months after the treaty shall have been ratified by nine



powers; to organize itself as a permanent court, with such



officers as may be found necessary, and to fix its own place of



session and rules of procedure.







The third article provides that "the contracting nations will



mutually agree to submit to the international tribunal all



questions of disagreement between them, excepting such as may



relate to or involve their political independence or territorial



integrity."







The fifth article runs as follows: "A bench of judges for each



particular case shall consist of not fewer than three nor more



than seven, as may be deemed expedient, appointed by the



unanimous consent of the tribunal, and shall not include any



member who is either a native, subject, or citizen of the state



whose interests are in litigation in the case."







The sixth article provides that the general expenses of the



tribunal be divided equally among the adherent powers; but that



those arising from each particular case be provided for as may be



directed by the tribunal; also that non-adherent states may bring



their cases before it, on condition of the mutual agreement that



the state against which judgment shall be found shall pay, in



addition to the judgment, the expenses of the adjudication.







The seventh article makes provision for an appeal, within three



months after the notification of the decision, upon presentation



of evidence that the judgment contains a substantial error of



fact or law.







The eighth and final article provides that the treaty shall



become operative when nine sovereign states, whereof at least six



shall have taken part in the conference of The Hague, shall have



ratified its provisions.







It turns out that ours is the only delegation which has anything



like a full and carefully adjusted plan for a court of



arbitration. The English delegation, though evidently exceedingly



desirous that a system of arbitration be adopted, has come



without anything definitely drawn. The Russians have a scheme;



but, so far as can be learned, there is no provision in it for a



permanent court.







In the evening there was a general assemblage of the members of



the conference at a reception given by Jonkheer van Karnebeek,



formerly Dutch minister of foreign affairs, and now first



delegate from the Netherlands to the conference. It was very



brilliant, and I made many interesting acquaintances; but,



probably, since the world began, never has so large a body come



together in a spirit of more hopeless skepticism as to any good



result. Though no one gives loud utterance to this feeling, it is



none the less deep. Of course, among all these delegates



acquainted with public men and measures in Europe, there is



considerable distrust of the intentions of Russia; and,



naturally, the weakness of the Russian Emperor is well



understood, though all are reticent regarding it. The only open



utterances are those attributed to one or two of the older



European diplomatists, who lament being sent on an errand which



they fear is to be fruitless. One of these is said to have



bewailed this mission as a sad ending to his public services, and



to have declared that as he had led a long life of devotion to



his country and to its sovereign, his family might well look upon



his career as honorable; but that now he is probably doomed to



crown it with an open failure.







May 18.







At two o'clock in the afternoon the conference held its open



session at the "House in the Wood." The building is most



interesting, presenting as it does the art and general ideas of



two hundred and fifty years ago; it is full of historical



associations, and the groves and gardens about it are delightful.



The walls and dome of the great central hall are covered with



immense paintings in the style of Rubens, mainly by his pupils;



and, of these, one over the front entrance represents Peace



descending from heaven, bearing various symbols and, apparently,



entering the hall. To this M. de Beaufort, our honorary



president, the Netherlands minister of foreign affairs, made a



graceful allusion in his opening speech, expressing the hope that



Peace, having entered the hall, would go forth bearing blessings



to the world. Another representation, which covers one immense



wall, is a glorification of various princes of Orange: it is in



full front of me, as I sit, the Peace fresco being visible at my



left, and a lovely view of the gardens, and of the water beyond,



through the windows at my right.







The "House in the Wood" was built early in the seventeenth



century by a princess of the house of Orange, the grandmother of



William III of England. The central hall under the dome, above



referred to, is now filled up with seats and desks, covered with



green cloth, very neat and practical, and mainly arranged like



those in an English college chapel. Good fortune has given me one



of the two best seats in the house; it being directly in front of



the secretaries, who are arranged in a semicircle just below the



desk of the president; at my left are the other members of our



delegation, and facing me, across the central aisle, is Count



Munster, at the head of the German delegation. This piece of good



luck comes from the fact that we are seated in the alphabetical



order of our countries, beginning with Allemagne, continuing with



Amerique, and so on down the alphabet.







The other large rooms on the main floor are exceedingly handsome,



with superb Japanese and Chinese hangings, wrought about the



middle of the last century to fit the spaces they occupy; on all



sides are the most perfect specimens of Japanese and Chinese



bronzes, ivory carvings, lacquer-work, and the like: these rooms



are given up to the committees into which the whole body is



divided. Up-stairs is a dining-hall in which the Dutch Government



serves, every working-day, a most bounteous lunch to us all, and



at this there is much opportunity for informal discussion. Near



the main hall is a sumptuous saloon, hung round with interesting



portraits, one of them being an admirable likeness of Motley the



historian, who was a great favorite of the late Queen, and



frequently her guest in this palace.







Our first session was very interesting; the speech by the



honorary president, M. de Beaufort, above referred to, was in



every way admirable, and that by the president, M. de Staal,



thoroughly good. The latter is the Russian ambassador to London;



I had already met him in St. Petersburg, and found him



interesting and agreeable. He is, no doubt, one of the foremost



diplomatists of this epoch; but he is evidently without much



knowledge of parliamentary procedure. Congratulatory telegrams



were received from the Emperor of Russia and the Queen of the



Netherlands and duly answered.











May 19.







At eleven in the morning, in one of the large rooms of the hotel,



the presidents of delegations met to decide on a plan of



organization and work; and, sitting among them, I first began to



have some hopes of a good result. Still, at the outset, the



prospect was much beclouded. Though a very considerable number of



the foremost statesmen in Europe were present, our deliberations



appeared, for a time, a hopeless chaos: the unfamiliarity of our



president, Baron de Staal, with parliamentary usages seemed



likely to become embarrassing; but sundry statesmen, more



experienced in such matters, began drawing together, and were



soon elaborating a scheme to be presented to the entire



conference. It divided all the subjects named in the Mouravieff



circular among three great committees, the most important being



that on "Arbitration." The choice of representatives on these



from our delegation was made, and an ex-officio membership of all



three falls to me.







In the course of the day I met and talked with various



interesting men, among them Count Nigra, formerly Cavour's



private secretary and ambassador at the court of Napoleon III,



where he accomplished so much for Italian unity; Sir Julian



Pauncefote, the British ambassador at Washington; and M.



Bernaert, president of the Belgian Chamber. In the evening, at a



reception given by the minister of foreign affairs, M. de



Beaufort, I made further acquaintances and had instructive



conversations.







In addition to the strict duties of the conference, there is, of



course, a mass of social business, with no end of visits, calls,



and special meetings, to say nothing of social functions, on a



large scale, at the houses of sundry ministers and officials; but



these, of course, have their practical uses.







The Dutch Government is showing itself princely in various ways,



making every provision for our comfort and enjoyment.







In general, I am considerably encouraged. The skeptical feeling



with which we came together seems now passing away; the recent



speech of the Emperor William at Wiesbaden has aroused new hopes



of a fairly good chance for arbitration, and it looks as if the



promise made me just before I left Berlin by Baron von Bulow,



that the German delegation should cooperate thoroughly with our



own, is to be redeemed. That delegation assures us that it is



instructed to stand by us as far as possible on all the principal



questions. It forms a really fine body, its head being Count



Munster, whom I have already found very agreeable at Berlin and



Paris, and its main authority in the law of nations being



Professor Zorn, of the University of Konigsberg; but, curiously



enough, as if by a whim, the next man on its list is Professor



Baron von Stengel of Munich, who has written a book AGAINST



arbitration; and next to him comes Colonel Schwartzhoff, said to



be a man of remarkable ability in military matters, but strongly



prejudiced against the Russian proposals.







As to arbitration, we cannot make it compulsory, as so many very



good people wish; it is clear that no power here would agree to



that; but even to provide regular machinery for arbitration,



constantly in the sight of all nations, and always ready for use,



would be a great gain.







As to disarmament, it is clear that nothing effective can be done



at present. The Geneva rules for the better care of the wounded



on land will certainly be improved and extended to warfare on



sea, and the laws of war will doubtless be improved and given



stronger sanction.







Whether we can get our proposals as to private property on the



high seas before the conference is uncertain; but I think we can.



Our hopes are based upon the fact that they seem admissible under



one heading of the Mouravieff circular. There is, of course, a



determination on the part of leading members to exclude



rigorously everything not provided for in the original programme,



and this is only right; for, otherwise, we might spend years in



fruitless discussion. The Armenians, for example, are pressing us



to make a strong declaration in their behalf. Poland is also here



with proposals even more inflammatory; so are the Finlanders; and



so are the South African Boers. Their proposals, if admitted,



would simply be bombshells sure to blow all the leading nations



of Europe out of the conference and bring everything to naught.



Already pessimists outside are prophesying that on account of



these questions we are doomed to utter failure.







The peace people of all nations, including our own, are here in



great force. I have accepted an invitation from one of them to



lunch with a party of like mind, including Baroness von Suttner,



who has written a brilliant book, "Die Waffen Nieder," of which



the moral is that all nations shall immediately throw down their



arms. Mr. Stead is also here, vigorous as usual, full of curious



information, and abounding in suggestions.







There was a report, on our arriving, that the Triple Alliance



representatives are instructed to do everything to bring the



conference into discredit, but this is now denied. It is said



that their programme is changed, and things look like it. On the



whole, though no one is sanguine, there is more hope.











May 21.







In the morning went with Dr. Holls to a Whitsunday service at the



great old church here. There was a crowd, impressive chorals, and



a sermon at least an hour long. At our request, we were given



admirable places in the organ-loft, and sat at the side of the



organist as he managed that noble instrument. It was sublime.



After the closing voluntary Holls played remarkably well







To me the most striking feature in the service was a very earnest



prayer made by the clergyman for the conference. During the



afternoon we also visited the old prison near the Vijver, where



the De Witts and other eminent prisoners of state were confined,



and in front of which the former were torn in pieces by the mob.



Sadly interesting was a collection of instruments of torture,



which had the effect of making me better satisfied with our own



times than I sometimes am.







In the evening, with our minister, Mr. Newel, and the Dean of



Ely, his guest, to an exceedingly pleasant "tea" at the house of



Baroness Gravensteen, and met a number of interesting people,



among them a kindly old gentleman who began diplomatic life as a



British attache at Washington in the days of Webster and Clay,



and gave me interesting accounts of them.







The queer letters and crankish proposals which come in every day



are amazing. I have just added to my collection of diplomatic



curiosities a letter from the editor of a Democratic paper in



southern Illinois, addressed to me as ambassador at Mayence,



which he evidently takes to be the capital of Germany, asking me



to look after a great party of Western newspaper men who are to



go up the Rhine this summer and make a brief stay in the



above-named capital of the empire. I also receive very many



letters of introduction, which of course make large demands upon



my time. The number of epistles, also, which come in from public



meetings in large and small American towns is very great, some



evidently representing no persons other than the writers. As I



write the above, I open mechanically a letter from a peace



meeting assembled in Ledyard, Connecticut, composed of "Rogerine



Quakers"; but what a "Rogerine Quaker" is I know not. Some of



these letters are touching, and some have a comic side. A very



good one comes from May Wright Sewall; would that all the others



were as thoughtful!







It goes without saying that the Quakers are out in full force. We



have been answering by cable some of the most important



communications sent us from America; the others we shall try to



acknowledge by mail, though they are so numerous that I begin to



despair of this. If these good people only knew how all this



distracts us from the work which we have at heart as much as



they, we should get considerably more time to think upon the



problems before us.











May 22.







In the afternoon came M. de Bloch, the great publicist, who has



written four enormous volumes on war in modern times, summaries



of which, in the newspapers, are said to have converted the young



Emperor Nicholas to peace ideas, and to have been the real cause



of his calling the conference together. I found him interesting,



full of ideas, and devoted most earnestly to a theory that



militarism is gradually impoverishing all modern states, and that



the next European war will pauperize most of them.







Just afterward Count Welsersheimb, president of the Austrian



delegation, called, and was very anxious to know the line we are



to take. I told him frankly that we are instructed to present a



plan of arbitration, and to urge a resolution in favor of



exempting private property, not contraband of war, from seizure



on the high seas; that we are ready to go to the full length in



improving the laws of war, and in extending the Geneva rules to



maritime warfare; but that we look on the question of reducing



armaments as relating wholly to Europe, no part of it being



applicable to the United States.







As he seemed strongly in favor of our contention regarding



private property on the high seas, but fearful that Russia and



England, under a strict construction of the rules, would not



permit the subject to be introduced, I pointed out to him certain



clauses in the Mouravieff circular which showed that it was



entirely admissible.











May 23.







In the morning came a meeting of the American delegation on the



subject of telegraphing Washington for further instructions. We



find that some of the details in our present instructions are



likely to wreck our proposals, and there is a fear among us that,



by following too closely the plan laid down for us at Washington,



we may run full in the face of the Monroe Doctrine. It is indeed,



a question whether our people will be willing to have matters of



difference between South American States, or between the United



States and a South American State, or between European and South



American States, submitted to an arbitration in which a majority



of the judges are subjects of European powers. Various drafts of



a telegram were made, but the whole matter went over.







At ten the heads of delegations met and considered a plan of



organizing the various committees, and the list was read. Each of



the three great committees to which the subjects mentioned in the



Mouravieff circular are assigned was given a president,



vice-president, and two honorary presidents. The first of these



committees is to take charge of the preliminary discussion of



those articles in the Mouravieff circular concerning the



non-augmentation of armies and the limitation in the use of new



explosives and of especially destructive weapons. The second



committee has for its subject the discussion of humanitarian



reforms--namely, the adaptation of the stipulations of the



Convention of Geneva of 1864 to maritime warfare, the



neutralization of vessels charged with saving the wounded during



maritime combats, and the revision of the declaration concerning



customs of war elaborated in 1874 by the Conference of Brussels,



which has never yet been ratified. The third committee has charge



of the subject of arbitration, mediation, and the like.







The president of the first committee is M. Bernaert, a leading



statesman of Belgium, who has made a most excellent impression on



me from the first; and the two honorary presidents are Count



Munster, German ambassador at Paris, and myself.







The president of the second committee is M. de Martens, the



eminent Russian authority on international law; and the two



honorary presidents, Count Welsersheimb of Austria-Hungary, and



the Duke of Tetuan from Spain.







The third committee receives as its president M. Leon Bourgeois,



who has held various eminent positions in France; the honorary



presidents being Count Nigra, the Italian ambassador at Vienna,



and Sir Julian Pauncefote, the British ambassador at Washington.







There was much discussion and considerable difference of opinion



on many points, but the main breeze sprang up regarding the



publicity of our doings. An admirable speech was made by Baron de



Bildt, who is a son of my former Swedish colleague at Berlin, has



held various important positions at Washington and elsewhere, has



written an admirable history of Queen Christina of Sweden, and is



now minister plenipotentiary at Rome. He spoke earnestly in favor



of considerable latitude in communications to the press from the



authorities of the conference; but the prevailing opinion,



especially of the older men, even of those from constitutional



states, seemed to second the idea of Russia,--that communications



to the press should be reduced to a minimum, comprising merely



the external affairs of the conference. I am persuaded that this



view will get us into trouble; but it cannot be helped at



present.











May 24.







As was to be expected, there has begun some reaction from the



hopes indulged shortly after the conference came together. At our



arrival there was general skepticism; shortly afterward, and



especially when the organization of the arbitration committee was



seen to be so good, there came a great growth of hope; now comes



the usual falling back of many. But I trust that this will not be



permanent. Yesterday there was some talk which, though quiet, was



none the less bitter, to the effect that the purpose of Russia in



calling the conference is only to secure time for strengthening



her armaments; that she was never increasing her forces at a



greater rate, especially in the southwestern part of the empire



and in the Caucasus, and never intriguing more vigorously in all



directions. To one who stated this to me my answer simply was



that bad faith to this extent on the part of Russia is most



unlikely, if not impossible; that it would hand down the Emperor



and his advisers to the eternal execration and contempt of



mankind; and that, in any case, our duty is clear: to go on and



do the best we can; to perfect plans for a permanent tribunal of



arbitration; and to take measures for diminishing cruelty and



suffering in war.







Meeting Count Munster, who, after M. de Staal, is very generally



considered the most important personage here, we discussed the



subject of arbitration. To my great regret, I found him entirely



opposed to it, or, at least, entirely opposed to any



well-developed plan. He did not say that he would oppose a



moderate plan for voluntary arbitration, but he insisted that



arbitration must be injurious to Germany; that Germany is



prepared for war as no other country is or can be; that she can



mobilize her army in ten days; and that neither France, Russia,



nor any other power can do this. Arbitration, he said, would



simply give rival powers time to put themselves in readiness, and



would therefore be a great disadvantage to Germany.







Later came another disappointment. M. de Martens, having read the



memorandum which I left with him yesterday on the subject of



exempting private property, not contraband of war, from seizure



upon the high seas called, and insisted that it would be



impossible, under any just construction of the Mouravieff



programme, to bring the subject before the second committee as we



had hoped to do; that Russia would feel obliged to oppose its



introduction; and that Great Britain, France, and Italy, to say



nothing of other powers, would do the same. This was rather



trying, for I had especially desired to press this long-desired



improvement in international law; and I showed him how persistent



the United States had been as regards this subject throughout our



whole history, how earnest the President and his cabinet are in



pressing it now, and how our delegation are bound, under our



instructions, to bring it before the conference. I insisted that



we should at least have the opportunity to present it, even if it



were afterward declared out of order. To this he demurred, saying



that he feared it would arouse unpleasant debate. I then



suggested that the paper be publicly submitted to our whole body



for special reference to a future conference, and this he took



into consideration. Under other circumstances, I would have made



a struggle in the committee and, indeed, in the open session of



the full conference; but it is clear that what we are sent here



for is, above all, to devise some scheme of arbitration, and that



anything which comes in the way of this, by provoking ill-feeling



or prolonging discussion on other points, will diminish our



chances of obtaining what the whole world so earnestly desires.







During the day our American delegation held two sessions; and, as



a result, a telegram of considerable length to the State



Department was elaborated, asking permission to substitute a new



section in our original instructions regarding an arbitration



tribunal, and to be allowed liberty to make changes in minor



points, as the development of opinion in the conference may



demand. The substitute which we suggested referred especially to



the clash between the original instructions and the Monroe



Doctrine. I was very reluctant to send the despatch; but, on the



whole, it seemed best, and it was adopted unanimously.







In the afternoon, at five, the presidents of all the delegations



went to the palace, by appointment, and were presented to the



young Queen and to the Queen-mother. The former is exceedingly



modest, pretty, and pleasant; and as she came into the room,



about which were ranged that line of solemn, elderly men, it



seemed almost pathetic. She was evidently timid, and it was, at



first, hard work for her; but she got along well with Count



Munster, and when she came to me I soon brought the conversation



upon the subject of the "House in the Wood" by thanking her for



the pains her government had taken in providing so beautiful a



place for us. This new topic seemed to please her, and we had



quite a long talk upon it; she speaking of her visits to the



park, for skating and the like, and I dwelling on the beauty of



the works of art and the views in the park. Then the delegates,



going to the apartments of the Queen-mother, went through a



similar formality with her. She is very stout, but fine-looking,



with a kindly face and manner. Both mother and daughter spoke,



with perfect ease, Dutch, French, German English, and how many



other languages I know not. The young Queen was very simply



dressed, like any other young lady of seventeen, except that she



had a triple row of large pearls about her neck. In the evening,



at 9.30, the entire delegations were received at a great



presentation and ball. The music was very fine, but the most



interesting thing to me was the fact that, as the palace was



built under Louis Bonaparte and Hortense, the main rooms were in



the most thoroughgoing style Empire, not only in their



decorations, but in their furniture and accessories,--clocks,



vases, candelabra, and the like. I have never seen that style,



formerly so despised, but now so fashionable, developed as fully.







After the presentation I met Sir John Fisher, one of the English



delegates, an admiral in the British navy, and found him very



intelligent. He said that he was thoroughly for peace, and had



every reason to be so, since he knew something of the horrors of



war. It appears that in one of the recent struggles in China he



went ashore with eleven hundred men and returned with only about



five hundred; but, to my regret, I found him using the same



argument as regards the sea that Count Munster had made regarding



the land. He said that the navy of Great Britain was and would



remain in a state of complete preparation for war; that a vast



deal depended on prompt action by the navy; and that the truce



afforded by arbitration proceedings would give other powers time,



which they would otherwise not have, to put themselves into



complete readiness. He seemed uncertain whether it was best for



Great Britain, under these circumstances, to support a



thoroughgoing plan of arbitration; but, on the whole, seemed



inclined to try it to some extent. Clearly what Great Britain



wants is a permanent system of arbitration with the United



States; but she does not care much, I think, for such a provision



as regards other powers.







There is considerable curiosity among leading members to know



what the United States really intends to do; and during the day



Sir Julian Pauncefote and others have called to talk over the



general subject.







The London "Times" gives quite correctly a conversation of mine,



of rather an optimistic nature, as to the possibilities and



probabilities of arbitration, and the improvement of the customs



of war; but in another quarter matters have not gone so well: the



"Corriere della Sera" of Milan publishes a circumstantial



interview with me, which has been copied extensively in the



European press, to the effect that I have declared my belief in



the adoption of compulsory arbitration and disarmament. This is a



grotesque misstatement. I have never dreamed of saying anything



of the kind; in fact, have constantly said the contrary; and,



what is more, I have never been interviewed by the correspondent



of that or of any other Continental paper.















CHAPTER XLVI







AS PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN DELEGATION AT THE PEACE CONFERENCE



OF THE HAGUE--II







May 25. This morning a leading delegate of one of the great



European powers called and gave me a very interesting account of



the situation as he sees it.







He stated that the Russian representatives, on arriving here,



gave out that they were not prepared with any plan for a definite



tribunal of arbitration; but that shortly afterward there



appeared some discrepancy on this point between the statements of



the various members of their delegation; and that they now



propose a system of arbitration, mediation, and examination into



any cause of difficulty between nations.







In the evening our secretary spoke of the matter to M. de Staal,



the president of the Russian delegation and of the conference,



and was told that this plan would, within a day or two, be



printed and laid before the whole body.







This is a favorable sign. More and more it looks as if the great



majority of us are beginning to see the necessity of some scheme



of arbitration embracing a court and definite, well-contrived



accessories.







The above-mentioned discrepancy between various statements of the



Russians leads me to think that what Count Munster told me some



days since may have some truth in it--namely, that



Pobedonostzeff, whom I knew well, when minister to Russia, as the



strongest man of moral, religious, and social questions in that



country, is really the author of the documents that were



originally given to the world as emanating from the Russian



Foreign Office, and that he has now added to them this definite



scheme for arbitration. Remembering our old conversations, in



which he dwelt upon the great need of money in order to increase



the stipends of the Russian clergy, and so improve their moral as



well as religious condition, I can understand easily that he may



have greatly at heart a plan which would save a portion of the



enormous expenditure of Russia on war, and enable him to do more



for the improvement of the church.







Dined at the British legation with the minister, my old friend of



St. Petersburg days, Sir Henry Howard, De Martens, the real head



of the Russian delegation, being of the party, and had a long



talk with the latter about Russia and Russians. He told me that



Pobedonostzeff is now becoming old and infirm, and it appears



that there has been a sort of cleaning out of the Foreign Office



and the Ministry of the Interior--a procedure which was certainly



needed in my time.







Later in the evening we went to a reception by Baron van



Hardenbroek, the grand chamberlain, where I met various



interesting persons, especially M. Descamps, the eminent Belgian



delegate, who, in the fervor of his speech yesterday morning,



upset his inkstand and lavished its contents on his neighbors. He



is a devotee of arbitration, and is preparing a summary for the



committee intrusted with that subject. There seemed to be, in



discussing the matter with various delegates at this reception, a



general feeling of encouragement.







During the day Mr. Loeher, a Berlin sculptor, called, and carried



me off to see his plan of a great statue of "Peace" which he



hopes to induce the Emperor Nicholas to erect in Paris. It seems



to me well conceived, all except the main figure, which I could



not induce myself to like. In the anxiety of the sculptor to



avoid any more female figures, and to embody virile aspirations



for peace, he has placed this main figure at the summit of the



monument in something like a long pea-jacket, with an



insufficient mantle at the back, and a crown upon its head.







The number of people with plans, schemes, notions, nostrums,



whimsies of all sorts, who press upon us and try to take our



time, is enormous; and when to this is added the pest of



interviewers and photographers, life becomes serious indeed.











May 26.







At two the committee on arbitration met, and, as it is the



largest of all, its session was held in the main hall under the



dome. The Russian plan was presented, and was found to embrace



three distinct features:







First, elements of a plan of mediation; secondly, a plan for



international arbitration; thirdly, a plan for the international



examination of questions arising between powers, such examination



being conducted by persons chosen by each of the contestants.



This last is a new feature and is known as a commission



internationale d'enquete.







The project for a plan of arbitration submits a number of minor



matters to compulsory arbitration, but the main mass of



differences to voluntary arbitration.







But there was no definite proposal for a tribunal, and there was



an evident feeling of disappointment, which was presently voiced



by Sir Julian Pauncefote, who, in the sort of plain, dogged way



of a man who does not purpose to lose what he came for, presented



a resolution looking definitely to the establishment, here and



now, of an international tribunal of arbitration. After some



discussion, the whole was referred to a subcommittee, to put this



and any other proposals submitted into shape for discussion by



the main committee. In the course of the morning the American



delegation received an answer to its telegram to the State



Department, which was all that could be desired, since it left us



virtually free to take the course which circumstances might



authorize, in view of the main object to be attained. But it came



too late to enable us to elaborate a plan for the meeting above



referred to, and I obtained permission from the president, M.



Leon Bourgeois, to defer the presentation of our scheme until



about the middle of next week.







Just before the session of the main committee, at which the



Russian plan was received, I had a long and very interesting talk



with Mr. van Karnebeek, one of the leading statesmen of the



Netherlands, a former minister of foreign affairs, and the



present chief of the Dutch delegation in the conference. He seems



clear-headed and farsighted, and his belief is that the



conference will really do something of value for arbitration. He



says that men who arrived here apparently indifferent have now



become interested, and that amour propre, if nothing else, will



lead them to elaborate something likely to be useful. He went at



considerable length into the value of an international tribunal,



even if it does nothing more than keep nations mindful of the



fact that there is some way, other than war, of settling



disputes.







A delegate also informed me that in talking with M. de Staal the



latter declared that in his opinion the present conference is



only the first of a series, and that it is quite likely that



another will be held next winter or next spring.







In the evening I made the acquaintance of Mr. Marshall, a



newspaper correspondent, who is here preparing some magazine



articles on The Hague and the conference. He is a very



interesting man on various accounts, and especially at present,



since he has but just returned from the Cuban campaign, where he



was fearfully wounded, receiving two shots which carried away



parts of the vertebral column, a bullet being left in his body.



He seems very cheerful, though obliged to get about on crutches.











May 27.







In the morning, calls from various people urging all kinds of



schemes for arbitration and various other good things for the



human race, including considerable advantages, in many cases, for



themselves.







Best of all, by far, was John Bellows of Gloucester, our old



Quaker friend at St. Petersburg, whom I was exceedingly glad to



take by the hand: he, at least, is a thoroughly good



man--sincere, honest, earnest, and blessed with good sense.







The number of documents, printed and written, coming in upon us



is still enormous. Many are virtually sermons displaying the



evils of war, the blessings of peace, and the necessity of



falling back upon the Bible. Considering the fact that our



earlier sacred books indicate approval by the Almighty of some of



the most bloodthirsty peoples and most cruel wars ever known,



such a recommendation seems lacking in "actuality."







This morning we had another visit from Sir Julian Pauncefote,



president of the British delegation, and discussed with him an



amalgamation of the Russian, British, and American proposals for



an arbitration tribunal. He finds himself, as we all do,



agreeably surprised by the Russian document, which, inadequate as



it is, shows ability in devising a permanent scheme both for



mediation and arbitration.







During the day President Low, who had been asked by our



delegation to bring the various proposals agreed to by us into



definite shape, made his report; it was thoroughly well done,



and, with some slight changes, was adopted as the basis for our



final project of an arbitration scheme. We are all to meet on



Monday, the 29th, for a study of it.







In the evening to the concert given to the conference by the



burgomaster and city council. It was very fine, and the audience



was large and brilliant. There was music by Tschaikovsky, Grieg,



and Wagner, some of which was good, but most of it seemed to me



noisy and tending nowhither; happily, in the midst of it came two



noble pieces, one by Beethoven and the other by Mozart, which



gave a delightful relief.







May 28.







Drove with Dr. Holls to Delft, five miles, and attended service



at the "New Church." The building was noble, but the service



seemed very crude and dismal, nearly the whole of it consisting



of two long sermons separated by hymns, and all unspeakably



dreary.







Afterward we saw the tombs of William of Orange and Grotius, and



they stirred many thoughts. I visited them first nearly forty



years ago, with three persons very dear to me, all of whom are



now passed away. More than ever it is clear to me that of all



books ever written--not claiming divine inspiration--the great



work of Grotius on "War and Peace" has been of most benefit to



mankind. Our work here, at the end of the nineteenth century, is



the direct result of his, at the beginning of the seventeenth.







Afterward to the Prinzenhof, visiting the place where William of



Orange was assassinated. Was glad to see the new statue of



Grotius in front of the church where he lies buried.







May 29.







In the morning President Low and myself walked, and talked over



various proposals for arbitration, especially our own. It looks



much as if we can amalgamate the Russian, British, and original



American plans into a good arrangement for a tribunal. We also



discussed a scheme for the selection, by disagreeing nations, of



"seconding powers," who, before the beginning of hostilities, or



even after, shall attempt to settle difficulties between powers,



or, if unsuccessful, to stop them as soon after war begins as the



honor of the nations concerned may allow. The Germans greatly



favor this plan, since it resembles their tribunal of honor



(Ehrengericht); it was originally suggested to us by our



secretary, Dr. Holls.







In the evening, at six, the American delegation met. We had



before us type-written copies of our whole arbitration project as



elaborated in our previous sessions, and sundry changes having



been made, most of them verbal, the whole, after considerable



discussion, was adopted.







At ten I left, via Hook of Holland and Harwich, for London,



arriving about ten the next morning, and attending to various



matters of business. It was fortunate for me that I could have



for this purpose an almost complete lull in our proceedings, the



first and second committees of the conference being at work on



technical matters, and the third not meeting until next Monday.







In the evening I went to the Lyceum Theatre, saw Henry Irving and



Ellen Terry in Sardou's "Robespierre," and for the first time in





my life was woefully disappointed in them. The play is wretchedly



conceived, and it amazes me that Sardou, who wrote "Thermidor,"



which is as admirable as "Robespierre" is miserable could ever



have attached his name to such a piece.







For the wretchedness of its form there is, no doubt, some excuse



in the fact that it has been done into English, and doubtless



cut, pieced, and altered to suit the Lyceum audiences; but when



one compares the conspiracy part of it with a properly conceived



drama in which a conspiracy is developed, like Schiller's



"Fiesco," the difference is enormously in favor of the latter. As



literature the play in its English dress is below contempt.







As to its historical contents, Sardou resorts to an expedient



which, although quite French in its character, brings the whole



thing down to a lower level than anything in which I had ever



seen Irving before. The center of interest is a young royalist



who, having been present with his mother and sister at the



roll-call of the condemned and the harrowing scenes resulting



therefrom, rushes forth, determined to assassinate Robespierre,



but is discovered by the latter to be his long-lost illegitimate



son, and then occur a series of mystifications suited only to the



lowest boulevard melodrama.







As to the action of the piece, the only thing that showed



Irving's great ability was the scene in the forest of



Montmorency, where, as Robespierre, he reveals at one moment, in



his talk with the English envoy, his ambition, his overestimate



of himself, his suspicion of everybody and everything, his



willingness to be cruel to any extent in order to baffle possible



enemies; and then, next moment, on the arrival of his young



friends, boys and girls, the sentimental, Rousseau side of his



character. This transition was very striking. The changes in the



expression of Irving's face were marvelous--as wonderful as those



in his Louis XI; but that was very nearly all. In everything



else, Coquelin, as I had seen him in Sardou's "Thermidor," was



infinitely better.







Besides this, the piece was, in general, grotesquely



unhistorical. It exhibits Robespierre's colleagues in the



Committee of Public Safety as noisy and dirty street blackguards.



Now, bad as they were, they were not at all of that species, nor



did their deliberations take place in the manner depicted.



Billaud-Varennes is represented as a drunken vagabond sitting on



a table at the committee and declaiming. He was not this at all,



nor was Tallien, vile as he was, anything like the blackguard



shown in this piece.







The final scene, in which Robespierre is brought under accusation



by the Convention, was vastly inferior to the same thing in



"Thermidor"; and, what was worse, instead of paraphrasing or



translating the speeches of Billaud-Varennes, Tallien, and



Robespierre, which he might have found in the "Moniteur," Sardou,



or rather Irving, makes the leading characters yell harangues



very much of the sort which would be made in a meeting of drunken



dock laborers to-day. Irving's part in this was not at all well



done. The unhistorical details now came thick and fast, among



them his putting his head down on the table of the tribune as a



sign of exhaustion, and then, at the close, shooting himself in



front of the tribunal. If he did shoot himself, which is



doubtful, it was neither at that time nor in that place.







But, worst of all, the character of Robespierre was made far too



melodramatic, and was utterly unworthy of Irving, whom, in all



his other pieces, I have vastly admired. He completely



misconceives his hero. Instead of representing him as, from first



to last, a shallow Rousseau sentimentalist, with the proper



mixture of vanity, suspicion, and cruelty, he puts into him a



great deal too much of the ruffian, which was not at all in



Robespierre's character.







The most striking scene in the whole was the roll-call at the



prison. This was perhaps better than that in Sardou's



"Thermidor," and the tableaux were decidedly better.







The scene at the "Festival of the Supreme Being" was also very



striking, and in many respects historical; but, unless I am



greatly mistaken, the performance referred to did not take place



as represented, but in the garden directly in front of the



Tuileries. The family scene at the house of Duplay the carpenter



was exceedingly well managed; old Duplay, smoking his pipe,



listening to his daughters playing on a spinet and singing



sentimental songs of the Rousseau period, was perfect. The old



carpenter and his family evidently felt that the golden age had



at last arrived; that humanity was at the end of its troubles;



and that the world was indebted for it all to their lodger



Robespierre, who sat in the midst of them reading, writing, and



enjoying the coddling and applause lavished upon him. And he and



they were to go to the guillotine within a week!







Incidentally there came a little touch worthy of Sardou; for, as



Robespierre reads his letters, he finds one from his brother, in



which he speaks of a young soldier and revolutionist of ability



whose acquaintance he has just made, whom he very much likes, and



whose republicanism he thoroughly indorses--one Buonaparte. This



might have occurred, and very likely did occur, very much as



shown on the stage; for one of the charges which nearly cost



Bonaparte his life on the Ninth Thermidor was that he was on



friendly terms with the younger Robespierre, who was executed



with his more famous brother.







On the whole, the play was very disappointing. It would certainly



have been hissed at the Porte St. Martin, and probably at any



other Paris theater.







June 1.







Having left London last evening, I arrived at The Hague early



this morning and found, to my great satisfaction, that the



subcommittee of the third committee had unanimously adopted the



American plan of "seconding powers," and that our whole general



plan of arbitration will be to-day in print and translated into



French for presentation. I also find that Sir Julian Pauncefote's



arbitration project has admirable points.







The first article in Sir Julian's proposal states that, with the



desire to facilitate immediate recourse to arbitration by nations



which may fail to adjust by diplomatic negotiations differences



arising between them, the signatory powers agree to organize a



permanent tribunal of international arbitration, accessible at



all times, to be governed by a code, provided by this conference,



so far as applicable and consistent with any special stipulations



agreed to between the contesting parties.







Its second provision is the establishment of a permanent central



office, where the records of the tribunal shall be preserved and



its official business transacted, with a permanent secretary,



archivist, and suitable staff, who shall reside on the spot. This



office shall make arrangements for the assembling of the



tribunal, at the request of contesting parties.







Its third provision is that each of the signatory powers shall



transmit the names of two persons who shall be recognized in



their own country as jurists or publicists of high character and



fitness, and who shall be qualified to act as judges. These



persons shall be members of the tribunal, and a list of their



names shall be recorded in the central office. In case of death



or retirement of any one of these, the vacancy shall be filled up



by new appointment.







Its fourth provision is that any of the signatory powers desiring



to have recourse to the tribunal for the settlement of



differences shall make known such desire to the secretary of the



central office, who shall thereupon furnish the powers concerned



with a list of the members of the tribunal, from which such



powers may select such number of judges as they may think best.



The powers concerned may also, if they think fit, adjoin to these



judges any other person, although his name may not appear on the



list. The persons so selected shall constitute the tribunal for



the purpose of such arbitration, and shall assemble at such date



as may be most convenient for the litigants.







The tribunal shall ordinarily hold its sessions at ----; but it



shall have power to fix its place of session elsewhere, and to



change the same from time to time, as circumstances may suggest.







The fifth provision is that any power, even though not



represented in the present conference, may have recourse to the



tribunal on such terms as may be prescribed by the regulations.







Provision sixth: The government of ----is charged by the



signatory powers, on their behalf, as soon as possible after the



conclusion of this convention, to name a permanent council of



administration, at ----, composed of five members and a



secretary. This council shall organize and establish the central



office, which shall be under its control and direction. It shall



make such rules and regulations as may be necessary for the



office; it shall dispose of all questions that may arise in



relation to the working of the tribunal, or which may be referred



to it by the central office; it shall make all subordinate



appointments, may suspend or dismiss all employees, and shall fix



their salaries and control their expenditure. This council shall



select its president, who shall have a casting-vote. The



remuneration of the members shall be fixed from time to time by



accord between the signatory powers.







Provision seventh: The signatory powers agree to share among them



the expenses pertaining to the administration of the central



office and the council of administration; but the expenses



incident to every arbitration, including the remuneration of the



arbiters, shall be equally borne by the contesting powers.







From a theoretical point of view, I prefer to this our American



plan of a tribunal permanently in session: the judges, in every



particular case, to be selected from this. Thus would be provided



a court of any odd number between three and nine, as the



contesting powers may desire. But from the practical point of



view, even though the Russian plan of requiring the signatory



powers to send to the tribunal a multitude of smaller matters,



such as those connected with the postal service, etc., is carried



out, the great danger is that such a court, sitting constantly as



we propose, would, for some years, have very little to do, and



that soon we should have demagogues and feather-brained



"reformers" ridiculing them as "useless," "eating their heads



off," and "doing nothing"; that then demagogic appeals might lead



one nation after another to withdraw from an arrangement



involving large expense apparently useless; and in view of this



latter difficulty I am much inclined to think that we may, under



our amended instructions, agree to support, in its essential



features as above given, the British proposal, and, with some



reservations, the code proposed by the Russians.







Among the things named by the Russians as subjects which the



agreeing powers must submit to arbitration, are those relating to



river navigation and international canals; and this, in view of



our present difficulties in Alaska and in the matter of the



Isthmus Canal, we can hardly agree to. During the morning Sir



Julian came in and talked over our plan of arbitration as well as



his own and that submitted by Russia. He said that he had seen M.



de Staal, and that it was agreed between them that the latter



should send Sir Julian, at the first moment possible, an



amalgamation of the Russian and British plans, and this Sir



Julian promised that he would bring to us, giving us a chance to



insert any features from our own plan which, in our judgment,



might be important. He seemed much encouraged, as we all are.







Returning to our rooms, I found Count Munster. As usual, he was



very interesting; and, after discussing sundry features of the



Russian plan, he told one or two rather good stories. He said



that during his stay in St Petersburg as minister, early in the



reign of Alexander II, he had a very serious quarrel with Prince



Gortchakoff the minister of foreign affairs, who afterward became



the famous chancellor of the empire.







Count Munster had received one day from a professor at Gottingen



a letter stating that a young German savant, traveling for



scientific purposes in Russia, had been seized and treated as a



prisoner, without any proper cause whatever; that, while he was



engaged in his peaceful botanizing, a police officer, who was



taking a gang of criminals to Siberia, had come along, and one of



his prisoners having escaped, this officer, in order to avoid



censure, had seized the young savant, quietly clapped the number



of the missing man on his back, put him in with the gang of



prisoners, and carried him off along with the rest; so that he



was now held as a convict in Siberia. The count put the letter in



his pocket, thinking that he might have an opportunity to use it,



and a day or two afterward his chance came. Walking on the quay,



he met the Emperor (Alexander II), who greeted him heartily, and



said, "Let me walk with you." After walking and talking some



time, the count told the story of the young German, whereupon the



Emperor asked for proofs of its truth. At this Munster pulled the



letter out of his pocket; and, both having seated themselves on a



bench at the side of the walk, the Emperor read it. On finishing



it, the Emperor said: "Such a thing as this can happen only in



Russia." That very afternoon he sent a special police squad,



post-haste, all the way to Siberia, ordering them to find the



young German and bring him back to St. Petersburg.







Next day Count Munster called at the Foreign Office on current



business, when Gortchakoff came at him in a great rage, asking



him by what right he communicated directly with the Emperor; and



insisting that he had no business to give a letter directly to



the Emperor, that it ought to have gone through the Foreign



Office. Gortchakoff reproached the count bitterly for this



departure from elementary diplomatic etiquette. At this Munster



replied: "I gave the letter to the Emperor because he asked me



for it, and I did not give it to you because I knew perfectly



well that you would pigeonhole it and the Emperor would never



hear of it. I concede much in making any answer at all to your



talk, which seems to me of a sort not usual between gentlemen."



At this Gortchakoff was much milder, and finally almost



obsequious, becoming apparently one of Munster's devoted friends,



evidently thinking that, as Munster had gained the confidence of



the Emperor, he was a man to be cultivated.







The sequel to the story was also interesting. The policemen,



after their long journey to Siberia, found the young German and



brought him to St. Petersburg, where the Emperor received him



very cordially and gave him twenty thousand rubles as an



indemnity for the wrong done him. The young savant told Munster



that he had not been badly treated, that he had been assigned a



very pleasant little cottage, and had perfect freedom to pursue



his scientific researches.







On my talking with the count about certain Russian abuses, and



maintaining that Russia, at least in court circles, had improved



greatly under Alexander III as regarded corruption, he said that



he feared she was now going back, and he then repeated a remark



made by the old Grand Duke Michael, brother of Alexander II, who



said that if any Russian were intrusted with the official care of



a canary he would immediately set up and maintain a coach and



pair out of it.







At six o'clock our American delegation met and heard reports,



especially from Captain Mahan and Captain Crozier, with reference



to the doings in the subcommittees. Captain Mahan reported that



he had voted against forbidding asphyxiating bombs, etc.,



evidently with the idea that such a provision would prove to be



rather harmful than helpful to the cause of peace.







Captain Crozier reported that his subcommittee of committee No. 2



had, at its recent meeting, tried to take up the exemption of



private property from seizure on the high seas in time of war,



but had been declared out of order by the chairman, De Martens,



the leading Russian delegate, who seems determined to prevent the



subject coming before the conference. The question before our



American delegation now was, Shall we try to push this American



proposal before the subcommittee of the second committee, or



before the entire conference at a later period? and the general



opinion was in favor of the latter course. It was not thought



best to delay the arbitration plan by its introduction at



present.







In the evening dined with Minister Newel, and had a very



interesting talk with Van Karnebeek, who had already favorably



impressed me by his clear-headedness and straightforwardness;



also with Messrs. Asser, member of the Dutch Council of State,



and Rahusen, member of the Upper Chamber of the States General,



both of whom are influential delegates.







All three of these men spoke strongly in favor of our plan for



the exemption of private property on the high seas, Van Karnebeek



with especial earnestness. He said that, looking merely at the



material interests of the Netherlands, he might very well favor



the retention of the present system, since his country is little



likely to go into war, and is certain to profit by the carrying



trade in case of any conflict between the great powers; that, of



course, under such circumstances, a large amount of commerce



would come to Holland as a neutral power; but that it was a



question of right and of a proper development of international



law, and that he, as well as the two other gentlemen above named,



was very earnestly in favor of joint action by the powers who are



in favor of our proposal. He thought that the important thing



just now is to secure the cooperation of Germany, which seems to



be at the parting of the ways, and undecided which to take.







In the course of the evening one of my European colleagues, who



is especially familiar with the inner history of the calling of



the conference, told me that the reason why Professor Stengel was



made a delegate was not that he wrote the book in praise of war



and depreciating arbitration, which caused his appointment to be



so unfavorably commented upon, but because, as an eminent



professor of international law, he represented Bavaria; and that



as Bavaria, though represented at St. Petersburg, was not



invited, it was thought very essential that a well-known man from



that kingdom should be put into the general German delegation.







On my asking why Brazil, though represented at St. Petersburg,



was not invited, he answered that Brazil was invited, but showed



no desire to be represented. On my asking him if he supposed this



was because other South American powers were not invited, he said



that he thought not; that it was rather its own indifference and



carelessness, arising from the present unfortunate state of



government in that country. On my saying that the Emperor Dom



Pedro, in his time, would have taken the opportunity to send a



strong delegation, he said: "Yes, he certainly would have done



so; but the present government is a poor sort of thing."







I also had a talk with one of the most eminent publicists of the



Netherlands, on the questions dividing parties in this country,



telling him that I found it hard to understand the line of



cleavage between them. He answered that it is, in the main, a



line between religious conservatives and liberals; the



conservatives embracing the Roman Catholics and high orthodox



Protestants, and the liberals those of more advanced opinions. He



said that socialism plays no great part in Holland; that the



number of its representatives is very small compared with that in



many European states; that the questions on which parties divide



are mainly those in which clerical ideas are more or less



prominent; that the liberal party, if it keeps together, is much



the stronger party of the two, but that it suffers greatly from



its cliques and factions.







On returning home after dinner, I found a cipher despatch from



the Secretary of State informing us that President McKinley



thinks that our American commission ought not to urge any



proposal for "seconding powers"; that he fears lest it may block



the way of the arbitration proposals. This shows that imperfect



reports have reached the President and his cabinet. The fact is



that the proposal of "seconding powers" was warmly welcomed by



the subcommittee when it was presented; that the members very



generally telegraphed home to their governments, and at once



received orders to support it; that it was passed by a unanimous



vote of the subcommittee; and that its strongest advocates were



the men who are most in favor of an arbitration plan. So far from



injuring the prospects of arbitration, it has increased them; it



is very generally spoken of as a victory for our delegation, and



has increased respect for our country, and for anything we may



hereafter present.











June 2.







This morning we sent a cipher telegram to the Secretary of State,



embodying the facts above stated.







The shoals of telegrams, reports of proceedings of societies,



hortatory letters, crankish proposals, and peace pamphlets from



America continue. One of the telegrams which came late last night



was pathetic; it declared that three millions of Christian



Endeavorers bade us "Godspeed," etc., etc.







During the morning De Martens, Low, Holls, and myself had a very



thoroughgoing discussion of the Russian, British, and American



arbitration plans. We found the eminent Russian under very



curious misapprehensions regarding some minor points, one of them



being that he had mistaken the signification of our word



"publicist"; and we were especially surprised to find his use of



the French word "publiciste" so broad that it would include M.



Henri Rochefort, Mr. Stead, or any newspaper writer; and he was



quite as surprised to find that with us it would include only



such men as Grotius, Wheaton, Calvo, and himself.







After a long and intricate discussion we separated on very good



terms, having made, I think, decided progress toward fusing all



three arbitration plans into one which shall embody the merits of



all.







One difficulty we found, of which neither our State Department



nor ourselves had been fully aware. Our original plan required



that the judges for the arbitration tribunal should be nominated



by the highest courts of the respective nations; but De Martens



showed us that Russia has no highest court in our sense of the



word. Then, too, there is Austria-Hungary, which has two supreme



courts of equal authority. This clause, therefore, we arranged to



alter, though providing that the original might stand as regards



countries possessing supreme courts.







At lunch we had Baron de Bildt, Swedish minister at Rome and



chief of the Swedish delegation at the conference, and Baron de



Bille, Danish minister at London and chief delegate from Denmark.



De Bille declared himself averse to a permanent tribunal to be in



constant session, on the ground that, having so little to do, it



would be in danger of becoming an object of derision to the press



and peoples of the world.







We were all glad to find, upon the arrival of the London "Times,"



that our arbitration project seemed to be receiving extensive



approval, and various telegrams from America during the day



indicated the same thing.







It looks more and more as if we are to accomplish something. The



only thing in sight calculated to throw a cloud over the future



is the attitude of the German press against the whole business



here; the most virulent in its attacks being the high Lutheran



conservative--and religious!--journal in Berlin, the



"Kreuz-Zeitung." Still, it is pleasant to see that eminent



newspaper find, for a time, some other object of denunciation



than the United States.











June 3.







In the afternoon drove to Scheveningen and took tea with Count



Munster and his daughter. He was somewhat pessimistic, as usual,



but came out very strongly in favor of the American view as



regards exemption of private property on the high seas. Whether



this is really because Germany would derive profit from it, or



because she thinks this question a serviceable entering wedge



between the United States and Great Britain, there is no telling



at present. I am sorry to say that our hopes regarding it are to



be dashed, so far as the present conference is concerned. Sundry



newspaper letters and articles in the "Times" show clearly that



the English Government is strongly opposed to dealing with it



here and now; and as France and Russia take the same position,



there is no hope for any action, save such as we can take to keep



the subject alive and to secure attention to it by some future



conference.















CHAPTER XLVII







AS PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN DELEGATION AT THE PEACE CONFERENCE



OF THE HAGUE: III--1899







June 4.







We have just had an experience which "adds to the gaiety of



nations." Some days since, representatives of what is called "the



Young Turkish party" appeared and asked to be heard. They



received, generally, the cold shoulder, mainly because the



internal condition of Turkey is not one of the things which the



conference was asked to discuss; but also because there is a



suspicion that these "Young Turks" are enabled to live in luxury



at Paris by blackmailing the Sultan, and that their zeal for



reform becomes fervid whenever their funds run low, and cools



whenever a remittance comes from the Bosphorus. But at last some



of us decided to give them a hearing, informally; the main object



being to get rid of them. At the time appointed, the delegation



appeared in evening dress, and, having been ushered into the



room, the spokesman began as follows, very impressively:







"Your Excellencies, ve are ze Young Turkeys."







This was too much for most of us, and I think that, during our



whole stay at The Hague thus far, we have never undertaken



anything more difficult, physically, than to keep our faces



straight during the harangue which followed.







Later, we went with nearly all the other members of the



conference to Haarlem, in a special train, by invitation of the



burgomaster and town council, to the "Fete Hippique" and the



"Fete des Fleurs." We were treated very well indeed, refreshments



being served on the grand stand during the performances, which



consisted of hurdle races, etc., for which I cared nothing,



followed by a procession of peasants in old chaises of various



periods, and in the costumes of the various provinces of the



Netherlands, which interested me much. The whole closed with a



long train of fine equipages superbly decorated with flowers.







Discussing the question of the immunity of private property, not



contraband of war, on the high seas, I find that the main



argument which our opponents are now using is that, even if the



principle were conceded, new and troublesome questions would



arise as to what really constitutes contraband of war; that ships



themselves would undoubtedly be considered as contraband, since



they can be used in conveying troops, coal, supplies, etc.











June 5.







Having given up the morning of the 5th mainly to work on plans of



arbitration, mediation, and the like, I went to the meeting, at



the "House in the Wood," of the third great committee of the



conference--namely, that on arbitration.







The session went off satisfactorily, our duty being to pass upon



the report from the subcommittee which had put the various



propositions into shape for our discussion. The report was



admirably presented by M. Descamps, and, after considerable



discussion of details, was adopted in all essential features. The



matters thus discussed and accepted for presentation to the



conference as a whole related:







(1) To a plan for tendering "good offices."







(2) To a plan for examining into international differences.







(3) To the "special mediation" plan.







The last was exceedingly well received, and our delegation has



obtained much credit for it. It is the plan of allowing any two



nations drifting into war to appoint "seconding nations," who,



like "seconds" in a duel, shall attempt to avert the conflict;



and, if this be unsuccessful, shall continue acting in the same



capacity, and endeavor to arrest the conflict at the earliest



moment possible.







Very general good feeling was shown, and much encouragement



derived from the fact that these preliminary matters could be



dealt with in so amicable and business-like a spirit.







Before the meeting I took a long walk in the garden back of the



palace with various gentlemen, among them Mr. van Karnebeek, who



discussed admirably with me the question of the exemption of



private property from seizure on the high seas. He agreed with me



that even if the extreme doctrine now contended for--namely, that



which makes ships, coal, provisions, and very nearly everything



else, contraband--be pressed, still a first step, such as the



exemption of private property from seizure, would be none the



less wise, leaving the subordinate questions to be dealt with as



they arise.







I afterward called with Dr. Holls at the house of the burgomaster



of The Hague, and thanked him for his kindness in tendering us



the concert last Saturday, and for various other marks of



consideration.







On the whole, matters continue to look encouraging as regards



both mediation and arbitration.











June 6.







In the morning Sir Julian Pauncefote called, and again went over



certain details in the American, British, and Russian plans of



arbitration, discussing some matters to be stricken out and



others to be inserted. He declared his readiness to strike out a



feature of his plan to which from the first, I have felt a very



great objection--namely, that which, after the tribunal is



constituted, allows the contesting parties to call into it and



mix with it persons simply chosen by the contestants ad hoc. This



seems to me a dilution of the idea of a permanent tribunal, and a



means of delay and of complications which may prove unfortunate.



It would certainly be said that if the contestants were to be



allowed to name two or more judges from outside the tribunal,



they might just as well nominate all, and thus save the expense



attendant upon a regularly constituted international court chosen



by the various governments.







Later in the day I wrote a private letter to the Secretary of



State suggesting that our American delegation be authorized to



lay a wreath of silver and gold upon the tomb of Grotius at



Delft, not only as a tribute to the man who set in motion the



ideas which, nearly three hundred years later, have led to the



assembling of this conference, but as an indication of our



gratitude to the Netherlands Government for its hospitality and



the admirable provision it has made for our work here, and also



as a sign of good-will toward the older governments of the world



on the occasion of their first meeting with delegates from the



new world, in a conference treating of matters most important to



all nations.







In the evening to Mr. van Karnebeek's reception, and there met



Mr. Raffalovitch, one of the Russian secretaries of the



conference, who, as councilor of the Russian Empire and



corresponding member of the French Institute, has a European



reputation, and urged him to aid in striking out the clause in



the plan which admits judges other than those of the court. My



hope is that it will disappear in the subcommittee and not come



up in the general meeting of the third great committee.











June 8.







The American delegation in the afternoon discussed at length the



proposals relating to the Brussels Conference rules for the more



humane carrying on of war. Considerable difference of opinion has



arisen in the section of the conference in which the preliminary



debates are held, and Captain Crozier, our representative, has



been in some doubt as to the ground to be taken between these



opposing views. On one side are those who think it best to go at



considerable length into more or less minute restrictions upon



the conduct of invaders and invaded. On the other side, M.



Bernaert of Belgium, one of the two most eminent men from that



country, and others, take the ground that it would be better to



leave the whole matter to the general development of humanity in



international law. M. de Martens insists that now is the time to



settle the matter, rather than leave it to individuals who, in



time of war, are likely to be more or less exasperated by



accounts of atrocities and to have no adequate time for deciding



upon a policy. After considerable discussion by our delegation,



the whole matter went over.







In the evening to a great reception at the house of Sir Henry



Howard, British minister at this court. It was very brilliant,



and the whole afforded an example of John Bull's good sense in



providing for his representatives abroad, and enabling them to



exercise a social influence on the communities where they are



stationed, which rapidly becomes a political influence with the



governments to which they are accredited. Sir Henry is provided



with a large, attractive house, means to entertain amply, and has



been kept in the service long enough to know everybody and to



become experienced in the right way of getting at the men he



wishes to influence, and of doing the things his government needs



to have done. Throughout the whole world this is John Bull's wise



way of doing things. At every capital I have visited, including



Washington, Constantinople, St. Petersburg, Rome, Paris, Berlin,



and Vienna, the British representative is a man who has been



selected with reference to his fitness, kept in the service long



enough to give him useful experience, and provided with a good,



commodious house and the means to exercise social and, therefore,



political influence. The result is that, although, in every



country in the world, orators and editors are always howling at



John Bull, he everywhere has his way: to use our vernacular, he



"gets there," and can laugh in his sleeve at the speeches against



him in public bodies, and at the diatribes against him in



newspapers. The men who are loudest in such attacks are generally



the most delighted to put their legs under the British



ambassador's mahogany, or to take their daughters to his



receptions and balls, and then quietly to follow the general line



of conduct which he favors.











June 9.







In the morning an interesting visit from M. de Staal, president



of the conference. We discussed arbitration plans, Brussels rules



and Geneva rules, and, finally, our social debts to the Dutch



authorities.







As to the general prospects of arbitration, he expressed the



belief that we can, by amalgamating the British, Russian, and



American plans, produce a good result







During the day, many members of the conference having gone to



Rotterdam to see the welcoming of the Queen in that city, I took



up, with especial care, the Brussels rules for the conduct of



war, and the amendments of them now proposed in the conference,



some of which have provoked considerable debate. The more I read



the proposals now made, the more admirable most of them seem to



be, and the more it seems to me that we ought, with a few



exceptions, to adopt them. Great Britain declines to sanction



them as part of international law, but still agrees to adopt them



as a general basis for her conduct in time of war; and even this



would be a good thing for us, if we cannot induce our government



to go to the length of making them fully binding.







At six o'clock Dr. Holls, who represents us upon the subcommittee



on arbitration, came in with most discouraging news. It now



appears that the German Emperor is determined to oppose the whole



scheme of arbitration, and will have nothing to do with any plan



for a regular tribunal, whether as given in the British or the



American scheme. This news comes from various sources, and is



confirmed by the fact that, in the subcommittee, one of the



German delegates, Professor Zorn of Konigsberg, who had become



very earnest in behalf of arbitration, now says that he may not



be able to vote for it. There are also signs that the German



Emperor is influencing the minds of his allies--the sovereigns of



Austria, Italy, Turkey, and Roumania--leading them to oppose it.







Curiously enough, in spite of this, Count Nigra, the Italian



ambassador at Vienna and head of the Italian delegation, made a



vigorous speech showing the importance of the work in which the



committee is engaged, urging that the plan be perfected, and



seeming to indicate that he will go on with the representatives



who favor it. This, coming from perhaps the most earnest ally of



Germany, is noteworthy.







At the close of the session Sir Julian Pauncefote informed Dr.



Holls that he was about to telegraph his government regarding the



undoubted efforts of the German Emperor upon the sovereigns above



named, and I decided to cable our State Department, informing



them fully as to this change in the condition of affairs.







At eight went to the dinner of our minister, Mr. Newel and found



there three ambassadors, De Staal, Munster, and Pauncefote, as



well as M. Leon Bourgeois, president of the French delegation;



Sir Henry Howard, the British minister; Baron de Bildt, the



Swedish minister; and some leading Netherlands statesmen. Had a



long talk with M. de Staal and with Sir Julian Pauncefote



regarding the state of things revealed this afternoon in the



subcommittee on arbitration. M. de Staal has called a meeting of



the heads of delegations for Saturday afternoon. Both he and Sir



Julian are evidently much vexed by the unfortunate turn things



have taken. The latter feels, as I do, that the only thing to be



done is to go on and make the plan for arbitration as perfect as



possible, letting those of the powers who are willing to do so



sign it. I assured him and De Staal that we of the United States



would stand by them to the last in the matter.







Late in the evening went to a reception of M. de Beaufort, the



Netherlands minister of foreign affairs, and discussed current



matters with various people, among them Count Nigra, whom I



thanked for his eloquent speech in the afternoon, and Baron de



Bildt, who feels as I do, that the right thing for us is to go



on, no matter who falls away.











June 10.







This morning I gave to studies of the various reports sent in



from the subcommittees, especially those on arbitration and on



the Brussels Conference rules. Both have intensely interested me,



my main attention being, of course, centered on the former; but



the Brussels rules seem to me of much greater importance now than



at first, and my hope is that we shall not only devise a good



working plan of arbitration, but greatly humanize the laws of



war.







At four o'clock in the afternoon met the four other ambassadors



and two or three other heads of delegations, at the rooms of M.



de Staal, to discuss the question of relaxing the rules of



secrecy as regards the proceedings of committees, etc. The whole



original Russian plan of maintaining absolute secrecy has



collapsed, just as the representatives from constitutional



countries in the beginning said it would. Every day there are



published minute accounts in Dutch, French, and English journals



which show that, in some way, their representatives obtain enough



information to enable them, with such additional things as they



can imagine, to make readable reports. The result is that various



gentlemen in the conference who formerly favored a policy of



complete secrecy find themselves credited with speeches which



they did not make, and which they dislike to be considered



capable of making.







After a great deal of talk, it was decided to authorize the



chairman of each committee to give to the press complete reports,



so far as possible, keeping in the background the part taken by



individuals.







At six the American delegation met, and the subject of our



instructions regarding the presentation of the American view of



the immunity of private property on the high seas in time of war



was taken up. It was decided to ask some of the leading



supporters of this view to meet us at luncheon at 12.30 on



Monday, in order to discuss the best way of overcoming the



Russian plan of suppressing the matter, and to concert means for



getting the whole subject before the full conference.











June 11.







Instead of going to hear the Bishop of Hereford preach on



"Peace," I walked with Dr. Holls to Scheveningen, four miles, to



work off a nervous headache and to invite Count Munster to our



luncheon on Monday, when we purpose to take counsel together



regarding private property on the high seas. He accepted, but was



out of humor with nearly all the proceedings of the conference.



He is more than ever opposed to arbitration, and declares that,



in view of the original Russian programme under which we were



called to meet, we have no right to take it up at all, since it



was not mentioned. He was decidedly pessimistic regarding the



continuance of the sessions, asking me when I thought it would



all end; and on my answering that I had not the slightest idea,



he said that he was entirely in the dark on the subject; that



nobody could tell how long it would last, or how it would break



off.











June 12.







At half-past twelve came our American luncheon to Count Munster,



Mr. van Karnebeek, and Baron de Bildt, each of whom is at the



head of his delegation,--our purpose being to discuss with them



the best manner of getting the subject of immunity of private



property at sea, not contraband, before the conference, these



gentlemen being especially devoted to such a measure.







All went off very well, full interchange of views took place, and



the general opinion was that the best way would be for us, as the



only delegation instructed on the subject, to draw up a formal



memorial asking that the question be brought before the



conference, and sending this to M. de Staal as our president.







Curious things came out during our conversation Baron de Bildt



informed me that, strongly as he favored the measure, and



prepared as he was to vote for it, he should have to be very



careful in discussing it publicly, since his instructions were to



avoid, just as far as possible, any clash between the opinions



expressed by the Swedish representatives and those of the great



powers. Never before have I so thoroughly realized the difficult



position which the lesser powers in Europe hold as regards really



serious questions.







More surprising was the conversation of Count Munster, he being



on one side of me and Mr. van Karnebeek on the other. Bearing in



mind that the Emperor William during his long talk with me just



before I left Berlin in referring to the approaching Peace



Congress had said that he was sending Count Munster because what



the conference would most need would be "common sense," and



because, in his opinion, Count Munster had "lots of it," some of



the count's utterances astonished me. He now came out, as he did



the day before in his talk with me, utterly against arbitration,



declaring it a "humbug," and that we had no right to consider it,



since it was not mentioned in the first proposals from Russia,



etc., etc.







A little later, something having been said about telegraphs and



telephones, he expressed his belief that they are a curse as



regards the relations between nations; that they interfere with



diplomacy, and do more harm than good. This did not especially



surprise me, for I had heard the same opinions uttered by others;



but what did surprise me greatly was to hear him say, when the



subject of bacteria and microbes was casually mentioned, that



they were "all a modern humbug."







It is clear that, with all his fine qualities,--and he is really



a splendid specimen of an old-fashioned German nobleman devoted



to the diplomatic service of his country, --he is saturated with



the ideas of fifty years ago.







Returning from a drive to Scheveningen with Major Burbank of the



United States army, I sketched the first part of a draft for a



letter from our delegation to M. de Staal, and at our meeting at



six presented it, when it met with general approval. President



Low had also sketched a draft which it was thought could be



worked very well into the one which I had offered, and so we two



were made a subcommittee to prepare the letter in full.











June 13.







This morning come more disquieting statements regarding Germany.



There seems no longer any doubt that the German Emperor is



opposing arbitration, and, indeed, the whole work of the



conference, and that he will insist on his main allies, Austria



and Italy, going with him. Count Nigra, who is personally devoted



to arbitration, allowed this in talking with Dr. Holls; and the



German delegates--all of whom, with the exception of Count



Munster, are favorably inclined to a good arbitration plan--show



that they are disappointed.







I had learned from a high imperial official, before I left



Berlin, that the Emperor considered arbitration as derogatory to



his sovereignty, and I was also well aware, from his



conversation, that he was by no means in love with the conference



idea; but, in view of his speech at Wiesbaden, and the petitions



which had come in to him from Bavaria, I had hoped that he had



experienced a "change of heart."







Possibly he might have changed his opinion had not Count Munster



been here, reporting to him constantly against every step taken



by the conference.







There seems danger of a catastrophe. Those of us who are faithful



to arbitration plans will go on and do the best we can; but there



is no telling what stumbling-blocks Germany and her allies may



put in our way; and, of course, the whole result, without their



final agreement, will seem to the world a failure and, perhaps, a



farce.







The immediate results will be that the Russian Emperor will



become an idol of the "plain people" throughout the world, the



German Emperor will be bitterly hated, and the socialists, who



form the most dreaded party on the continent of Europe, will be



furnished with a thoroughly effective weapon against their



rulers.







Some days since I said to a leading diplomatist here, "The



ministers of the German Emperor ought to tell him that, should he



oppose arbitration, there will be concentrated upon him an amount



of hatred which no minister ought to allow a sovereign to incur."



To this he answered, "That is true; but there is not a minister



in Germany who dares tell him."











June 14.







This noon our delegation gave a breakfast to sundry members of



the conference who are especially interested in an effective plan



of arbitration, the principal of these being Count Nigra from



Italy; Count Welsersheimb, first delegate of Austria; M. Descamps



of Belgium; Baron d'Estournelles of France; and M. Asser of the



Netherlands. After some preliminary talk, I read to them the



proposal, which Sir Julian had handed me in the morning, for the



purpose of obviating the objection to the council of



administration in charge of the court of arbitration here in The



Hague, which was an important feature of his original plan, but



which had been generally rejected as involving expensive



machinery. His proposal now is that, instead of a council



specially appointed and salaried to watch over and provide for



the necessities of the court, such council shall simply be made



up of the ministers of sundry powers residing here,--thus doing



away entirely with the trouble and expense of a special council.







This I amended by adding the Netherlands minister of foreign



affairs as ex-officio president, there being various reasons for



this, and among these the fact that, without some such provision,



the Netherlands would have no representative in the council.







The plan and my amendment were well received, and I trust that



our full and friendly discussion of these and various matters



connected with them will produce a good effect in the committees.







Count Nigra expressed himself to me as personally most earnestly



in favor of arbitration, but it was clear that his position was



complicated by the relations of his country to Germany as one of



the Triple Alliance; and the same difficulty was observable in



the case of Count Welsersheimb, the representative of Austria,



the third ally in the combination of which Germany is the head.







In the course of our breakfast, Baron d'Estournelles made a



statement which I think impressed every person present. It was



that, as he was leaving Paris, Jaures, the famous socialist, whom



he knows well, said to him, "Go on; do all you can at The Hague,



but you will labor in vain: you can accomplish nothing there,



your schemes will fail, and we shall triumph," or words to that



effect. So clear an indication as this of the effect which a



failure of the conference to produce a good scheme of arbitration



will have in promoting the designs of the great international



socialist and anarchist combinations cannot fail to impress every



thinking man.







Dined in the evening with the French minister at this court, and



very pleasantly. There were present M. Leon Bourgeois, the French



first delegate, and the first delegates from Japan, China,



Mexico, and Turkey, with subordinate delegates from other



countries. Sitting next the lady at the right of the host, I



found her to be the wife of the premier, M. Piersoon, minister of



finance, and very agreeable. I took in to dinner Madame Behrends,



wife of the Russian charge, evidently a very thoughtful and



accomplished woman, who was born, as she told me, of English



parents in the city of New York when her father and mother were



on their way to England. I found her very interesting, and her



discussions of Russia, as well as of England and the Netherlands,



especially good.







In the smoking-room I had a long talk with M. Leon Bourgeois,



who, according to the papers, is likely to be appointed minister



of foreign affairs in the new French cabinet. He dwelt upon the



difficulties of any plan for a tribunal, but seemed ready to do



what he could for the compromise plan, which is all that, during



some time past, we have hoped to adopt.











June 15.







Early this morning Count Munster called, wishing to see me



especially, and at once plunged into the question of the immunity



of private property from seizure on the high seas. He said that



he had just received instructions from his government to join us



heartily in bringing the question before the conference; that his



government, much as it inclines to favor the principle, could not



yet see its way to commit itself fully; that its action must, of



course, depend upon the conduct of other powers in the matter, as



foreshadowed by discussions in the conference, but that he was to



aid us in bringing it up.







I told him I was now preparing a draft of a memorial to the



conference giving the reasons why the subject ought to be



submitted, and that he should have it as soon as completed.







This matter being for the time disposed of, we took up the state



of the arbitration question, and the consequences of opposition



by Germany and her two allies to every feasible plan.







He was very much in earnest, and declared especially against



compulsory arbitration. To this I answered that the plan thus far



adopted contemplated entirely voluntary arbitration, with the



exception that an obligatory system was agreed upon as regards



sundry petty matters in which arbitration would assist all the



states concerned; and that if he disliked this latter feature,



but would agree to the others, we would go with him in striking



it out, though we should vastly prefer to retain it.







He said, "Yes; you have already stricken out part of it in the



interest of the United States," referring to the features



concerning the Monroe Doctrine, the regulation of canals, rivers,



etc.







"Very true," I answered; "and if there are any special features



which affect unfavorably German policy or interests, move to



strike them out, and we will heartily support you."







He then dwelt in his usual manner on his special hobby, which is



that modern nations are taking an entirely false route in



preventing the settlement of their difficulties by trained



diplomatists, and intrusting them to arbitration by men



inexperienced in international matters, who really cannot be



unprejudiced or uninfluenced; and he spoke with especial contempt



of the plan for creating a bureau, composed, as he said, of



university professors and the like, to carry on the machinery of



the tribunal.







Here I happened to have a trump card. I showed him Sir Julian



Pauncefote's plan to substitute a council composed of all the



ministers of the signatory powers residing at The Hague, with my



amendment making the Dutch minister of foreign affairs its



president. This he read and said he liked it; in fact, it seemed



to remove a mass of prejudice from his mind.







I then spoke very earnestly to him--more so than ever



before--about the present condition of affairs. I told him that



the counselors in whom the Emperor trusted--such men as himself



and the principal advisers of his Majesty--ought never to allow



their young sovereign to be exposed to the mass of hatred,



obloquy, and opposition which would converge upon him from all



nations in case he became known to the whole world as the



sovereign who had broken down the conference and brought to



naught the plan of arbitration. I took the liberty of telling him



what the Emperor said to me regarding the count himself--namely,



that what the conference was most likely to need was good common



sense, and that he was sending Count Munster because he possessed



that. This seemed to please him, and I then went on to say that



he of all men ought to prevent, by all means, placing the young



Emperor in such a position. I dwelt on the gifts and graces of



the young sovereign, expressed my feeling of admiration for his



noble ambitions, for his abilities, for the statesmanship he had



recently shown, for his grasp of public affairs, and for his way



of conciliating all classes, and then dwelt on the pity of making



such a monarch an object of hatred in all parts of the world.







He seemed impressed by this, but said the calling of the



conference was simply a political trick--the most detestable



trick ever practised. It was done, he said mainly to embarrass



Germany, to glorify the young Russian Emperor, and to put Germany



and nations which Russia dislikes into a false position. To this



I answered, "If this be the case, why not trump the Russian



trick? or, as the poker-players say, 'Go them one better,' take



them at their word, support a good tribunal of arbitration more



efficient even than the Russians have dared to propose; let your



sovereign throw himself heartily into the movement and become a



recognized leader and power here; we will all support him, and to



him will come the credit of it.







"Then, in addition to this, support us as far as you can as



regards the immunity of private property on the high seas, and



thus you will gain another great point; for, owing to her



relations to France, Russia has not dared commit herself to this



principle as otherwise she doubtless would have done, but, on the



contrary, has opposed any consideration of it by the conference.







"Next, let attention be called to the fact--and we will gladly



aid in making the world fully aware of it--that Germany, through



you, has constantly urged the greatest publicity of our



proceedings, while certain other powers have insisted on secrecy



until secrecy has utterly broken down, and then have made the



least concession possible. In this way you will come out of the



conference triumphant, and the German Emperor will be looked upon



as, after all, the arbiter of Europe. Everybody knows that France



has never wished arbitration, and that Russian statesmen are



really, at heart, none too ardent for it. Come forward, then, and



make the matter thoroughly your own; and, having done this,



maintain your present attitude strongly as regards the two other



matters above named,--that is, the immunity from seizure of



private property on the high seas, and the throwing open of our



proceedings,--and the honors of the whole conference is yours."







He seemed impressed by all this, and took a different tone from



any which has been noted in him since we came together. I then



asked him if he had heard Baron d'Estournelles's story. He said



that he had not. I told it to him, as given in my diary



yesterday; and said, "You see there what the failure to obtain a



result which is really so much longed for by all the peoples of



the world will do to promote the designs of the socialistic



forces which are so powerful in all parts of the Continent, and



nowhere more so than in Germany and the nations allied with her."







This, too, seemed to impress him. I then went on to say, "This is



not all. By opposing arbitration, you not only put a club into



the hands of socialists, anarchists, and all the other



anti-social forces, but you alienate the substantial middle class



and the great body of religious people in all nations. You have



no conception of the depth of feeling on this subject which



exists in my own country, to say nothing of others; and if



Germany stands in the way, the distrust of her which Americans



have felt, and which as minister and ambassador at Berlin I have



labored so hard to dispel, will be infinitely increased. It will



render more and more difficult the maintenance of proper



relations between the two countries. Your sovereign will be



looked upon as the enemy of all nations, and will be exposed to



every sort of attack and calumny, while the young Emperor of



Russia will become a popular idol throughout the world, since he



will represent to the popular mind, and even to the minds of



great bodies of thinking and religious people, the effort to



prevent war and to solve public questions as much as possible



without bloodshed; while the Emperor of Germany will represent to



their minds the desire to solve all great questions by force.



Mind, I don't say this is a just view: I only say that it is the



view sure to be taken, and that by resisting arbitration here you



are playing the game of Russia, as you yourself have stated



it--that is, you are giving Russia the moral support of the whole



world at the expense of the neighboring powers, and above all of



Germany."







I then took up an argument which, it is understood, has had much



influence with the Emperor,--namely, that arbitration must be in



derogation of his sovereignty,--and asked, "How can any such



derogation be possible? Your sovereign would submit only such



questions to the arbitration tribunal as he thought best; and,



more than all that, you have already committed yourselves to the



principle. You are aware that Bismarck submitted the question of



the Caroline Islands for arbitration to the Pope, and the first



Emperor William consented to act as arbiter between the United



States and Great Britain in the matter of the American



northwestern boundary. How could arbitration affect the true



position of the sovereign? Take, for example, matters as they now



stand between Germany and the United States. There is a vast mass



of petty questions which constantly trouble the relations between



the two countries. These little questions embitter debates,



whether in your Reichstag on one hand, or in our Congress on the



other, and make the position of the Berlin and Washington



governments especially difficult. The American papers attack me



because I yield too much to Germany, the German papers attack Von



Bulow because he yields too much to America, and these little



questions remain. If Von Bulow and I were allowed to sit down and



settle them, we could do so at short notice; but behind him



stands the Reichstag, and behind our Secretary of State and



myself stands the American Congress."







I referred to such questions as the tonnage dues, the additional



tariff on bounty-promoted sugar, Samoa, the most-favored-nation



clause, in treaties between Germany and the United States, in



relation to the same clause in sundry treaties between the United



States and other powers, and said, "What a blessing it would be



if all these questions, of which both governments are tired, and



which make the more important questions constantly arising



between the two countries so difficult to settle, could be sent



at once to a tribunal and decided one way or the other! In



themselves they amount to little. It is not at all unlikely that



most of them--possibly all of them--would be decided in favor of



Germany; but the United States would acquiesce at once in the



decision by a tribunal such as is proposed. And this is just what



would take place between Germany and other nations. A mass of



vexatious questions would be settled by the tribunal, and the



sovereign and his government would thus be relieved from



parliamentary chicanery based, not upon knowledge, but upon party



tactics or personal grudges or inherited prejudices."







He seemed now more inclined to give weight to these



considerations, and will, I hope, urge his government to take a



better view than that which for some time past has seemed to be



indicated by the conduct of its representatives here.







In the afternoon I went to the five-o'clock tea of the Baroness



d'Estournelles, found a great crowd there, including the leading



delegates, and all anxious as to the conduct of Germany. Meeting



the Baroness von Suttner who has been writing such earnest books



in behalf of peace, I urged her to write with all her might to



influence public prints in Austria, Italy, and Germany in behalf



of arbitration, telling her that we are just arriving at the



parting of the ways, and that everything possible must be done



now, or all may be lost. To this she responded very heartily, and



I have no doubt will use her pen with much effect.







In the evening went to a great reception at the house of the



Austrian ambassador, M. Okolicsanyi. There was a crush. Had a



long talk with Mr. Stead, telling him D'Estournelles's story, and



urging him to use it in every way to show what a boon the failure



of arbitration would be to the anti-social forces in all parts of



Europe.







In the intervals during the day I busied myself in completing the



memorial to the conference regarding the immunity from seizure of



private property at sea. If we cannot secure it now, we must at



least pave the way for its admission by a future international



conference.















CHAPTER XLVIII







AS PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN DELEGATION AT THE PEACE CONFERENCE



OF THE HAGUE: IV--1899







June 16. This morning Count Munster called and seemed much



excited by the fact that he had received a despatch from Berlin



in which the German Government--which, of course, means the



Emperor--had strongly and finally declared against everything



like an arbitration tribunal. He was clearly disconcerted by this



too literal acceptance of his own earlier views, and said that he



had sent to M. de Staal insisting that the meeting of the



subcommittee on arbitration, which had been appointed for this



day (Friday), should be adjourned on some pretext until next



Monday; "for," said he, "if the session takes place to-day, Zorn



must make the declaration in behalf of Germany which these new



instructions order him to make, and that would be a misfortune."



I was very glad to see this evidence of change of heart in the



count, and immediately joined him in securing the adjournment he



desired. The meeting of the subcommittee has therefore been



deferred, the reason assigned, as I understand, being that Baron



d'Estournelles is too much occupied to be present at the time



first named. Later Count Munster told me that he had decided to



send Professor Zorn to Berlin at once in order to lay the whole



matter before the Foreign Office and induce the authorities to



modify the instructions. I approved this course strongly,



whereupon he suggested that I should do something to the same



purpose, and this finally ended in the agreement that Holls



should go with Zorn.







In view of the fact that Von Bulow had agreed that the German



delegates should stand side by side with us in the conference, I



immediately prepared a letter of introduction and a personal



letter to Bulow for Holls to take, and he started about five in



the afternoon. This latter is as follows:                         



                   



(Copy.) (Personal.)







                                               June 16, 1899



DEAR BARON VON BULOW:







I trust that, in view of the kindly relations which exist between



us, succeeding as they do similar relations begun twenty years



ago with your honored father, you will allow me to write you



informally, but fully and frankly, regarding the interests of



both our governments in the peace conference. The relations



between your delegates and ours have, from the first, been of the



kindest; your assurances on this point have been thoroughly



carried out. But we seem now to be at "the parting of the ways,"



and on the greatest question submitted to us,--the greatest, as I



believe, that any conference or any congress has taken up in our



time,--namely, the provision for a tribunal of arbitration.







It is generally said here that Germany is opposed to the whole



thing, that she is utterly hostile to anything like arbitration,



and that she will do all in her power, either alone or through



her allies, to thwart every feasible plan of providing for a



tribunal which shall give some hope to the world of settling some



of the many difficulties between nations otherwise than by



bloodshed.







No rational man here expects all wars to be ended by anything



done here; no one proposes to submit to any such tribunal



questions involving the honor of any nation or the inviolability



of its territory, or any of those things which nations feel



instinctively must be reserved for their own decision. Nor does



any thinking man here propose obligatory arbitration in any case,



save, possibly, in sundry petty matters where such arbitration



would be a help to the ordinary administration of all



governments; and, even as to these, they can be left out of the



scheme if your government seriously desires it.







The great thing is that there be a provision made or easily



calling together a court of arbitration which shall be seen of



all nations, indicate a sincere desire to promote peace, and, in



some measure, relieve the various peoples of the fear which so



heavily oppresses them all--the dread of an outburst of war at



any moment.







I note that it has been believed by many that the motives of



Russia in proposing this conference were none too good,--indeed,



that they were possibly perfidious; but, even if this be granted,



how does this affect the conduct of Germany? Should it not rather



lead Germany to go forward boldly and thoughtfully, to accept the



championship of the idea of arbitration, and to take the lead in



the whole business here?







Germany, if she will do this, will certainly stand before the



whole world as the leading power of Europe; for she can then say



to the whole world that she has taken the proposal of Russia au



serieux; has supported a thoroughly good plan of arbitration; has



done what Russia and France have not been willing to do,--favored



the presentation to the conference of a plan providing for the



immunity of private property from seizure on the high seas during



war,--and that while, as regards the proceedings of the



conference, Russia has wished secrecy, Germany has steadily, from



the first, promoted frankness and openness.







With these three points in your favor, you can stand before the



whole world as the great Continental power which has stood up f



or peace as neither Russia nor France has been able to do. On the



other hand, if you do not do this, if you put a stumbling-block



in the way of arbitration, what results? The other powers will go



on and create as good a tribunal as possible, and whatever



failure may come will be imputed to Germany and to its Emperor.



In any case, whether failure or success may come, the Emperor of



Russia will be hailed in all parts of the world as a deliverer



and, virtually, as a saint, while there will be a wide-spread



outburst of hatred against the German Emperor.







And this will come not alone from the anti-social forces which



are hoping that the conference may fail, in order that thereby



they may have a new weapon in their hands, but it will also come



from the middle and substantial classes of other nations.







It is sure to make the relations between Germany and the United



States, which have been of late improving infinitely more bitter



than they have ever before been and it is no less sure to provoke



the most bitter hatred of the German monarchy in nearly all other



nations.







Should his advisers permit so noble and so gifted a sovereign to



incur this political storm of obloquy, this convergence of hatred



upon him? Should a ruler of such noble ambitions and such



admirable powers be exposed to this? I fully believe that he



should not, and that his advisers should beg him not to place



himself before the world as the antagonist of a plan to which



millions upon millions in all parts of the world are devoted.







From the United States come evidences of a feeling wide-spread



and deep on this subject beyond anything I have ever known. This



very morning I received a prayer set forth by the most



conservative of all Protestant religious bodies--namely, the



American branch of the Anglican Church--to be said in all



churches, begging the Almighty to favor the work of the peace



conference; and this is what is going on in various other



American churches, and in vast numbers of households. Something



of the same sort is true in Great Britain and, perhaps in many



parts of the Continent.







Granted that expectations are overwrought, still this fact



indicates that here is a feeling which cannot be disregarded.







Moreover, to my certain knowledge, within a month, a leading



socialist in France has boasted to one of the members of this



conference that it would end in failure; that the monarchs and



governments of Europe do not wish to diminish bloodshed; that



they would refuse to yield to the desire of the peoples for



peace, and that by the resentment thus aroused a new path to



victory would be open to socialism.







Grant, too, that this is overstated, still such a declaration is



significant.







I know it has been said that arbitration is derogatory to



sovereignty. I really fail to see how this can be said in



Germany. Germany has already submitted a great political question



between herself and Spain to arbitration, and the Emperor William



I was himself the arbiter between the United States and Great



Britain in the matter of our northwestern boundary.







Bear in mind again that it is only VOLUNTARY arbitration that is



proposed, and that it will always rest with the German Emperor to



decide what questions he will submit to the tribunal and what he



will not.







It has also been said that arbitration proceedings would give the



enemies of Germany time to put themselves in readiness for war;



but if this be feared in any emergency, the Emperor and his



government are always free to mobilize the German army at once.







As you are aware, what is seriously proposed here now, in the way



of arbitration, is not a tribunal constantly in session, but a



system under which each of the signatory powers shall be free to



choose, for a limited time, from an international court, say two



or more judges who can go to The Hague if their services are



required, but to be paid only while actually in session here;



such payment to be made by the litigating parties.







As to the machinery, the plan is that there shall be a dignified



body composed of the diplomatic representatives of the various



signatory powers, to sit at The Hague, presided over by the



Netherlands minister of foreign affairs, and to select and to



control such secretaries and officers as may be necessary for the



ordinary conduct of affairs.







Such council would receive notice from powers having differences



with each other which are willing to submit the questions between



them to a court, and would then give notice to the judges



selected by the parties. The whole of the present plan, except



some subordinate features of little account, which can easily be



stricken out, is voluntary. There is nothing whatever obligatory



about it. Every signatory power is free to resort to such a



tribunal or not, as it may think best. Surely a concession like



this may well be made to the deep and wide sentiment throughout



the world in favor of some possible means of settling



controversies between nations other than by bloodshed.







Pardon me for earnestly pressing upon you these facts and



considerations. I beg that you will not consider me as going



beyond my province. I present them to you as man to man, not only



in the interest of good relations between Germany and the United



States, but of interests common to all the great nations of the



earth,--of their common interest in giving something like



satisfaction to a desire so earnest and wide-spread as that which



has been shown in all parts of the world for arbitration.







I remain, dear Baron von Bulow,



Most respectfully and sincerely yours,



                (Sgd.) ANDREW D. WHITE.











P. S. Think how easily, if some such tribunal existed, your



government and mine could refer to it the whole mass of minor



questions which our respective parliamentary bodies have got



control of, and entangled in all sorts of petty prejudices and



demagogical utterances; for instance, Samoa, the tonnage dues,



the sugar-bounty question, the most-favored-nation clause, etc.,



etc., which keep the two countries constantly at loggerheads. Do



you not see that submission of such questions to such a tribunal



as is now proposed, so far from being derogatory to sovereignty,



really relieves the sovereign and the Foreign Office of the most



vexatious fetters and limitations of parliamentarianism. It is



not at all unlikely that such a court would decide in your favor;



and if so, every thoughtful American would say, "Well and good;



it appears that, in spite of all the speeches in Congress, we



were wrong." And the matter would then be ended with the



good-will of all parties.                     



(Sgd.) A.D.W.











It is indeed a crisis in the history of the conference, and



perhaps in the history of Germany. I can only hope that Bulow



will give careful attention to the considerations which Munster



and myself press upon him.







Later in the day Sir Julian Pauncefote called, evidently much



vexed that the sitting of the subcommittee had been deferred, and



even more vexed since he had learned from De Staal the real



reason. He declared that he was opposed to stringing out the



conference much longer; that the subcommittee could get along



perfectly well without Dr. Zorn; that if Germany did not wish to



come in, she could keep out; etc., etc. He seemed to forget that



Germany's going out means the departure of Austria and Italy, to



say nothing of one or two minor powers, and therefore the



bringing to naught of the conference. I did not think it best to



say anything about Molls's departure, but soothed him as much as



I could by dwelling on the success of his proposal that the



permanent council here shall be composed of the resident



diplomatic representatives.







The other members of our commission, and especially President





Low, were at first very much opposed to Dr. Holls's going, on the



ground that it might be considered an interference in a matter



pertaining to Germany; but I persisted in sending him, agreeing



to take all the responsibility, and declaring that he should go



simply as a messenger from me, as the American ambassador at



Berlin, to the imperial minister of foreign affairs.







June 17.







The morning was given largely to completing my draft of our



memorial to the conference regarding the immunity of private



property in time of war from seizure on the high seas.







In the afternoon drove to Scheveningen to make sundry official



visits, and in the evening to the great festival given by the



Netherlands Government to the conference.







Its first feature was a series of tableaux representing some of



the most famous pictures in the Dutch galleries the most



successful of all being Rembrandt's "Night Watch." Jan Steen's



"Wedding Party" was also very beautiful. Then came peasant dances



given, in the midst of the great hall, by persons in the costumes



of all the different provinces. These were characteristic and



interesting, some of them being wonderfully quaint.







The violinist of the late King, Johannes Wolff, played some solos



in a masterly way.







The music by the great military band, especially the hymn of



William of Nassau and the Dutch and Russian national anthems, was



splendidly rendered, and the old Dutch provincial music played in



connection with the dances and tableaux was also noteworthy.







It was an exceedingly brilliant assemblage, and the whole



festival from first to last a decided success.











June 18, Sunday.







Went to Leyden to attend service at St. Peter's. Both the church



and its monuments are interesting. Visited also the church of St.



Pancras, a remarkable specimen of Gothic architecture, and looked



upon the tomb of Van der Werf, the brave burgomaster who defended



the town against the Spaniards during the siege.







At the university I was much interested in the public hall where



degrees are conferred, and above all in the many portraits of



distinguished professors. Lingered next in the botanical gardens



back of the university, which are very beautiful.







Then to the Museum of Antiquities, which is remarkably rich in



Egyptian and other monuments. Roman art is also very fully



represented.







Thence home, and, on arriving, found, of all men in the world,



Thomas B. Reed, Speaker of our House of Representatives. Mr.



Newel, our minister, took us both for a drive to Scheveningen,



and Mr. Reed's conversation was exceedingly interesting; he is



well read in history and, apparently, in every field of English



literature. There is a bigness, a heartiness, a shrewdness, and a



genuineness about him which greatly attract me.











June 19.







Called on M. de Staal to show him Holls's telegram from Berlin,



which is encouraging. De Staal thinks that we may have to give up



the tenth section of the arbitration plan, which includes



obligatory arbitration in sundry minor matters; but while I shall



be very sorry to see this done, we ought to make the sacrifice if



it will hold Germany, Italy, and Austria to us.







A little later received a hearty telegram from the Secretary of



State authorizing our ordering the wreath of silver and gold and



placing it on the tomb of Grotius. Telegraphed and wrote Major



Allen at Berlin full directions on the subject. I am determined



that the tribute shall be worthy of our country, of its object,



and of the occasion.







In the afternoon took Speaker Reed, with his wife and daughter,



through the "House in the Wood," afterward through the grounds,



which are more beautiful than ever, and then to Delft, where we



visited the tombs of William the Silent and Grotius, and finally



the house in which William was assassinated. It was even more



interesting to me than during either of my former visits, and was



evidently quite as interesting to Mr. Reed.







At six attended a long meeting of the American delegation, which



elaborated the final draft of our communication to M. de Staal on



the immunity of private property on the high seas. Various



passages were stricken out, some of them--and, indeed, one of the



best--in deference to the ideas of Captain Mahan, who, though he



is willing, under instructions from the government, to join in



presenting the memorial, does not wish to sign anything which can



possibly be regarded as indicating a personal belief in the



establishment of such immunity. His is the natural view of a



sailor; but the argument with which he supports it does not at



all convince me. It is that during war we should do everything



possible to weaken and worry the adversary, in order that he may



be the sooner ready for peace; but this argument proves too much,



since it would oblige us, if logically carried out, to go back to



the marauding and atrocities of the Thirty Years' War.











June 20.







Went to the session of one of the committees at the "House in the



Wood," and showed Mr. van Karnebeek our private-property



memorial, which he read, and on which he heartily complimented



us.







I then made known to him our proposal to lay a wreath on the tomb



of Grotius, and with this he seemed exceedingly pleased, saying



that the minister of foreign affairs, M. de Beaufort, would be



especially delighted, since he is devoted to the memory of



Grotius, and delivered the historical address when the statue in



front of the great church at Delft was unveiled







A little later submitted the memorial; as previously agreed upon,



to Count Munster, who also approved it.







Holls telegraphs me from Berlin that he has been admirably



received by the chancellor, Prince Hohenlohe, and by Baron von



Bulow, and that he is leaving for Hamburg to see the Emperor.







At four P.M. to a meeting of the full conference to receive



report on improvements and extension of the Red Cross rules, etc.



This was adopted in a happy-go-lucky unparliamentary way, for the



eminent diplomatist who presides over the conference still



betrays a Russian lack of acquaintance with parliamentary



proceedings. So begins the first full movement of the conference



in the right direction; and it is a good beginning.







Walked home through the beautiful avenues of the park with Mr.



van Karnebeek and Baron d'Estournelles, who is also a charming



man. He has been a minister plenipotentiary, but is now a member



of the French Chamber of Deputies and of the conference.











June 21.







Early in the morning received a report from Holls, who arrived



from Hamburg late last night. His talks with Bulow and Prince



Hohenlohe had been most encouraging. Bulow has sent to the



Emperor my long private letter to himself, earnestly urging the



acceptance by Germany of our plan of arbitration. Prince



Hohenlohe seems to have entered most cordially into our ideas,



giving Holls a card which would admit him to the Emperor, and



telegraphing a request that his Majesty see him. But the Emperor



was still upon his yacht, at sea, and Holls could stay no longer.



Bulow is trying to make an appointment for him to meet the



Emperor at the close of the week.







Early in the afternoon went with Minister Newel and Mr. Low to



call on M. de Beaufort regarding plans for the Grotius



celebration, on July 4, at Delft. It was in general decided that



we should have the ceremony in the great church at eleven o



'clock, with sundry speeches, and that at half-past twelve the



American delegation should give a luncheon to all the invited



guests in the town hall opposite.







Holls tells me that last night, at the dinner of the president of



the Austrian delegation, he met Munster, who said to him, "I can



get along with Hohenlohe, and also with Bulow, but not with those



d--d lawyers in the Foreign Office" ("Mit Hohenlohe kann tch



auskommen, mit Bulow auch, aber mit diesen verdammten Juristen im



Auswartigen Amt, nicht").











June 22.







Up at four o'clock and at ten attended a session of the first



section at the "House in the Wood." Very interesting were the



discussions regarding bullets and asphyxiating bombs. As to the



former, Sir John Ardagh of the British delegation repelled



earnestly the charges made regarding the British bullets used in



India, and offered to substitute for the original proposal one



which certainly would be much more effective in preventing



unnecessary suffering and death; but the Russians seemed glad to



score a point against Great Britain, and Sir John's proposal was



voted down, its only support being derived from our own



delegation. Captain Crozier, our military delegate, took an



active part in supporting Sir John Ardagh, but the majority



against us was overwhelming.







As to asphyxiating bombs, Captain Mahan spoke at length against



the provision to forbid them: his ground being that not the



slightest thing had yet been done looking to such an invention;



that, even if there had been, their use would not be so bad as



the use of torpedoes against ships of war; that asphyxiating men



by means of deleterious gases was no worse than asphyxiating them



with water; indeed, that the former was the less dangerous of the



two, since the gases used might simply incapacitate men for a



short time, while the blowing up of a ship of war means death to



all or nearly all of those upon it.







To this it was answered--and, as it seemed to me, with



force--that asphyxiating bombs might be used against towns for



the destruction of vast numbers of non-combatants, including



women and children, while torpedoes at sea are used only against



the military and naval forces of the enemy. The original proposal



was carried by a unanimous vote, save ours. I am not satisfied



with our attitude on this question; but what can a layman do when



he has against him the foremost contemporary military and naval



experts? My hope is that the United States will yet stand with



the majority on the record.







I stated afterward in a bantering way to Captain Mahan, as well



as others, that while I could not support any of the arguments



that had been made in favor of allowing asphyxiating bombs, there



was one which somewhat appealed to me--namely, that the dread of



them might do something to prevent the rush of the rural



population to the cities, and the aggregation of the poorer



classes in them, which is one of the most threatening things to



modern society, and also a second argument that such bombs would



bring home to warlike stay-at-home orators and writers the



realities of war.







At noon received the French translation of our memorial to De



Staal, but found it very imperfect throughout, and in some parts



absolutely inadmissible; so I worked with Baron de Bildt,



president of the Swedish delegation here, all the afternoon in



revising it.







At six the American delegation met and chose me for their orator



at the approaching Grotius festival at Delft. I naturally feel



proud to discharge a duty of this kind, and can put my heart into



it, for Grotius has long been to me almost an object of idolatry,



and his main works a subject of earnest study. There are few men



in history whom I so deeply venerate. Twenty years ago, when



minister at Berlin, I sent an eminent American artist to Holland



and secured admirable copies of the two best portraits of the



great man. One of these now hangs in the Law Library of Cornell



University, and the other over my work-table at the Berlin



Embassy.







June 23.







At work all the morning on letters and revising final draft of



memorial on immunity of private property at sea, and lunched



afterward at the "House in the Wood" to talk it over with Baron



de Bildt.







At the same table met M. de Martens, who has just returned by



night to his work here, after presiding a day or two over the



Venezuela arbitration tribunal at Paris. He told me that Sir



Richard Webster, in opening the case, is to speak for sixteen



days, and De Martens added that he himself had read our entire



Venezuelan report, as well as the other documents on the subject



which form quite a large library. And yet we do not include men



like him in "the working-classes"!







In the evening to a reception at the house of M. de Beaufort,



minister of foreign affairs, and was cordially greeted by him and



his wife, both promising that they would accept our invitation to



Delft. I took in to the buffet the wife of the present Dutch



prime minister, who also expressed great interest in our



proposal, and declared her intention of being present.







Count Zanini, the Italian minister and delegate here, gave me a



comical account of two speeches in the session of the first



section this morning; one being by a delegate from Persia, Mirza



Riza Khan, who is minister at St. Petersburg. His Persian



Excellency waxed eloquent over the noble qualities of the Emperor



of Russia, and especially over his sincerity as shown by the fact



that when his Excellency tumbled from his horse at a review, his



Majesty sent twice to inquire after his health. The whole effect



upon the conference was to provoke roars of laughter.







But the great matter of the day was the news, which has not yet



been made public, that Prince Hohenlohe, the German chancellor,



has come out strongly for the arbitration tribunal, and has sent



instructions here accordingly. This is a great gain, and seems to



remove one of the worst stumbling-blocks. But we will have to pay



for this removal, probably, by giving up section 10 of the



present plan, which includes a system of obligatory arbitration



in various minor matters,--a system which would be of use to the



world in many ways. While the American delegation, as stated in



my letter which Holls took to Bulow, and which has been forwarded



to the Emperor, will aid in throwing out of the arbitration plan



everything of an obligatory nature, if Germany insists upon it, I



learn that the Dutch Government is much opposed to this



concession, and may publicly protest against it.







A curious part of the means used in bringing about this change of



opinion was the pastoral letter, elsewhere referred to, issued by



the Protestant Episcopal bishop of Texas, calling for prayers



throughout the State for the success of the conference in its



efforts to diminish the horrors of war. This pastoral letter, to



which I referred in my letter to Minister von Bulow, I intrusted



to Holls, authorizing him to use it as he thought fit. He showed



it to Prince Hohenlohe, and the latter, although a Roman



Catholic, was evidently affected by it, and especially by the



depth and extent of the longing for peace which it showed. It is



perhaps an interesting example of an indirect "answer to prayer,"



since it undoubtedly strengthened the feelings in the prince



chancellor's mind which led him to favor arbitration.











June 24.







Sent to M. de Staal, as president of the conference, the memorial



relating to the exemption of private property, not contraband of



war, from capture on the high seas. Devoted the morning to



blocking out my Grotius address, and afterward drove with Holls



to Delft to look over the ground for our Fourth-of-July festival.



The town hall is interesting and contains, among other portraits,



one which is evidently a good likeness of Grotius; the only



difficulty is that, for our intended luncheon, the rooms, though



beautiful, seem inadequate.







Thence to the church, and after looking over that part of it near



the monuments, with reference to the Grotius ceremony, went into



the organ-loft with the organist. There I listened for nearly an



hour while he and Holls played finely on that noble instrument;



and as I sat and looked down over the church and upon the distant



monuments, the old historic scenes of four hundred years ago came



up before me, with memories almost overpowering of my first visit



thirty-five years ago. And all then with me are now dead.











June 25.







At nine in the morning off with Holls to Rotterdam, and on



arriving took the tram through the city to the steamboat wharf,



going thence by steamer to Dort. Arrived, just before the close



of service, at the great church where various sessions of the



synod were held. The organ was very fine; the choir-stalls, where



those wretched theologians wrangled through so many sessions and



did so much harm to their own country and others, were the only



other fine things in the church, and they were much dilapidated.



I could not but reflect bitterly on the monstrous evils provoked



by these men who sat so long there spinning a monstrous theology



to be substituted for the teachings of Christ himself.







Thence back to The Hague and to Scheveningen, and talked over



conference matters with Count Munster. Received telegrams from



Count von Bulow in answer to mine congratulating him on his



promotion, also one from Baron von Mumm, the German minister at



Luxemburg, who goes temporarily to Washington.











June 26.







At work all the morning on my Grotius address Lunched at the



"House in the Wood," and walked to town with sundry delegates. In



the afternoon went to a "tea" at the house of Madame Boreel and



met a number of charming people; but the great attraction was the



house, which is that formerly occupied by John De Witt--that from



which he went to prison and to assassination. Here also Motley



lived, and I was shown the room in which a large part of his



history was written, and where Queen Sophia used to discuss Dutch



events and personages with him.







The house is beautiful, spacious, and most charmingly decorated,



many of the ornaments and paintings having been placed there in



the time of De Witt.











June 27.







At all sorts of work during the morning, and then, on invitation



of President Low, went with the other members of the delegation



to Haarlem, where we saw the wonderful portraits by Frans Hals,



which impressed me more than ever, and heard the great organ. It



has been rebuilt since I was there thirty-five years ago; but it



is still the same great clumsy machine, and very poorly



played,--that is, with no spirit, and without any effort to



exhibit anything beyond the ordinary effects for which any little



church organ would do as well.







In the evening dined with Count Zanini, the Italian minister and



delegate, and discussed French matters with Baron d'Estournelles.



He represents the best type of French diplomatist, and is in



every way attractive.







Afterward to Mr. van Karnebeek's reception, meeting various



people in a semi-satisfactory way.











June 29.







In the morning, in order to work off the beginnings of a



headache, I went to Rotterdam and walked until noon about the



streets and places, recalling my former visit, which came very



vividly before me as I gazed upon the statue of Erasmus, and



thought upon his life here. No man in history has had more



persistent injustice done him. If my life were long enough I



would gladly use my great collection of Erasmiana in illustrating



his services to the world. To say nothing of other things, the



modern "Higher Criticism" has its roots in his work.











June 30.







Engaged on the final revision of my Grotius speech, and on



various documents.







At noon to the "House in the Wood" for lunch, and afterward took



a walk in the grounds with Beldiman, the Roumanian delegate, who



explained to me the trouble in Switzerland over the vote on the



Red Cross Conference.







It appears that whereas Switzerland initiated the Red Cross



movement, has ever since cherished it, and has been urged by



Italy and other powers to take still further practical measures



for it, the Dutch delegation recently interposed, secured for one



of their number the presidency of the special conference, and



thus threw out my Berlin colleague, Colonel Roth, who had been



previously asked to take the position and had accepted it, with



the result that the whole matter has been taken out of the hands



of Switzerland, where it justly belonged, and put under the care



of the Netherlands. This has provoked much ill feeling in



Switzerland, and there is especial astonishment at the fact that



when Beldiman moved an amendment undoing this unjust arrangement



it was, by some misunderstanding lost, and that therefore there



has been perpetuated what seems much like an injustice against



Switzerland. I promised to exert myself to have the matter



rectified so far as the American delegation was concerned, and



later was successful in doing so.







In the evening dined at Minister Newel's. Sat between Minister



Okolicsanyi of the Austrian delegation, and Count Welsersheimb,



the chairman of that delegation, and had interesting talks with



them, with the Duke of Tetuan, and others. It appears that the



Duke, who is a very charming, kindly man, has, like myself, a



passion both for cathedral architecture and for organ music; he



dwelt much upon Burgos, which he called the gem of Spanish



cathedrals.







Thence to the final reception at the house of M. de Beaufort,



minister of foreign affairs, who showed me a contemporary



portrait of Grotius which displays the traits observable in the



copies which Burleigh painted for me twenty years ago at



Amsterdam and Leyden. Talked with Sir Julian Pauncefote regarding



the Swiss matter; he had abstained from voting for the reason



that he had no instructions in the premises.











July 2.







In the morning Major Allen, military attache of our embassy at



Berlin, arrived, bringing the Grotius wreath. Under Secretary



Hay's permission, I had given to one of the best Berlin



silversmiths virtually carte blanche, and the result is most



satisfactory. The wreath is very large, being made up, on one



side, of a laurel branch with leaves of frosted silver and



berries of gold, and, on the other, of an oak branch with silver



leaves and gold acorns, both boughs being tied together at the



bottom by a large knot of ribbon in silver gilded, bearing the



arms of the Netherlands and the United States on enameled



shields, and an inscription as follows:











     To the Memory of HUGO GROTIUS;



           In Reverence and Gratitude,



      From the United States of America;



  On the Occasion of the International Peace Conference           



            of The Hague.



           July 4th, 1899.











It is a superb piece of work, and its ebony case, with silver



clasps, and bearing a silver shield with suitable inscription, is



also perfect: the whole thing attracts most favorable attention.















 CHAPTER XLIX







AS PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN DELEGATION AT THE PEACE CONFERENCE



OF THE HAGUE: V--1899







July 4.







On this day the American delegation invited their colleagues to



celebrate our national anniversary at the tomb of Grotius, first



in the great church, and afterward in the town hall of Delft.



Speeches were made by the minister of foreign affairs of the



Netherlands De Beaufort; by their first delegate, Van Karnebeek;



by Mr. Asser, one of their leading jurists; by the burgomaster of



Delft; and by Baron de Bildt, chairman of the Swedish delegation



and minister at Rome, who read a telegram from the King of Sweden



referring to Grotius's relations to the Swedish diplomatic



service; as well as by President Low of Columbia University and



myself: the duty being intrusted to me of laying the wreath upon



Grotius's tomb and making the address with reference to it. As



all the addresses are to be printed, I shall give no more



attention to them here. A very large audience was present,



embracing the ambassadors and principal members of the



conference, the Netherlands ministers of state, professors from



the various universities of the Netherlands, and a large body of



other invited guests.







The music of the chimes, of the organ, and of the royal choir of



one hundred voices was very fine; and, although the day was



stormy, with a high wind and driving rain, everything went off



well.







After the exercises in the church, our delegation gave a



breakfast, which was very satisfactory. About three hundred and



fifty persons sat down to the tables at the town hall, and one



hundred other guests, including the musicians, at the leading



restaurant in the place. In the afternoon the Americans gathered



at the reception given by our minister, Mr. Newel, and his wife,



and in the evening there was a large attendance at an "American



concert" given by the orchestra at the great hall in



Scheveningen.







July 5.







Early in the morning to the second committee of the conference,



where I spoke in behalf of the Beldiman resolution, doing justice



to Switzerland as regards the continuance of the Red Cross



interests in Swiss hands; and on going to a vote we were



successful.







Then, the question of a proper dealing with our memorial



regarding the immunity of private property on the high seas



coming up, I spoke in favor of referring it to the general



conference, and gave the reasons why it should not simply be



dropped out as not coming within the subjects contemplated in the



call to the conference. Though my speech was in French, it went



off better than I expected.







In the afternoon, at the full conference, the same subject came



up; and then, after a preface in French, asking permission to



speak in English, I made my speech, which, probably, three



quarters of all the delegates understood, but, at my request, a



summary of it was afterward given in French by Mr. van Karnebeek.







The occasion of this speech was my seconding the motion, made in



a very friendly manner by M. de Martens, to refer the matter to a



future conference; but I went into the merits of the general



subject to show its claims upon the various nations, etc., etc.,



though not, of course, as fully as I would have done had the



matter been fully under discussion. My speech was very well



received, and will, I hope, aid in keeping the subject alive.







In the afternoon drove to Ryswyck, to the house of M. Cornets de



Groot, the living representative of the Grotius family. The house



and grounds were very pleasant, but the great attraction was a



collection of relics of Grotius, including many manuscripts from



his own hand, --among these a catechism for his children, written



in the prison of Loewenstein; with official documents, signed and



sealed, connected with the public transactions of his time; also



letters which passed between him and Oxenstiern, the great



Swedish chancellor, some in Latin and some in other languages;



besides sundry poems. There were also a multitude of portraits,



engravings, and documents relating to Olden-Barneveld and others



of Grotius's contemporaries.







The De Groot family gave us a most hearty reception, introducing



their little girl, who is the latest-born descendant of Grotius,



and showing us various household relics of their great ancestor,



including cups, glasses, and the like. Mr. De Groot also gave me



some curious information regarding him which I did not before



possess; and, among other things, told me that when Grotius's



body was transferred, shortly after his death, from Rostock to



Delft, the coffin containing it was stoned by a mob at Rotterdam;



also that at the unveiling of the statue of Grotius in front of



the church at Delft, a few years ago, the high-church Calvinists



would not allow the children from their church schools to join



the other children in singing hymns. The old bitterness of the



extreme Calvinistic party toward their great compatriot was thus



still exhibited, and the remark was made at the time, by a member



of it, that the statue was perfectly true to life, since "its



back was turned toward the church"; to which a reply was made



that "Grotius's face in the statue, like his living face, was



steadily turned toward justice." This latter remark had reference



to the fact that a court is held in the city hall, toward which



the statue is turned.







In the evening to a dinner given by Mr. Piersoon, minister of



finance and prime minister of the Netherlands, to our delegation



and to his colleagues of the Dutch ministry. Everything passed



off well, Mr. Piersoon proposing a toast to the health of the



President of the United States, to which I replied in a toast to



the Queen of the Netherlands. In the course of his speech Mr.



Piersoon thanked us for our tribute to Grotius, and showed really



deep feeling on the subject. There is no doubt that we have



struck a responsive chord in the hearts of all liberal and



thoughtful men and women of the Netherlands; from every quarter



come evidences of this.







A remark of his, regarding arbitration, especially pleased us. He



said that the arbitration plan, as it had come from the great



committee, was like a baby:--apparently helpless, and of very



little value, unable to do much, and requiring careful nursing;



but that it had one great merit:--IT WOULD GROW.







This I believe to be a very accurate statement of the situation.



The general feeling of the conference becomes better and better.



More and more the old skepticism has departed, and in place of it



has come a strong ambition to have a share in what we are



beginning to believe may be a most honorable contribution to the



peace of the world. I have never taken part in more earnest



discussions than those which during the last two weeks have



occupied us, and especially those relating to arbitration.







I think I may say, without assuming too much, that our Grotius



celebration has been a contribution of some value to this growth



of earnestness. It has, if I am not greatly mistaken, revealed to



the conference, still more clearly than before, the fact that it



is a historical body intrusted with a matter of vast importance



and difficulty, and that we shall be judged in history with



reference to this fact.











July 6.







At 5.30 P.M. off in special train with the entire conference to



Amsterdam. On arriving, we found a long train of court carriages



which took us to the palace, the houses on each side throughout



the entire distance being decorated with flags and banners, and



the streets crowded with men, women, and children. We were indeed



a brave show, since all of us, except the members of our American



delegation, wore gorgeous uniforms with no end of ribbons, stars,



and insignia of various offices and orders.







On reaching our destination, we were received by the Queen and



Queen-mother, and shortly afterward went in to dinner. With the



possible exception of a lord mayor's feast at the Guildhall, it



was the most imposing thing of the kind that I have ever seen.



The great banqueting-hall, dating from the glorious days of the



Dutch Republic, is probably the largest and most sumptuous in



continental Europe, and the table furniture, decorations, and



dinner were worthy of it. About two hundred and fifty persons,



including all the members of the conference and the higher



officials of the kingdom, sat down, the Queen and Queen-mother at



the head of the table, and about them the ambassadors and



presidents of delegations. My own place, being very near the



Majesties, gave me an excellent opportunity to see and hear



everything. Toward the close of the banquet the young Queen arose



and addressed us, so easily and naturally that I should have



supposed her speech extemporaneous had I not seen her consulting



her manuscript just before rising. Her manner was perfect, and



her voice so clear as to be heard by every one in the hall.



Everything considered, it was a remarkable effort for a young



lady of seventeen. At its close an excellent reply was made by



our president, M. de Staal; and soon afterward, when we had



passed into the great gallery, there came an even more striking



exhibition of the powers of her youthful Majesty, for she



conversed with every member of the conference, and with the



utmost ease and simplicity. To me she returned thanks for the



Grotius tribute, and in very cordial terms, as did later also the



Queen-mother; and I cannot but believe that they were sincere,



since, three months later, at the festival given them at Potsdam,



they both renewed their acknowledgments in a cordial way which



showed that their patriotic hearts were pleased. Various leading



men of the Netherlands and of the conference also thanked us, and



one of them said, "You Americans have taught us a lesson; for,



instead of a mere display of fireworks to the rabble of a single



city, or a ball or concert to a few officials, you have, in this



solemn recognition of Grotius, paid the highest compliment



possible to the entire people of the Netherlands, past, present,



and to come."











July 7.







In the morning to the great hall of the "House in the Wood,"



where the "editing committee" (comite de redaction) reported to



the third committee of the conference the whole arbitration plan.



It struck me most favorably, --indeed, it surprised me, though I



have kept watch of every step. I am convinced that it is better



than any of the plans originally submitted, not excepting our



own. It will certainly be a gain to the world.







At the close of the session we adjourned until Monday, the 17th,



in order that the delegates may get instructions from their



various governments regarding the signing of the protocols,



agreements, etc.











July 8.







In the evening dined with M. de Mier, the Mexican minister at



Paris and delegate here, and had a very interesting talk with M.



Raffalovitch, to whom I spoke plainly regarding the only road to



disarmament. I told him that he must know as well as any one that



there is a vague dread throughout Europe of the enormous growth



of Russia, and that he must acknowledge that, whether just or



not, it is perfectly natural. He acquiesced in this, and I then



went on to say that the Emperor Nicholas had before him an



opportunity to do more good and make a nobler reputation than any



other czar had ever done, not excepting Alexander II with his



emancipation of the serfs; that I had thought very seriously of



writing, at the close of the conference, to M. Pobedonostzeff,



presenting to him the reasons why Russia might well make a



practical beginning of disarmament by dismissing to their homes,



or placing on public works, say two hundred thousand of her



soldiers; that this would leave her all the soldiers she needs,



and more; that he must know, as everybody knows, that no other



power dreams of attacking Russia or dares to do so; that there



would be no disadvantage in such a dismissal of troops to



peaceful avocations, but every advantage; and that if it were



done the result would be that, in less than forty years, Russia



would become, by this husbanding of her resources, the most



powerful nation on the eastern continent, and able to carry out



any just policy which she might desire. I might have added that



one advantage of such a reduction would certainly be less



inclination by the war party at St. Petersburg to plunge into



military adventures. (Had Russia thus reduced her army she would



never have sunk into the condition in which she finds herself now



(1905), as I revise these lines. Instead of sending Alexeieff to



make war, she would have allowed De Witte to make peace--peace on



a basis of justice to Japan, and a winter access to the Pacific,



under proper safeguards, for herself.)







Raffalovitch seemed to acquiesce fully in my view, except as to



the number of soldiers to be released, saying that fifty or sixty



thousand would do perfectly well as showing that Russia is in



earnest.







He is one of the younger men of Russia, but has very decided



ability, and this he has shown not only in his secretaryship of



the conference, but in several of his works on financial and



other public questions published in Paris, which have secured for



him a corresponding membership of the French Institute.







It is absolutely clear in my mind that, if anything is to be done



toward disarmament, a practical beginning must be made by the



Czar; but the unfortunate thing is that with, no doubt, fairly



good intentions, he is weak and ill informed. The dreadful



mistake he is making in violating the oath sworn by his



predecessors and himself to Finland is the result of this



weakness and ignorance; and should he attempt to diminish his



overgrown army he would, in all probability, be overborne by the



military people about him, and by petty difficulties which they



would suggest, or, if necessary, create. It must be confessed



that there is one danger in any attempted disarmament, and this



is that the military clique might, to prevent it, plunge the



empire into a war.







The Emperor is surrounded mainly by inferior men. Under the shade



of autocracy men of independent strength rarely flourish. Indeed,



I find that the opinion regarding Russian statesmen which I



formed in Russia is confirmed by old diplomatists, of the best



judgment, whom I meet here. One of them said to me the other day:



"There is no greater twaddle than all the talk about far-seeing



purposes and measures by Russian statesmen. They are generally



weak, influenced by minor, and especially by personal,



considerations, and inferior to most men in similar positions in



the other great governments of Europe. The chancellor, Prince



Gortchakoff, of whom so much has been said, was a weak, vain man,



whom Bismarck found it generally very easy to deal with."







As to my own experience, I think many of those whom I saw were



far from the best of their kind with whom I have had to do. I



have never imagined a human being in the position of minister of



the interior of a great nation so utterly futile as the person



who held that place at St. Petersburg in my time; and the same



may be said of several others whom I met there in high places.



There are a few strong men, and, unfortunately, Pobedonostzeff is



one of them. Luckily, De Witte, the minister of finance, is



another.







July 10.







The evil which I dreaded, as regards the formation of public



opinion in relation to the work of our conference, is becoming



realized. The London "Spectator," just received, contains a most



disheartening article, "The Peace Conference a Failure," with an



additional article, more fully developed, to the same effect.



Nothing could be more unjust; but, on account of the



"Spectator's" "moderation," it will greatly influence public



opinion, and doubtless prevent, to some extent, the calling of



future conferences needed to develop the good work done in this.



Fortunately the correspondent of the "Times" gives a better



example, and shows, in his excellent letters, what has been



accomplished here. The "New York Herald," also, is thus far



taking the right view, and maintaining it with some earnestness.











July 17.







This morning, at ten, to the "House in the Wood" to hear Mr. van



Karnebeek's report on disarmament, checking invention, etc.,



before the session of committee No. 1. It was strongly attacked,



and was left in shreds: the whole subject is evidently too



immature and complicated to be dealt with during the present



conference.







In the afternoon came up an especially interesting matter in the



session of the arbitration committee, the occasion being a report



of the subcommittee. Among the points which most interested us as



Americans was a provision for an appeal from the decision of the



arbitration tribunal on the discovery of new facts.







De Martens of Russia spoke with great force against such right of



appeal, and others took ground with him. Holls really



distinguished himself by a telling speech on the other



side--which is the American side, that feature having been



present in our original instructions; Messrs. Asser and Karnebeek



both spoke for it effectively, and the final decision was



virtually in our favor, for Mr. Asser's compromise was adopted,



which really gives us the case.







The Siamese representatives requested that the time during which



an appeal might be allowed should be six instead of three months,



which we had named; but it was finally made a matter of



adjustment between the parties.











July 18.







The American delegation met at ten, when a cable message from the



State Department was read authorizing us to sign the protocol.











July 19.







Field day in the arbitration committee. A decided sensation was



produced by vigorous speeches by my Berlin colleague, Beldiman,



of the Roumanian delegation, and by Servian, Greek, and other



delegates, against the provision for commissions d'enquete,--De



Martens, Descamps, and others making vigorous speeches in behalf



of them. It looked as if the Balkan states were likely to



withdraw from the conference if the commission d'enquete feature



was insisted upon: they are evidently afraid that such "examining



commissions" may be sent within their boundaries by some of their



big neighbors--Russia, for example--to spy out the land and start



intrigues. The whole matter was put over.







In the evening to Count Munster's dinner at Scheveningen, and had



a very interesting talk on conference matters with Sir Julian



Pauncefote, finding that in most things we shall be able to stand



together as the crisis approaches.











July 20.







For several days past I have been preparing a possible speech to



be made in signing the protocol, etc., which, if not used for



that purpose, may be published, and, perhaps, aid in keeping



public opinion in the right line as regards the work of the



conference after it has closed.







In the afternoon to the "House in the Wood," the committee on



arbitration meeting again. More speeches were made by the



Bulgarians and Servians, who are still up in arms, fearing that



the commissionn d'enquete means intervention by the great states



in their affairs. Speeches to allay their fears were made by



Count Nigra, Dr. Zorn, Holls, and Leon Bourgeois. Zorn spoke in



German with excellent effect, as did Holls in English; Nigra was



really impressive; and Bourgeois, from the chair, gave us a



specimen of first-rate French oratory. He made a most earnest



appeal to the delegates of the Balkan states, showing them that



by such a system of arbitration as is now proposed the lesser



powers would be the very first to profit, and he appealed to



their loyalty to humanity. The speech was greatly and justly



applauded.







The Balkan delegates are gradually and gracefully yielding.











July 21.







In the morning to the "House in the Wood," where a plenary



session of the conference was held. It was a field day on



explosive, flattening and expanding bullets, etc. Our Captain



Crozier, who evidently knows more about the subject than anybody



else here, urged a declaration of the principle that balls should



be not more deadly or cruel than is absolutely necessary to put



soldiers hors de combat; but the committee had reported a



resolution which, Crozier insists, opens the door to worse



missiles than those at present used. Many and earnest speeches



were made. I made a short speech, moving to refer the matter back



to the committee, with instructions to harmonize and combine the



two ideas in one article--that is, the idea which the article now



expresses, and Crozier's idea of stating the general principle to



which the bullets should conform--namely, that of not making a



wound more cruel than necessary; but the amendment was lost.







July 22.







Sir Julian Pauncefote called to discuss with us the signing of



the Acte Final. There seems to be general doubt as to what is the



best manner of signing the conventions, declarations, etc., and



all remains in the air.







In the morning the American delegation met and Captain Mahan



threw in a bomb regarding article 27, which requires that when



any two parties to the conference are drifting into war, the



other powers should consider it a duty (devoir) to remind them of



the arbitration tribunal, etc. He thinks that this infringes the



American doctrine of not entangling ourselves in the affairs of



foreign states, and will prevent the ratification of the



convention by the United States Senate. This aroused earnest



debate, Captain Mahan insisting upon the omission of the word



"devoir," and Dr. Holls defending the article as reported by the



subcommittee, of which he is a member, and contending that the



peculiar interests of America could be protected by a



reservation. Finally, the delegation voted to insist upon the



insertion of the qualifying words, "autant que les circonstances



permettent," but this decision was afterward abandoned.











July 23.







Met at our Minister Newel's supper Sir Henry Howard, who told me



that the present Dutch ministry, with Piersoon at its head and De



Beaufort as minister of foreign affairs, is in a very bad way;



that its "subserviency to Italy," in opposition to the demands of



the Vatican for admittance into the conference, and its



difficulties with the socialists and others, arising from the



police measures taken against Armenian, Finnish, New Turkish, and



other orators who have wished to come here and make the



conference and the city a bear-garden , have led both the extreme



parties--that is, the solid Roman Catholic party on one side, and



the pretended votaries of liberty on the other--to hate the



ministry equally. He thinks that they will join hands and oust



the ministry just as soon as the conference is over.







Some allowance is to be made for the fact that Sir Henry is a



Roman Catholic: while generally liberal, he evidently looks at



many questions from the point of view of his church.[9]











[9] As it turned out, he was right: the ministry was ousted, but



not so soon as he expected, for the catastrophe did not arrive



until about two years later. Then came in a coalition of high



Calvinists and Roman Catholics which brought in the Kuyper



ministry.











July 24.







For some days--in fact, ever since Captain Mahan on the 22d



called attention to article 27 of the arbitration convention as



likely to be considered an infringement of the Monroe



Doctrine--our American delegation has been greatly perplexed. We



have been trying to induce the French, who proposed article 27,



and who are as much attached to it as is a hen to her one chick,



to give it up, or, at least, to allow a limiting or explanatory



clause to be placed with it. Various clauses of this sort have



been proposed. The article itself makes it the duty of the other



signatory powers, when any two nations are evidently drifting



toward war, to remind these two nations that the arbitration



tribunal is open to them. Nothing can be more simple and natural;



but we fear lest, when the convention comes up for ratification



in the United States Senate, some over-sensitive patriot may seek



to defeat it by insisting that it is really a violation of



time-honored American policy at home and abroad--the policy of



not entangling ourselves in the affairs of foreign nations, on



one side, and of not allowing them to interfere in our affairs,



on the other.







At twelve this day our delegation gave a large luncheon at the



Oude Doelen--among those present being Ambassadors De Staal,



Count Nigra, and Sir Julian Pauncefote, Bourgeois, Karnebeek,



Basily, Baron d'Estournelles, Baron de Bildt, and others--to



discuss means of getting out of the above-mentioned difficulty. A



most earnest effort was made to induce the French to allow some



such modification as has been put into other articles--namely,



the words, "autant que possible," or some limiting clause to the



same effect; but neither Bourgeois nor D'Estournelles,



representing France, would think of it for a moment. Bourgeois,



as the head of the French delegation, spoke again and again, at



great length. Among other things, he gave us a very long



disquisition on the meaning of "devoir" as it stands in the



article--a disquisition which showed that the Jesuits are not the



only skilful casuists in the world.







I then presented my project of a declaration of the American



doctrine to be made by us on signing. It had been scratched off



with a pencil in the morning, hastily; but it was well received



by Bourgeois, D'Estournelles, and all the others.







Later we held a meeting of our own delegation, when, to my



project of a declaration stating that nothing contained in any



part of the convention signed here should be considered as



requiring us to intrude, mingle, or entangle ourselves in



European politics or internal affairs, Low made an excellent



addition to the effect that nothing should be considered to



require any abandonment of the traditional attitude of the United



States toward questions purely American; and, with slight verbal



changes, this combination was adopted.











July 25.







All night long I have been tossing about in my bed and thinking



of our declaration of the Monroe Doctrine to be brought before



the conference to-day. We all fear that the conference will not



receive it, or will insist on our signing without it or not



signing at all.







On my way to The Hague from Scheveningen I met M. Descamps, the



eminent professor of international law in the University of



Louvain, and the leading delegate in the conference as regards



intricate legal questions connected with the arbitration plan. He



thought that our best way out of the difficulty was absolutely to



insist on a clause limiting the devoir imposed by article 27, and



to force it to a vote. He declared that, in spite of the French,



it would certainly be carried. This I doubt. M. Descamps knows,



perhaps, more of international law than of the temper of his



associates.







In the afternoon to the "House in the Wood," where the "Final



Act" was read. This is a statement of what has been done, summed



up in the form of three conventions, with sundry declarations,



voeux, etc. We had taken pains to see a number of the leading



delegates, and all, in their anxiety to save the main features of



the arbitration plan, agreed that they would not oppose our



declaration. It was therefore placed in the hands of



Raffalovitch, the Russian secretary, who stood close beside the



president, and as soon as the "Final Act" had been recited he



read this declaration of ours. This was then brought before the



conference in plenary session by M. de Staal, and the conference



was asked whether any one bad any objection, or anything to say



regarding it. There was a pause of about a minute, which seemed



to me about an hour. Not a word was said,--in fact, there was



dead silence,--and so our declaration embodying a reservation in



favor of the Monroe Doctrine was duly recorded and became part of



the proceedings.







Rarely in my life have I had such a feeling of deep relief; for,



during some days past, it has looked as if the arbitration



project, so far as the United States is concerned, would be



wrecked on that wretched little article 27.







I had before me notes of a speech carefully prepared, stating our



reasons and replying to objections, to be used in case we were



attacked, but it was not needed. In the evening I was asked by



Mr. Lavino, the correspondent of the London "Times," to put the



gist of it into an "interview" for the great newspaper which he



serves, and to this I consented; for, during the proceedings this



afternoon in the conference, Sir Julian Pauncefote showed great



uneasiness. He was very anxious that we should withdraw the



declaration altogether, and said, "It will be charged against you



that you propose to evade your duties while using the treaty to



promote your interests"; but I held firm and pressed the matter,



with the result above stated. I feared that he would object in



open conference; but his loyalty to arbitration evidently



deterred him. However, he returned to the charge privately, and I



then promised to make a public statement of our reasons for the



declaration, and this seemed to ease his mind. The result was a



recasting of my proposed speech, and this Mr. Lavino threw into



the form of a long telegram to the "Times."











July 26.







At ten to a meeting of our American delegation, when another



bombshell was thrown among us--nothing less than the question



whether the Pope is to be allowed to become one of the signatory



powers; and this question has now taken a very acute form. Italy



is, of course, utterly opposed to it, and Great Britain will not



sign if any besides those agreed upon by the signatory powers are



allowed to come in hereafter, her motive being, no doubt, to



avoid trouble in regard to the Transvaal.







Mr. Low stated that in the great committee the prevailing opinion



seemed to be that the signatory powers had made a sort of



partnership, and that no new partners could be added without the



consent of all. This is the natural ground, and entirely tenable.







I would have been glad to add the additional requirement that no



power should be admitted which would not make arbitration



reciprocal--that is, no power which, while aiding to arbitrate



for others, would not accept arbitration between itself and



another power. This would, of course, exclude the Vatican; for,



while it desires to judge others, it will allow no interests of



its own, not even the most worldly and trivial, to be submitted



to any earthly tribunal.







The question now came up in our American delegation as to signing



the three conventions in the Acte Final--namely, those relating



to arbitration, to the extension of the Geneva rules, and to the



laws and customs of war. We voted to sign the first, to send the



second to Washington without recommendation, and to send the



third with a recommendation that it be there signed. The reason



for sending the second to Washington without recommendation is



that Captain Mahan feels that, in its present condition, it may



bring on worse evils than it prevents. He especially and, I



think, justly objects to allowing neutral hospital ships to take



on board the wounded and shipwrecked in a naval action, with



power to throw around them the safeguards of neutrality and carry



them off to a neutral port whence they can again regain their own



homes and resume their status as combatants.







The reason for submitting the third to Washington, with a



recommendation to sign it there, is that considerable work will



be required in conforming our laws of war to the standard



proposed by the conference, and that it is best that the



Washington authorities look it over carefully.







I was very anxious to sign all three conventions, but the first



is the great one, and I yielded my views on the last two.







The powers are to have until the 31st of December, if they wish



it, before signing.











July 27.







Early in the morning to a meeting of our American delegation, Mr.



van Karnebeek being present. We agreed to sign the arbitration



convention, attaching to our signatures a reservation embodying



our declaration of July 25 regarding the maintenance of our



American policy--the Monroe Doctrine. A telegram was received



from the State Department approving of this declaration. The



imbroglio regarding the forcing of the Pope into the midst of the



signatory powers continues. The ultramontanes are pushing on



various delegates, especially sundry Austrians and Belgians, who



depend on clerical support for their political existence, and, in



some cases, for their daily bread; and the result is that M.



Descamps, one of the most eminent international lawyers in



Europe, who has rendered great services during the conference,



but who holds a professorship at the University of Louvain, and



can hold it not one moment longer than the Jesuits allow him, is



making a great display of feeling on the subject. Italy, of



course, continues to take the strongest ground against the



proposal to admit his Holiness as an Italian sovereign.







Our position is, as was well stated in the great committee by Mr.



Low, that the contracting parties must all consent before a new



party can come in; and this under one of the simplest principles



of law. We ought also to add that any power thus admitted shall



not only consent to arbitrate on others, but to be arbitrated



upon. This, of course, the Vatican monsignori will never do. They



would see all Europe deluged in blood before they would submit



the pettiest question between the kingdom of Italy and themselves



to arbitration by lay powers. All other things are held by them



utterly subordinate to the restoration of the Pope's temporal



power, though they must know that if it were restored to him



to-morrow he could not hold it. He would be overthrown by a



revolution within a month, even with all the troops which France



or Austria could send to support him; and then we should have the



old miserable state of things again in Italy, with bloodshed,



oppression, and exactions such as took place throughout the first



half of this century, and, indeed, while I was in Italy, under



the old papal authority, in 1856.







In the afternoon to the "House in the Wood" to go over documents



preliminary to signing the "Final Act."











July 28.







In the afternoon in plenary session of the conference, hearing



the final reports as to forms of signing, etc.







To-day appears in the London "Times" the interview which its



correspondent had with me yesterday. It develops the reasons for



our declaration, and seems to give general satisfaction. Sir



Julian Pauncefote told Holls that he liked it much.







The committee on forms of the "Final Act," etc., has at last,



under pressure of all sorts, agreed that the question of



admitting non-signatory powers shall be decided by the signatory



powers, hereafter, through the ordinary medium of diplomatic



correspondence. This is unfortunate for some of the South



American republics, but it will probably in some way inure to the



benefit of the Vatican monsignori.











July 29.







The last and culminating day of the conference.







In the morning the entire body gathered in the great hall of the



"House in the Wood," and each delegation was summoned thence to



sign the protocol, conventions, and declarations. These were laid



out on a long table in the dining-room of the palace, which is



adorned with very remarkable paintings of mythological subjects



imitating bas-reliefs.







All these documents had the places for each signature prepared



beforehand, and our seals, in wax, already placed upon the pages



adjoining the place where each signature was to be. At the



request of the Foreign Office authorities for my seal, I had sent



a day or two beforehand the seal ring which Goldwin Smith gave me



at the founding of Cornell University. It is an ancient carnelian



intaglio which he obtained in Rome, and bears upon its face,



exquisitely engraved, a Winged Victory. This seal I used during



my entire connection with Cornell University, and also as a



member of the Electoral College of the State of New York at



General Grant's second election, when, at the request of the



president of that body, Governor Woodford, it was used in sealing



certificates of the election, which were sent, according to law,



to certain high officials of our government.







I affixed my signature to the arbitration convention, writing in,



as agreed, the proviso that our signatures were subject to the



Monroe Doctrine declaration made in open session of the



conference on July 25. The other members of the American



delegation then signed in proper order. But the two other



conventions we left unsigned. It was with deep regret that I



turned away from these; but the majority of the delegation had



decreed it, and it was difficult to see what other course we



could pursue. I trust that the Washington authorities will



rectify the matter by signing them both.







We also affixed our signatures to the first of the



"declarations."







At three P.M. came the formal closing of the conference. M. de



Staal made an excellent speech, as did Mr. van Karnebeek and M.



de Beaufort, the Netherlands minister of foreign affairs. To



these Count Munster, the presiding delegate from Germany, replied



in French, and apparently extemporaneously. It must have been



pain and grief to him, for he was obliged to speak respectfully,



in the first place, of the conference, which for some weeks he



had affected to despise; and, secondly, of arbitration and the



other measures proposed, which, at least during all the first



part of the conference, he had denounced as a trick and a humbug;



and, finally, he had to speak respectfully of M. de Staal, to



whom he has steadily shown decided dislike. He did the whole



quite well, all things considered; but showed his feelings



clearly, as regarded M. de Staal, by adding to praise of him



greater praise for Mr. van Karnebeek, who has been the main



managing man in the conference in behalf of the Netherlands



Government.







Then to the hotel and began work on the draft of a report,



regarding the whole work of the conference, to the State



Department. I was especially embarrassed by the fact that the



wording of it must be suited to the scruples of my colleague,



Captain Mahan. He is a man of the highest character and of great



ability, whom I respect and greatly like; but, as an old naval



officer, wedded to the views generally entertained by older



members of the naval and military service, he has had very



little, if any, sympathy with the main purposes of the



conference, and has not hesitated to declare his disbelief in



some of the measures which we were especially instructed to



press. In his books he is on record against the immunity of



private property at sea, and in drawing up our memorial to the



conference regarding this latter matter, in making my speech with



reference to it in the conference, and in preparing our report to



the State Department, I have been embarrassed by this fact. It



was important to have unanimity, and it could not be had, so far



as he was concerned, without toning down the whole thing, and,



indeed, leaving out much that in my judgment the documents



emanating from us on the subject ought to contain. So now, in



regard to arbitration, as well as the other measures finally



adopted, his feelings must be considered. Still, his views have



been an excellent tonic; they have effectively prevented any



lapse into sentimentality. When he speaks the millennium fades



and this stern, severe, actual world appears.







I worked until late at night, and then went to Scheveningen



almost in despair.











July 30.







Returned to The Hague early in the morning, and went on again



with the report, working steadily through the day upon it. For



the first time in my life I have thus made Sunday a day of work.



Although I have no conscientious scruples on the subject, it was



bred into me in my childhood and boyhood that Sunday should be



kept free from all manner of work; and so thoroughly was this



rule inculcated that I have borne it in mind ever since, often



resisting very pressing temptation to depart from it.







But to-day there was no alternative, and the whole time until



five o'clock in the afternoon was given to getting my draft



ready.







At five P.M. the American delegation came together, and, to my



surprise, received my report with every appearance of



satisfaction. Mr. Low indicated some places which, in his



opinion, needed modification; and to this I heartily agreed, for



they were generally places where I was myself in doubt.







My draft having thus been presented, I turned it over to Mr. Low,



who agreed to bring it to-morrow morning with such modifications,



omissions, and additions as seemed best to him. The old proverb,



" 'T is always darkest just before daylight," seems exemplified



in the affairs of to-day, since the kind reception given to my



draft of the report, and the satisfaction expressed regarding it,



form a most happy and unexpected sequel to my wretched distrust



regarding the whole matter last night.











July 31.







The American delegation met at eleven in the morning and



discussed my draft. Mr. Low's modifications and additions were



not many and were mainly good. But he omitted some things which I



would have preferred to retain: these being in the nature of a



plea in behalf of arbitration, or, rather, an exhibition of the



advantages which have been secured for it by the conference; but,



between his doubts and Captain Mahan's opposition, I did not care



to contest the matter, and several pages were left out.







At six in the afternoon came the last meeting of our delegation.



The reports, duly engrossed,--namely, the special reports, signed



by Captain Mahan and Captain Crozier, from the first and second



committees of the conference; the special report made by myself,



Mr. Low, and Dr. Holls as members of the third committee; and the



general report covering our whole work, drawn almost entirely by



me, but signed by all the members of the commission,--were



presented, re-read, and signed, after which the delegation



adjourned, sine die.











August 1.







After some little preliminary work on matters connected with the



winding up of our commission, went with my private secretary, Mr.



Vickery, to Amsterdam, visiting the old church, the palace, the



Zoological Gardens, etc. Thence to Gouda and saw the



stained-glass windows in the old church there, which I have so



long desired to study.











August 3.







At 8.30 left The Hague and went by rail, via Cologne and



Ehreinbreitstein, to Homburg, arriving in the evening.











August 5.







This morning resumed my duties as ambassador at Berlin.







There was one proceeding at the final meeting of the conference



which I have omitted, but which really ought to find a place in



this diary. Just before the final speeches, to the amazement of



all and almost to the stupefaction of many, the president, M. de



Staal, handed to the secretary, without comment, a paper which



the latter began to read. It turned out to be a correspondence



which had taken place, just before the conference, between the



Queen of the Netherlands and the Pope.







The Queen's letter--written, of course, by her ministers, in the



desire to placate the Catholic party, which holds the balance of



power in the Netherlands--dwelt most respectfully on the high



functions of his Holiness, etc., etc., indicating, if not saying,



that it was not the fault of her government that he was not



invited to join in the conference.







The answer from the Pope was a masterpiece of Vatican skill. In



it he referred to what he claimed was his natural position as a



peacemaker on earth, dwelling strongly on this point.







The reading of these papers was received in silence, and not a



word was publicly said afterward regarding them, though in



various quarters there was very deep feeling. It was felt that



the Dutch Government had taken this means of forestalling local



Dutch opposition, and that it was a purely local matter of



political partizanship that ought never to have been intruded



upon a conference of the whole world.







I had no feeling of this sort, for it seemed to me well enough



that the facts should be presented; but a leading representative



of one of the great Catholic powers, who drove home with us, was



of a different mind. This eminent diplomatist from one of the



strongest Catholic countries, and himself a Catholic, spoke in



substance as follows: "The Vatican has always been, and is



to-day, a storm-center. The Pope and his advisers have never



hesitated to urge on war, no matter how bloody, when the



slightest of their ordinary worldly purposes could be served by



it. The great religious wars of Europe were entirely stirred up



and egged on by them; and, as everybody knows, the Pope did



everything to prevent the signing of the treaty of Munster, which



put an end to the dreadful Thirty Years' War, even going so far



as to declare the oaths taken by the plenipotentiaries at that



congress of no effect.







"All through the middle ages and at the Renaissance period the



Popes kept Italy in turmoil and bloodshed for their own family



and territorial advantages, and they kept all Europe in turmoil,



for two centuries after the Reformation,--in fact, just as long



as they could,--in the wars of religion. They did everything they



could to stir up the war between Austria and Prussia in 1866,



thinking that Austria, a Catholic power, was sure to win; and



then everything possible to stir up the war of France against



Prussia in 1870 in order to accomplish the same purpose of



checking German Protestantism; and now they are doing all they



can to arouse hatred, even to deluge Italy in blood, in the vain



attempt to recover the temporal power, though they must know that



they could not hold it for any length of time even if they should



obtain it.







"They pretend to be anxious to 'save souls,' and especially to



love Poland and Ireland; but they have for years used those



countries as mere pawns in their game with Russia and Great



Britain, and would sell every Catholic soul they contain to the



Greek and English churches if they could thereby secure the



active aid of those two governments against Italy. They have



obliged the Italian youth to choose between patriotism and



Christianity, and the result is that the best of these have



become atheists. Their whole policy is based on stirring up



hatred and promoting conflicts from which they hope to draw



worldly advantage.







"In view of all this, one stands amazed at the cool statements of



the Vatican letter."







These were the words of an eminent Roman Catholic representative



of a Roman Catholic power, and to them I have nothing to add.







In looking back calmly over the proceedings of the conference, I



feel absolutely convinced that it has accomplished a great work



for the world.







The mere assembling of such a body for such a purpose was a



distinct gain; but vastly more important is the positive outcome



of its labors.







First of these is the plan of arbitration. It provides a court



definitely constituted; a place of meeting easily accessible; a



council for summoning it always in session; guarantees for



perfect independence; and a suitable procedure.







Closely connected with this is the provision for "international



commissions of inquiry," which cannot fail to do much in clearing



up issues likely to lead to war between nations. Thus we may



hope, when there is danger of war, for something better than that



which the world has hitherto heard--the clamor of interested



parties and the shrieks of sensation newspapers. The natural



result will be, as in the Venezuelan difficulty between the



United States and Great Britain, that when a commission of this



sort has been set at work to ascertain the facts, the howling of



partizans and screaming of sensation-mongers will cease, and the



finding of the commission be calmly awaited.







So, too, the plans adopted for mediation can hardly fail to aid



in keeping off war. The plans for "special mediation" and



"seconding powers," which emanated entirely from the American



delegation, and which were adopted unanimously by the great



committee and by the conference, seem likely to prove in some



cases an effective means of preventing hostilities, and even of



arresting them after they have begun. Had it been in operation



during our recent war with Spain, it would probably have closed



it immediately after the loss of Cervera's fleet, and would have



saved many lives and much treasure.







Secondly, the extension of the Geneva rules, hitherto adopted for



war on land, to war also on the sea is a distinct gain in the



cause of mercy.







Thirdly, the amelioration and more careful definition of the laws



of war must aid powerfully in that evolution of mercy and right



reason which has been going on for hundreds of years, and



especially since the great work of Grotius.







In addition to these gains may well be mentioned the



declarations, expressions of opinion, and utterance of wishes for



continued study and persevering effort to make the



instrumentalities of war less cruel and destructive.







It has been said not infrequently that the conference missed a



great opportunity when it made the resort to arbitration



voluntary and not obligatory. Such an objection can come only



from those who have never duly considered the problem concerned.



Obligatory arbitration between states is indeed possible in



various petty matters, but in many great matters absolutely



impossible. While a few nations were willing to accept it in



regard to these minor matters,--as, for example, postal or



monetary difficulties and the like,--not a single power was



willing to bind itself by a hard-and-fast rule to submit all



questions to it--and least of all the United States.







The reason is very simple: to do so would be to increase the



chances of war and to enlarge standing armies throughout the



world. Obligatory arbitration on all questions would enable any



power, at any moment, to bring before the tribunal any other



power against which it has, or thinks it has, a grievance. Greece



might thus summon Turkey; France might summon Germany; the



Papacy, Italy; England, Russia; China, Japan; Spain, the United



States, regarding matters in which the deepest of human



feelings--questions of religion, questions of race, questions



even of national existence--are concerned. To enforce the



decisions of a tribunal in such cases would require armies



compared to which those of the present day are a mere bagatelle,



and plunge the world into a sea of troubles compared to which



those now existing are as nothing. What has been done is to



provide a way, always ready and easily accessible, by which



nations can settle most of their difficulties with each other.



Hitherto, securing a court of arbitration has involved first the



education of public opinion in two nations; next, the action of



two national legislatures; then the making of a treaty; then the



careful selection of judges on both sides; then delays by the



jurists thus chosen in disposing of engagements and duties to



which they are already pledged-all these matters requiring much



labor and long time; and this just when speedy action is most



necessary to arrest the development of international anger. Under



the system of arbitration now presented, the court can be brought



into session at short notice--easily, as regards most nations,



within a few weeks, at the farthest. When to these advantages are



added the provisions for delaying war and for improving the laws



of war, the calm judgment of mankind will, I fully believe,



decide that the conference has done a work of value to the world.







There is also another gain--incidental, but of real and permanent



value; and this is the inevitable development of the Law of



Nations by the decisions of such a court of arbitration composed



of the most eminent jurists from all countries. Thus far it has



been evolved from the writings of scholars often conflicting,



from the decisions of national courts biased by local patriotism,



from the practices of various powers, on land and sea, more in



obedience to their interests than to their sense of justice; but



now we may hope for the growth of a great body of international



law under the best conditions possible, and ever more and more in



obedience to the great impulse given by Grotius in the direction



of right reason and mercy.















CHAPTER L







HINTS FOR REFORMS IN THE DIPLOMATIC SERVICE







In view of a connection with the diplomatic service of the United



States begun nearly fifty years ago and resumed at various posts



and periods since, I have frequently been asked for my opinion of



it, as compared with that of other nations, and also what



measures I would suggest for its improvement. Hitherto this



question has somewhat embarrassed me: answering it fully might



have seemed to involve a plea for my own interests; so that,



while I have pointed out, in public lectures and in letters to



men of influence, sundry improvements, I have not hitherto



thought it best to go fully into the subject.







But what I now say will not see the light until my diplomatic



career is finished forever, and I may claim to speak now for what



seems to me the good of the service and of the country. I shall



make neither personal complaint of the past nor personal plea for



the future. As to the past, my experience showed me years ago



what I had to expect if I continued in the service--insufficient



salary, unfit quarters, inadequate means of discharging my



duties, and many other difficulties which ought not to have



existed, but which I knew to exist when I took office, and of



which I have therefore no right to complain. As to the future, I



can speak all the more clearly and earnestly because even my



enemies, if I have any, must confess that nothing which is now to



be done can inure to my personal benefit.







As to the present condition, then, of our diplomatic service, it



seems to me a mixture of good and evil. It is by no means so bad



as it once was, and by no means so good as it ought to be and as



it could very easily be made. There has been great improvement in



it since the days of the Civil War. The diplomatic service of no



other country, probably, was so disfigured by eminently unworthy



members as was our own during the quarter of a century preceding



the inauguration of President Lincoln, and, indeed, during a part



of the Lincoln administration itself.







During one presidential term previous to that time our ministers



at three of the most important centers of Europe were making



unedifying spectacles of themselves, whenever it was possible for



them to do so, before the courts to which they were accredited.



On one occasion of court festivity, one of them, in a gorgeous



uniform such as American ministers formerly wore, ran howling



through the mud in the streets of St. Petersburg, the high



personages of the empire looking out upon him from the windows of



the Winter Palace. Sundry other performances of his, to which I



have referred in the account of my Russian mission, were quite as



discreditable.







Another American representative, stationed at Berlin during that



same period, disgraced his country by notorious drunkenness; and



though some of our countrymen at that capital sought to keep him



sober for his first presentation to the King, they were



unsuccessful. Happily, his wild conduct did not culminate abroad;



for a murder which he committed in a drunken fit did not occur



until after his return to our country. A third American



representative at that period published regularly, in his home



newspaper, such scurrilous letters regarding the authorities of



the country to which he was accredited, his colleagues in the



diplomatic service, and, indeed, the country itself, that,



according to common report, his early return home was caused by



his desire to escape the consequences. These were the worst, but



there were others utterly unfit,--men who not only spoke no other



language used in diplomatic intercourse, but could not even speak



with fairly grammatical decency their own. As to the early days



of Mr. Lincoln's administration, there is a well-authenticated



story that, a gentleman having expostulated with the Secretary of



State, Mr. Seward, for sending to a very important diplomatic



post a man whose conduct was the reverse of exemplary, Mr. Seward



replied, "Sir, some persons are sent abroad because they are



needed abroad, and some are sent because they are NOT wanted at



home."







It is a great pleasure to note that since the war both of the



political parties have greatly improved in this respect, and that



the standard of diplomatic appointments has become much higher.



It is a duty as well as a pleasure to acknowledge here that no



President of the United States has ever taken more pains to make



the diplomatic and consular services what they should be than a



representative of the party to which I have always been



opposed--President Cleveland. Especially encouraging is the fact



that public opinion has become sensitive on this subject, and



that the only recent case of gross misconduct by an American



minister in foreign parts was immediately followed by his recall.







And it ought also to be said, even regarding our diplomatic



system in the past, that sundry sneers of the pessimists do our



country wrong. It is certain that no other country has been



steadily represented in Great Britain by a series of more



distinguished citizens than has our own,--beginning with John



Adams, and including the gentleman who at present holds the



position of ambassador to the Court of St. James. Much may also



be said to the credit of our embassies and legations generally at



the leading capitals of Europe. As to unfortunate exceptions,



those who are acquainted with diplomatists in different parts of



the world know that, whatever may have been the failings of the



United States in this respect, she has not been the only nation



which has made mistakes in selecting foreign representatives.







Our service at the present day is, in some respects, excellent;



but it is badly organized, insufficiently provided for, and, as a



rule, has not the standing which every patriotic American should



wish for it.







I have frequently received letters from bright, active-minded



young men stating that they were desirous of fitting themselves



for a diplomatic career, and asking advice regarding the best way



of doing so; but I have felt obliged to warn every one of them



that, strictly speaking, there is no American diplomatic service;



that there is no guarantee of employment to them, even if they



fit themselves admirably; no security in their tenure of office,



even if they were appointed; and little, if any, probability of



their promotion, however excellent their record. Moreover, I have



felt obliged to tell them that the service, such as it is,



especially as regards ambassadors and ministers, is a service



with a property qualification; that it is not a democratic



service resting upon merit, but an aristocratic service resting



largely upon wealth,--a very important--indeed,



essential--qualification for it being that any American who



serves as ambassador must, as a rule, be able to expend, in



addition to his salary, at least from twelve to twenty thousand



dollars a year, and that the demands upon ministers



plenipotentiary are but little less.







And yet, if Congress would seriously give attention to the



matter, calling before a proper committee those of its own



members, and others, who are well acquainted with the necessities



of the service, and would take common-sense advice, it could



easily be made one of the best, and quite possibly the best, in



the world. The most essential and desirable improvements which I



would present are as follows:







I. As regards the first and highest grade in the diplomatic



service, that of ambassadors, I would have at least one half



their whole number appointed from those who have distinguished



themselves as ministers plenipotentiary, and the remaining posts



filled, as at present, from those who, in public life or in other



important fields, have won recognition at home as men fit to



maintain the character and represent the interests of their



country abroad.







II. As regards the second grade in the service,--namely, that of



ministers plenipotentiary,--I would observe the same rule as in



appointing ambassadors, having at least a majority of these at



the leading capitals appointed from such as shall have especially



distinguished themselves at the less important capitals, and a



majority of the ministers plenipotentiary at these less important



capitals appointed from those who shall have distinguished



themselves as ministers resident, or as secretaries of embassy or



of legation.







III. As to the third grade in our service, that of ministers



resident, I would observe the general rule above suggested for



the appointment of ambassadors and ministers plenipotentiary;



that is, I would appoint a majority of them from among those who



shall have rendered most distinguished service as first



secretaries of embassy or of legation. When once appointed I



would have them advanced, for distinguished service, from the



less to the more important capitals, and, so far as possible,



from the ranks of ministers resident to those of ministers



plenipotentiary.







IV. As to the lower or special or temporary grades, whether that



of diplomatic agent or special charge d'affaires or commissioner,



I would have appointments made from the diplomatic or consular



service, or from public life in general, or from fitting men in



private life, as the President or the Secretary of State might



think the most conducive to the public interest.







V. I would have two grades of secretaries of legation, and three



grades of secretaries of embassy. I would have the lowest grade



of secretaries appointed on the recommendation of the Secretary



of State from those who have shown themselves, on due



examination, best qualified in certain leading subjects, such as



international law, the common law, the civil law, the history of



treaties, and general modern history, political economy, a



speaking knowledge of French, and a reading knowledge of at least



one other foreign language. I would make the examination in all



the above subjects strict, and would oblige the Secretary of



State to make his selection of secretaries of legation from the



men thus presented. But, in view of the importance of various



personal qualifications which fit men to influence their



fellow-men, and which cannot be ascertained wholly by



examination, I would leave the Secretary of State full liberty of



choice among those who have honorably passed the examinations



above required. The men thus selected and approved I would have



appointed as secretaries of lower grades,--that is, third



secretaries of embassy and second secretaries of legation,--and



these, when once appointed, should be promoted, for good service,



to the higher secretaryships of embassy and legation, and from



the less to the more important capitals, under such rules as the



State Department might find most conducive to the efficiency of



the service. No secretaries of any grade should thereafter be



appointed who had not passed the examinations required for the



lowest grade of secretaries as above provided; but all who had



already been in the service during two years should be eligible



for promotion, without any further examination, from whatever



post they might be occupying.







VI. I would attach to every embassy three secretaries, to every



legation two, and to every post of minister resident at least



one.







One of the thoroughly wise arrangements of every British embassy



or legation--an arrangement which has gone for much in Great



Britain's remarkable series of diplomatic successes throughout



the world--is to be seen in her maintaining at every capital a



full number of secretaries and attaches, who serve not only in



keeping the current office work in the highest efficiency, but



who become, as it were, the ANTENNAE of the ambassador or



minister--additional eyes and ears to ascertain what is going on



among those most influential in public affairs. Every embassy or



legation thus equipped serves also as an actual and practical



training-school for the service.







VII. I would appoint each attache from the ranks of those



especially recommended, and certified to in writing by leading



authorities in the department to which he is expected to supply



information: as, for example, for military attaches, the War



Department; for naval attaches, the Navy Department; for



financial attaches, the Treasury Department; for commercial



attaches, the Department of Commerce; for agricultural attaches,



the Department of Agriculture; but always subject to the approval



of the Secretary of State as regards sundry qualifications hinted



at above, which can better be ascertained by an interview than by



an examination.







I would have a goodly number of attaches of these various sorts,



and, in our more important embassies, one representing each of



the departments above named. Every attache, if fit for his place,



would be worth far more than his cost to our government, for he



would not only add to the influence of the embassy or legation,



but decidedly to its efficiency. As a rule, all of them could



also be made of real use after the conclusion of their foreign



careers: some by returning to the army or navy and bringing their



knowledge to bear on those branches of the service; some by



taking duty in the various departments at Washington, and aiding



to keep our government abreast of the best practice in other



countries; some by becoming professors in universities and



colleges, and thus aiding to disseminate useful information; some



by becoming writers for the press, thus giving us, instead of



loose guesses and haphazard notions, information and suggestions



based upon close knowledge of important problems and of their



solution in countries other than our own







From these arrangements I feel warranted in expecting a very



great improvement in our diplomatic service. Thus formed, it



would become, in its main features, like the military and naval



services, and, indeed, in its essential characteristics as to



appointment and promotion, like any well-organized manufacturing



or commercial establishment. It would absolutely require



ascertained knowledge and fitness in the lowest grades, and would



give promotion for good service from first to last. Yet it would



not be a cast-iron system: a certain number of men who had shown



decided fitness in various high public offices, or in important



branches of public or private business, could be appointed,



whenever the public interest should seem to require it, as



ministers resident, ministers plenipotentiary, and ambassadors,



without having gone through examination or regular promotion.







But the system now proposed, while thus allowing the frequent



bringing in of new and capable men from public life at home,



requires that a large proportion of each grade above that of



secretary, save a very small number of diplomatic agents,



commissioners, and the like, shall be appointed from those



thoroughly trained for the service, and that all secretaries,



without exception, shall be thoroughly trained and fitted. Scope



would thus be given to the activity of both sorts of men, and the



whole system made sufficiently elastic to meet all necessities.







In the service thus organized, the class of ambassadors and



ministers fitted by knowledge of public affairs at home for



important negotiations, but unacquainted with diplomatic life or



foreign usages and languages, would be greatly strengthened by



secretaries who had passed through a regular course of training



and experience. An American diplomatic representative without



diplomatic experience, on reaching his post, whether as



ambassador or minister, would not find--as was once largely the



case--secretaries as new as himself to diplomatic business, but



men thoroughly prepared to aid him in the multitude of minor



matters, ignorance of which might very likely cripple him as



regards very important business: secretaries so experienced as to



be able to set him in the way of knowing, at any court, who are



the men of real power, and who mere parasites and pretenders,



what relations are to be cultivated and what avoided, which are



the real channels of influence, and which mere illusions leading



nowhither. On the other hand, the secretaries thoroughly trained



would doubtless, in their conversation with a man fresh from



public affairs at home, learn many things of use to them.







Thus, too, what is of great importance throughout the entire



service, every ambassador, minister plenipotentiary, or minister



resident would possess, or easily command, large experience of



various men in various countries. At the same time, each would be



under most powerful incentives to perfect his training, widen his



acquaintance, and deepen his knowledge--incentives which, under



the old system,--which we may hope is now passing away,--with its



lack of appointment for ascertained fitness, lack of promotion



for good service, and lack of any certainty of tenure, do not



exist.







The system of promotion for merit throughout the service is no



mere experiment; the good sense of all the leading nations in the



world, except our own, has adopted it, and it works well. In our



own service the old system works badly; excellent men, both in



its higher and lower grades, have been frequently crippled by



want of proper experience or aid. We have, indeed, several



admirable secretaries--some of them fit to be ambassadors or



ministers, but all laboring under conditions the most depressing



--such as obtain in no good business enterprise. During my stay



as minister at St. Petersburg, the secretary of legation, a man



ideally fitted for the post, insisted on resigning. On my



endeavoring to retain him, he answered as follows: "I have been



over twelve years in the American diplomatic service as



secretary; I have seen the secretaries here, from all other



countries, steadily promoted until all of them still remaining in



the service are in higher posts, several of them ministers, and



some ambassadors. I remain as I was at the beginning, with no



promotion, and no probability of any. I feel that, as a rule, my



present colleagues, as well as most officials with whom I have to



do, seeing that I have not been advanced, look upon me as a



failure. They cannot be made to understand how a man who has



served so long as secretary has been denied promotion for any



reason save inefficiency. I can no longer submit to be thus



looked down upon, and I must resign."







While thus having a system of promotion based upon efficiency, I



would retain during good behavior, up to a certain age, the men



who have done thoroughly well in the service. Clearly, when we



secure an admirable man,--recognized as such in all parts of the



world,--like Mr. Wheaton, Mr. Bancroft, Mr. Charles Francis



Adams, Mr. Marsh, Mr. Townsend Harris, Mr. Washburne, Mr. Lowell,



Mr. Bayard, Mr. Phelps, and others who have now passed away, not



to speak of many now living, we should keep him at his post as



long as he is efficient, without regard to his politics. This is



the course taken very generally by other great nations, and



especially by our sister republic of Great Britain (for Great



Britain is simply a republic with a monarchical figurehead



lingering along on good behavior): she retains her



representatives in these positions, and promotes them without any



regard to their party relations. During my first official



residence at Berlin, although the home government at London was



of the Conservative party, it retained at the German capital, as



ambassador, Lord Ampthill, a Liberal; and, as first secretary,



Sir John Walsham, a Tory. From every point of view, the long



continuance in diplomatic positions of the most capable men would



be of great advantage to our country.







But, as the very first thing to be done, whether our diplomatic



service remains as at present or be improved, I would urge, as a



condition precedent to any thoroughly good service, that there be



in each of the greater capitals of the world at which we have a



representative, a suitable embassy or legation building or



apartment, owned or leased for a term of years by the American



Government Every other great power, and many of the smaller



nations, have provided such quarters for their representatives,



and some years ago President Cleveland recommended to Congress a



similar policy. Under the present system the head of an American



embassy or mission abroad is at a wretched disadvantage. In many



capitals he finds it at times impossible to secure a proper



furnished apartment; and, in some, very difficult to find any



suitable apartment at all, whether furnished or unfurnished. Even



if he finds proper rooms, they are frequently in an unfit quarter



of the town, remote from the residences of his colleagues, from



the public offices, from everybody and everything related to his



work. His term of office being generally short, he is usually



considered a rather undesirable tenant, and is charged



accordingly. Besides this, the fitting and furnishing of such an



apartment is a very great burden, both as regards trouble and



expense. I have twice thus fitted and furnished a large apartment



in Berlin, and in each case this represented an expenditure of



more than the salary for the first year. Within my own knowledge,



two American ministers abroad have impoverished their families by



expenditures of this kind. But this is not the worst. The most



serious result of the existing system concerns our country. I



have elsewhere shown how, in one very important international



question at St. Petersburg, our mistaken policy in this respect



once cost the United States a sum which would have forever put



that embassy, and, indeed, many others besides, on the very best



footing. If an American ambassador is to exercise a really strong



influence for the United States as against other nations he must



be properly provided for as regards his residence and



support,--not provided for, indeed, so largely as some



representatives of other nations; for I neither propose nor



desire that the American representative shall imitate the pomp of



certain ambassadors of the greater European powers. But he ought



to be enabled to live respectably, and to discharge his duties



efficiently. There should be, in this respect, what Thomas



Jefferson acknowledged in the Declaration of Independence as a



duty,--"a decent regard for the opinions of mankind." The present



condition of things is frequently humiliating. In the greater



capitals of Europe the general public know the British, French,



Austrian, Italian, and all other important embassies or



legations, except that of our country. The American embassy or



legation has no settled home, is sometimes in one quarter of the



town, sometimes in another, sometimes almost in an attic,



sometimes almost in a cellar, generally inadequate in its



accommodations, and frequently unfortunate in its surroundings.



Both my official terms at St. Petersburg showed me that one



secret of the great success of British diplomacy, in all parts of



the world, is that especial pains are taken regarding this point,



and that, consequently, every British embassy is the center of a



wide-spread social influence which counts for very much indeed in



her political influence. The United States, as perhaps the



wealthiest nation in existence,--a nation far-reaching in the



exercise of its foreign policy, with vast and increasing



commercial and other interests throughout the world,--should, in



all substantial matters, be equally well provided for. Take our



recent relations with Turkey. We have insisted on the payment of



an indemnity for the destruction of American property, and we



have constantly a vast number of Americans of the very best sort,



and especially our missionaries, who have to be protected



throughout the whole of that vast empire. Each of the other great



powers provides its representative at Constantinople with a



residence honorable, suitable, and within a proper inclosure for



its protection; but the American minister lives anywhere and



everywhere,--in such premises, over shops and warehouses, as can



be secured,--and he is liable, in case of trouble between the two



nations, to suffer personal violence and to have his house sacked



by a Turkish mob. No foreign people, and least of all an Oriental



people, can highly respect a diplomatic representative who, by



his surroundings, seems not to be respected by his own people.



The American Government can easily afford the expenditure needed



to provide proper houses or apartments for its entire diplomatic



corps, but it can hardly afford NOT to provide these. Full



provision for them would not burden any American citizen to the



amount of the half of a Boston biscuit. Leaving matters in their



present condition is, in the long run, far more costly. I once



had occasion to consider this matter in the light of economy, and



found that the cost of the whole diplomatic service of the United



States during an entire year was only equal to the expenditure in



one of our recent wars during four hours; so that if any member



of the diplomatic service should delay a declaration of war



merely for the space of a day, he would defray the cost of the



service for about six years.







Mr. Charles Francis Adams, by his admirable diplomatic dealing



with the British Foreign Office at the crisis of our Civil War,



prevented the coming out of the later Confederate cruisers to



prey upon our commerce, and, in all probability, thus averted a



quarrel with Great Britain which would have lengthened our Civil



War by many years, and doubtless have cost us hundreds of



millions.







General Woodford, our recent minister at Madrid, undoubtedly



delayed our war with Spain for several months, and skilful



diplomatic intervention brought that war to a speedy close just



as soon as our military and naval successes made it possible.







The cases are also many where our diplomatic representatives have



quieted ill feelings which would have done great harm to our



commerce. These facts show that the diplomatic service may well



be called "The Cheap Defense of Nations."







When, in addition to this, an American recalls such priceless



services to civilization, and to the commerce of our country and



of the world, as those rendered by Mr. Townsend Harris while



American minister in Japan, the undoubted saving through a long



series of years of many lives and much property by our ministers



in such outlying parts of the world as Turkey and China, the



promotion of American commercial and other interests, and the



securing of information which has been precious to innumerable



American enterprises, it seems incontestable that our diplomatic



service ought not to be left in its present slipshod condition.



It ought to be put on the best and most effective footing



possible, so that everywhere the men we send forth to support and



advance the manifold interests of our country shall be thoroughly



well equipped and provided for. To this end the permanent



possession of a suitable house or apartment in every capital is



the foremost and most elementary of necessities.







And while such a provision is the first thing, it would be wise



to add, as other nations do, a moderate allowance for furniture,



and for keeping the embassy or legation properly cared for during



the interim between the departure of one representative and the



arrival of another.







If this were done, the prestige of the American name and the



effectiveness of the service would be vastly improved, and



diplomatic posts would be no longer so onerous and, indeed,



ruinous as they have been to some of the best men we have sent



abroad.







And in order fully to free my mind I will add that, while the



provision for a proper embassy or legation building is the first



of all things necessary, it might also be well to increase



somewhat the salaries of our representatives abroad. These may



seem large even at present; but the cost of living has greatly



increased since they were fixed, and the special financial



demands upon an ambassador or minister at any of the most



important posts are always far beyond the present salary. It is



utterly impossible for an American diplomatic representative to



do his duty upon the salary now given, even while living on the



most moderate scale known in the diplomatic corps. To attempt to



do so would deprive him of all opportunity to exercise that



friendly, personal, social influence which is so important an



element in his success.







To sum up my suggestions as to this part of the subject, I should



say: First, that, as a rule, there should be provided at each



diplomatic post where the United States has a representative a



spacious and suitable house, either bought by our government or



taken on a long lease; and that there should be a small



appropriation each year for maintaining it as regards furniture,



care, etc. Secondly, that American representatives of the highest



grade--namely, ambassadors--should have a salary of at least



$25,000 a year; and that diplomatic representatives of lower



grade should have their salaries raised in the same proportion.



Thirdly, that an additional number of secretaries and attaches



should be provided in the manner and for the reasons above



recommended.







If the carrying out of these reforms should require an



appropriation to the diplomatic service fifty per cent. higher



than it now is,--which is an amount greater than would really be



required by all the expenditures I propose, including interest



upon the purchase money of appropriate quarters for our



representatives abroad,--the total additional cost to each



citizen of the United States would be less than half a cent each



year.







The first result of these and other reforms which I have



indicated, beginning with what is of the very first



importance,--provision for a proper house or apartment in every



capital,--would certainly be increased respect for the United



States and increased effectiveness of its foreign



representatives.







As to the other reforms, such as suitable requirements for



secretaryships, and proper promotion throughout the whole



service, they would vastly increase its attractiveness, in all



its grades, to the very men whom the country most needs. They



would open to young men in our universities and colleges a most



honorable career, leading such institutions to establish courses



of instruction with reference to such a service--courses which



were established long since in Germany, but which have arrived



nearest perfection in two of our sister republics--at the



University of Zurich in Switzerland, and in the ecole Libre des



Sciences Politiques in Paris.







It seems certain that a diplomatic service established and



maintained in the manner here indicated would not only vastly



increase the prestige and influence of the United States among



her sister nations, but, purely from a commercial point of view,



would amply repay us. To have in diplomatic positions at the



various capitals men thoroughly well fitted not only as regards



character and intellect, but also as regards experience and



acquaintance, and to have them so provided for as to become the



social equals of their colleagues, would be, from every point of



view, of the greatest advantage to our country materially and



politically, and would give strength to our policy throughout the



world.







And, finally, to a matter worth mentioning only because it has at



sundry times and in divers manners been comically argued and



curiously misrepresented--the question as to a diplomatic



uniform.







As regards any principle involved, I have never been able to see



any reason, a priori, why, if we have a uniform for our military



service and another for our naval service, we may not have one



for our diplomatic service. It has, indeed, been asserted by



sundry orators dear to the galleries, as well as by various



"funny-column" men, that such a uniform is that of a lackey; but



this assertion loses force when one reflects on the solemn fact



that "plain evening dress," which these partizans of Jeffersonian



simplicity laud and magnify, and which is the only alternative to



a uniform, is worn by table-waiters the world over.







Yet, having conceded so much, truth compels me to add that,



having myself never worn anything save "plain evening dress" at



any court to which I have been accredited, or at any function



which I have attended, I have never been able to discover the



slightest disadvantage to my country or myself from that fact.







Colleagues of mine, clad in resplendent uniforms, have, indeed,



on more than one occasion congratulated me on being allowed a



more simple and comfortable costume; and though such expressions



are, of course, to be taken with some grains of allowance, I have



congratulated myself with the deepest sincerity on my freedom



from what seems to me a most tiresome yoke.







The discussion of a question of such vast importance--to the



censors above referred to--would be inadequate were mention not



made of a stumbling-block which does not seem to have been



adequately considered by those who propose a return to the



earlier practice of our Republic --and this is, that the uniform



is, at any European court, but a poor thing unless it bears some



evidence of distinguished service, in the shape of stars,



crosses, ribbons, and the like. A British ambassador, or minister



plenipotentiary, in official uniform, but without the ribbon or



star of the Bath or other honorable order, would appear to little



advantage indeed. A representative of the French Republic would



certainly prefer to wear the plainest dress rather than the most



splendid uniform unadorned by the insignia of the Legion of



Honor, and, in a general way, the same may be said of the



representatives of all nations which approve the wearing of a



diplomatic uniform.







But our own Republic bestows no such "decorations," and allows



none of its representatives, during their term of office, to



receive them; so that, if put into uniform, these representatives



must appear to the great mass of beholders as really of inferior



quality, undistinguished by any adornments which indicate good



service.







All this difficulty our present practice avoids. The American



ambassador, or minister, is known at once by the fact that he



alone wears plain evening dress; and this fact, as well as the



absence of decorations, being recognized as in simple conformity



with the ideas and customs of his country, rather adds to his



prestige than diminishes it, as far as I have been able to



discover. Perhaps the well-known case of Lord Castlereagh at the



Congress of Vienna is in point. In the midst of the throng of his



colleagues, all of them most gorgeously arrayed in uniforms,



stars, and decorations of every sort, he appeared in the simplest



evening attire; and the attention of Metternich being called to



this fact, that much experienced, infinitely bespangled statesman



answered, "Ma foi! il est bien distingue."







Of course we ought to give due weight to the example set by



Benjamin Franklin when presented to Louis XVI, and the fact that



his simple shoe-strings nearly threw the court chamberlains into



fainting-fits, and that his plain dress had an enormous influence



on public opinion; but, alas! we have also to take account of the



statement by an eminent critic to the effect that Franklin, at



his previous presentation to Louis XV, had worn court dress, and



that he wore similar gorgeous attire at various other public



functions, with the inference that he was prevented from doing



so, when received by Louis XVI, only by the fact that somehow his



court dress was inaccessible.[10]











[10] See Sainte-Beuve, "Causeries du Lundi," Vol. VII, Article of



November 29, 1852.











All these facts, conflicting, but more or less pertinent, being



duly considered, I would have the rule regarding dress remain as



it is, save in the rare cases when the sovereign of a country, at



some special function, requests some modification of it. In such



case the Secretary of State might, one would suppose, be allowed



to grant a dispensation from the ordinary rule without any danger



to American liberty.







For the more profound considerations which this vast subject



suggests, the judicious reader may well consult "Sartor



Resartus."

















PART VI







SUNDRY JOURNEYS AND EXPERIENCES







CHAPTER LI







EARLIER EXCURSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES--1838-1875







From my boyhood I have been fond of travel, and at times this



fondness has been of great use to me. My constitution, though



never robust, has thus far proved elastic, and whenever I have at



last felt decidedly the worse for overwork or care, the best of



all medicines has been an excursion, longer or shorter, in our



own country or in some other. Thus it has happened that, besides



journeys into nearly every part of the United States, and



official residences in Russia, France, Germany, and the West



Indies, I have made frequent visits to Europe--among them ten or



twelve to Italy, and even more to Germany, France, and England,



besides excursions into the Scandinavian countries, Egypt,



Greece, and Turkey. To most of these I have alluded in other



chapters; but there are a few remaining possibly worthy of note.







The first of these journeys was taken when I went with my father



and mother from the little country town where we then lived to



Syracuse, Buffalo, and Niagara. This must have been in 1838, when



I was about six years of age. Every step of it interested me



keenly. Like the shop-girl in Emile Souvestre's story, who



journeyed from Paris to St. Cloud, I was "amazed to find the



world so large." Syracuse, which now has about one hundred and



twenty thousand inhabitants, had then, perhaps, five thousand;



the railways which were afterward consolidated into the New York



Central were not yet built, and we traveled mainly upon the



canal, though at times over wretchedly muddy roads. Niagara made



a great impression upon me, and Buffalo, with its steamers,



seemed as great then as London seems now.







Four years later, in 1842, I was taken to the hills of middle



Massachusetts to visit my great-grandfather and



great-grandmother, and thence to Boston, where Faneuil Hall, the



Bunker Hill Monument, Harvard College, and Mount Auburn greatly



impressed me. Returning home, we came by steamer through the



Sound to the city of New York, and stayed at a hotel near Trinity



Church, which was then a little south of the central part of the



city. On another visit, somewhat later, we were lodged at the



Astor House, near the City Hall, which was then at the very



center of everything, and thence took excursions far northward



into the uttermost parts of the city, and even beyond it, to see



the newly erected Grace Church and the reservoir at Forty-second



Street, which were among the wonders of the town. Most of all was



I impressed by the service in the newly erected Trinity Church.



The idea uppermost in my mind was that here was a building which



was to last for hundreds of years, and that the figures in the



storied windows above the altar would look down upon new



generations of worshipers, centuries after I, with all those



living, should have passed away. My feeling for religious music



was then, as since, very deep; and the organ of Trinity gave



satisfaction to this feeling; the tremulous ground-tone of the



great pedal diapasons thrilling me through and through.







At this period, about 1843, began my visits with the family to



Saratoga. My grandfather, years before, had derived benefit from



its waters, and the tradition of this, as well as the fact that



my father there met socially his business correspondents from



different parts of the State, led to our going year after year.



Drinking the waters, taking life easily upon the piazzas of the



great hotels festooned with Virginia creepers, and driving to the



lake, formed then, as now, the main occupations of the day. But



there was then one thing which has now ceased: in many of the



greater hotels public prayers were held every evening, some



eminent clergyman officiating; and a leader in these services was



David Leavitt, a famous New York bank president, shrewd, but



pious. Now and then, as the political campaigns drew on, we had



speeches from eminent statesmen; and I give in the chapters on



"My Religion" reminiscences of speeches on religious subjects



made by Archbishop Hughes and Father Gavazzi. An occasional visit



from Washington Irving or Senator (afterward President) Buchanan,



as well as other men of light and leading, aroused my tendencies



toward hero-worship; but perhaps the event most vividly stamped



into my memory was the parade of Mme. Jumel. One afternoon at



that period she appeared in the streets of Saratoga in an open



coach-and-four, her horses ridden by gaily dressed postilions.



This was regarded by very many visitors as an affront not merely



to good morals, but to patriotism, for she had the fame of having



been in relations, more intimate than edifying, with Aaron Burr,



who was widely considered as a traitor to his country as well as



the murderer of Alexander Hamilton; and on the second day of her



parade, another carriage, with four horses and postilions, in all



respects like her own, followed her wherever she went and



sometimes crossed her path: but this carriage contained an



enormous negro, black and glossy, a porter at one of the hotels,



dressed in the height of fashion, who very gravely rose and



doffed his hat to the applauding multitudes on either side of the



way. Mme. Jumel and her friends were, of course, furious; and it



was said that her postilions would in future be armed with



pistols and directed to fire upon the rival equipage should it



again get in their way. But no catastrophe occurred; Mme. Jumel



took one or two more drives, and that was the end of it.







In my college days, from 1849 to 1853, going to and from New



Haven, I frequently passed through New York, and the progress of



the city northward since my earlier visits was shown by the fact



that the best hotel nearest the center of business had become



first the Irving House, just at the upper end of the City Hall



Park, and later the St. Nicholas and Metropolitan hotels, some



distance up Broadway. Staying in 1853 at a hotel looking out upon



what was to be Madison Square, I noticed that all north of that



was comparatively vacant, save here and there a few houses and



churches.







Going abroad shortly afterward, I gave three years to my



attacheship and student life in Europe, traveling across the



continent to St. Petersburg and back, as well as through Germany,



Switzerland, Austria, and Italy, all of which were then under the



old regime of disunion and despotism. To these journeys I refer



elsewhere.







Interesting to me, after my return home, were visits to Chicago



in 1858 and at various times afterward. At my first visits the



city was wretchedly unkempt. Workmen were raising its grade, and



their mode of doing this was remarkable. Under lines of brick and



stone houses, in street after street, screws were placed; and,



large forces of men working at these, the vast buildings went up



steadily. My first stay was at the Tremont House, then a famous



hostelry; and during the whole of my visit the enormous



establishment, several stories in height, was going on as usual,



though it was all open beneath and rising in the air perceptibly



every day. Years afterward, when Mr. George Pullman had become



deservedly one of the powers of Chicago, he gave me a dinner, at



which I had the pleasure of meeting a large number of the most



energetic and distinguished men of the city. Being asked by a



guest as to the time when I first visited Chicago, I stated the



facts above given, when my interlocutor remarked, "Yes, and if



you had gone down into the cellar beneath the Tremont House you



would have found our host working at one of the jack-screws." I



had already an admiration for Mr. Pullman; for he had told me of



his creation of the Pullman cars, and had shown me through the



beautiful artisan town which bears his name; but by this remark



my respect for him was greatly augmented.







My first visit to the upper Mississippi left an indelible



impression on my mind. No description of that vast volume of



water slowly moving before my eyes ever seemed at all adequate



until, years afterward, I read Mark Twain's "Tom Sawyer," and his



account of the scene when his hero awakes on a raft floating down



the great river struck a responsive chord in my heart. It was the



first description that ever answered at all to the picture in my



mind. Very interesting to me were sundry later excursions to



Boston, generally on university or other business. At one of



these I purchased the library of President Sparks for the



university, and, staying some days, had the pleasure of meeting



many noted men--among them Mr. Josiah Quincy, whose reminiscences



were to me very interesting, his accounts of conversations with



John Adams perhaps more so than anything else. At various clubs I



met most charming people, the most engrossing of these being



Arthur Gilman, the architect: then, and at other times, I sat up



with him late into the night,--once, indeed, the entire



night,--listening to his flow of quaint wit and humor. The range



of his powers was perhaps best shown in a repetition of what he



claimed to be the debate in the city council of Boston on his



plans for a new city hall, which were afterward adopted. The



speeches in Irish brogue, Teutonic Jargon, and down-east Yankee



dialect, with utterances interposed here and there by solemnly



priggish members, were inimitable. His pet antipathy seemed to be



the bishop of the diocese, Dr. Eastburn. Stories were told to the



effect that Gilman, early in life, had desired to take orders in



the Protestant Episcopal Church, but that the bishop refused to



ordain him, on the ground that he lacked the requisite



discretion. Hence, perhaps his zeal in preaching what he claimed



to be the bishop's sermons. Dr. Eastburn was much given to



amplification, and Gilman always insisted that he had heard him



once, when preaching on the parable of Dives and Lazarus, discuss



the prayer of Dives in torments for a drop of water, as follows:



"To this, my brethren, under the circumstances entirely natural,



but, at the same time, no less completely inadmissible request,



the aged patriarch replied."







The bishop, who enjoyed a reputation for eloquence, was wont to



draw his lungs full of air at frequent periods during his



discourses, thus keeping his voice strong, as skilful



elocutionists advise; and on one very warm summer afternoon,



according to Gilman's account, a little boy in the congregation,



son of one of the most distinguished laymen in the diocese,



becoming very uneasy and begging his mother to allow him to go



home, she had quieted him several times by assuring him that the



bishop would soon be through, when, just at one of the most



impressive passages, the bishop having drawn in his breath as



usual, the little boy screamed so as to be heard throughout the



church, "No, he won't stop, mama; no, he won't stop; don't you



see he has just blowed hisself up again?"







Gilman also told us a story of the bishop's catechizing the



children in a Boston church, when, having taken the scriptural



account of Jonah and carried the prophet into the whale's belly,



he asked very impressively, "And now, children, how do you



suppose that Jonah felt?" Whereupon little Sohier, son of the



noted lawyer, piped out, "Down in the mouth, sir." Gilman



insisted that the bishop was exceeding wroth, and complained to



the boy's father, who was unable to conceal from the bishop his



delight at his son's answer.







At one visit or another, mainly during the years of my connection



with Cornell University, I met at Boston, pleasantly, the men who



were then most distinguished in American literature. One of



these, who interested me especially, was Ticknor, author of the



"History of Spanish Literature." Longfellow always seemed to me a



most lovely being, whether at Nahant or at Cambridge. Lowell was



wonderfully brilliant as well as kindly, and Edward Everett Hale



delightful. It was the time of Hale's short stories in the



"Atlantic Monthly," which seem to me the best ever written.



Oliver Wendell Holmes I met so rarely that I have little memory



of his brilliant conversation. Emerson I met then and at other



times,--once, especially, in a railway train during one of his



Western lecture tours; he was then reading the first volume of



Carlyle's "Frederick the Great," and, on my asking him how he



liked it, instead of showing his usual devotion to the author, he



burst forth into a stream of protests against Carlyle's



"everlasting scolding at Dryasdust." A man who was as much



overrated then as he is underrated now was Whipple, the essayist;



he was always bright, and often suggestive; but too reliant upon



a style which is now out of date,--frequently summoning



"alliteration's artful aid," and resorting to other devices,



fashionable then, but now discarded. Perhaps the best of all his



sentences was the one on the three great statesmen of that



period, to the effect that Webster was INductive, Calhoun



DEductive, and Clay SEductive; which was not only well stated but



true. Very vividly comes back to me a supper-party given early in



1875 at the house of James T. Fields, in celebration of Bayard



Taylor's birthday. Besides Mr. and Mrs. Fields and Taylor were



present Richard H. Dana, eminent in law and letters; Cranch, then



known both as a painter and poet; Mr. Osgood; and myself. Taylor



recited, as I had heard him do at other times, from the



productions of the Georgia poet, Chivers, and especially from the



"Eonx of Ruby." Chivers, according to Taylor's showing, had



become infatuated with Poe, and adorned his verses with every



sort of beautiful word which he could coin, the result being as



nonsensical a medley as was ever known. Earlier in the evening,



Taylor, Fields, and myself had each of us been giving a lecture,



and this led Taylor to speak of a recent experience of his while



holding forth in one of the smaller towns of Massachusetts. The



chairman of the lecture committee, being seated beside him on the



platform, and wishing to entertain him with edifying conversation



while the audience was coming in remarked that they had had



rather a trying experience during the lecture of the week before.



On Taylor's asking what it was, the chairman answered: "The



lecturer was seized by a virago on the stage." He meant vertigo.



Dana told good stories of old Dr. Osgood of Medford, whose hatred



of Democracy was shown not only in his well-known reading of



Governor Gerry's proclamation, but in his bitter sermon at the



election of Thomas Jefferson. At this some one gave a story



regarding our contemporary Dr. Osgood, the eminent Unitarian



clergyman, who, toward the end of his life, had gone into the



Protestant Episcopal Church. I had known him as a man of much



ability and power, but with a rather extraordinary way of



asserting himself and patronizing people. He had recently died,



and a legend had arisen that, on his arrival in the New



Jerusalem, being presented to St. Paul, he said: "Sir, I have



derived both profit and pleasure from your writings, and have



commended them to my congregation."







Our host, Fields, was especially delightful. He gave



reminiscences of his stay with Tennyson on the Isle of



Wight--among others, of taking a walk with him one dark evening



when, suddenly, the great poet fell on his knees, and seeming to



burrow in the grass called out gutturally and gruffly: "Man, get



down on your marrow-bones; here are violets." Fields also gave



reminiscences of Charles Sumner, showing the great senator's



utter lack of any sense of humor, and among them a story of his



summoning his office-boy to his presence on the eve of the Fourth



of July and addressing him on this wise: "Patrick, to-morrow is



the natal day of our Republic; it is a day for public rejoicing,



a time of patriotic festivity. You need not come to the office;



go out and rejoice with our fellow-citizens that your lot is cast



in so happy a country. Here are fifty cents; I advise you to pass



the day at the cemetery of Mount Auburn."







Very interesting to me were sundry excursions in the Southern



States, the first as far back as 1864. After attending the



Baltimore Convention which renominated Mr. Lincoln, and paying my



respects to him at Washington, as stated in my political



reminiscences, I went somewhat later to Richmond. Libby Prison



had a sad interest for me, as for many at that time, and on all



sides was seen the havoc of war; but perhaps the most curious



feature of my stay was a visit to the house which had served as



the White House of the Confederacy--the dwelling of Jefferson



Davis, for, just as I entered the door I met one of the arch



antislavery men of New England, Dr. Leonard Bacon of New Haven.



Both of us were happy at the outcome of the war, but it was with



a very solemn sort of joy that we thus met in such a place. I



seemed to hear, as so often in the South of that day, and,



indeed, in the North also, that fearful prophecy of Thomas



Jefferson--when speaking of slavery in the Southern



States--beginning with the words, "I tremble when I remember that



God is just." Halting at Gettysburg on my return northward, I



found marks of the terrible contest of the previous year still



vivid. For miles, in all directions, on the roads and through the



fields, were fragments of shell, of cannon, of harness, of



clothing, and equipments of every sort. The trees, especially



those near the great centers of the struggle, where the cemetery



now is, were gashed and torn in trunk and branches, and here and



there were to be seen fragments of human bodies which, having



been too hastily buried, had been washed out by the rains.







About ten years later,--February, 1875,--being much worn with



labor and care at the university, I made a short stay in the more



Southern States, my first stop being at Washington, where I



passed an interesting evening at the Executive Mansion with



President Grant, who was as simple and cordial in manner as ever.



The next day I left Washington for Richmond and the far South,



and on the morning following was aroused at one of the



way-stations by hearing negroes singing in a neighboring car.



They were happy at the prospect of breakfast, but a curious



preliminary was that each came out upon the platform, and, taking



a currycomb which was hung up for the purpose, curried himself,



much as an ostler administers that treatment to a horse--every



negro grasping in his turn the large wooden handle and pulling



the iron teeth through his plentiful wool.







Stopping next at Columbia in South Carolina, I saw flagrant



examples of carpet-bag rule; but of those in the State-house I



have already spoken. Here was a focus of Southern feeling; and at



the State University, which was charmingly situated, and



altogether a most fitting home for scholars and thinkers, I was



taken into the library where formerly stood the bust of Francis



Lieber, once a professor in the institution. Never had the South



a wiser or better friend. In after years I knew, loved, and



respected him. No man with a deeper knowledge of free



institutions, or with greater love for them, has ever lived in



our country; but when the news came to his old university, where



he had been so greatly admired, that he was true to the Union,



his marble bust was torn from its place, dishonored, and



destroyed. There could be no better illustration of Bishop



Butler's idea of "a possible insanity of States."







On Sunday, having been taken by one of the professors in the



university to a Protestant Episcopal church for colored people,



of which he was rector, I was surprised at the light color and



real beauty of many of the women present: nowhere, save in



Jamaica, had I seen people of mixed races so attractive. In



Charleston there were on all sides ruins, due not only to the



Civil War, but to the more recent fire and earthquake. It all



seemed as if the vengeance of Heaven had been wrought upon the



city. My sympathies were deeply enlisted; I felt no anger over



the past, no exultation. I was taken to a home for Confederate



orphans and to another for widows, and in both were pointed out



to me members of families, now hopelessly destitute, who before



the war lived in luxury. In no city, at home or abroad, have I



ever seen a line of stately mansions which seemed more fitting



abodes for wealth and culture than those upon the esplanade at



Charleston; in the days gone by a noble hospitality had centered



there, but all was now silent and distressed.







On the 4th of March we arrived in Florida and found it



fascinating. Never before had I been farther south upon the



mainland of the United States than Charleston, and never had I



seen anything of this region, save when the frigate bearing the



Santo Domingo Commission touched at Key West. Among the most



characteristic things at Jacksonville was a large church



belonging to the negro Baptists, who were evidently the leading



sect. The church was large, but unfinished, and a main feature of



every service was passing the hat for contributions. The services



were singular indeed. There was one old negro pastor who, though



he could read little if at all, had schooled himself to look into



the Bible while reciting parts of chapters, and to keep his eyes



upon the pages of his hymnal while repeating the hymns; and a



very weighty function was the reading of notices of every sort of



social gathering, especial prominence being given to meetings of



fire-engine companies. The number of Northern visitors was very



large, and it was evident that the negro managers of the



congregation felt the importance of keeping on good terms with



all of them without regard to party; for, on one occasion, as the



pastor was giving these notices, slowly deciphering them, with



the aid of a younger minister, and reading them mechanically, he



began as follows: "Dere will be a meetin' of de Republikins of



dis ward"--and instantly a number of the brethren started to



their feet, and put up their hands with a long "Hu-u-u-sh!" The



preacher was greatly embarrassed and passed on immediately to



"There will be a meeting of No. 2 Fire Company," etc., etc. Most



hearty of all was the singing, in which the whole congregation



joined loudly and with voices clear and silvery. After the



services were over there came regularly what was called the



"sperritual part." Some one of the more gifted singers--of whom,



perhaps, the most satisfactory was a young colored man in a black



velvet coat and a brilliant red tie--came forward, stood before



the pulpit, and began a long solo--as a rule, with scores of



verses. One was on the creation, another on the flood, each verse



paraphrasing the scriptural account; and the refrain, in which



the whole congregation joined, was as follows:







 "Ole Pharaoh he got law-s-t--



  Got law-s-t, got law-s-t--



  Ole Pharaoh he got drownded



  In the Re-e-e-e-d Sea."







But soon came a song which amazed me. It was totally different in



character from any of the others, and was called "The Seven



Glories of Mary." One of the verses ran as follows:







 "An' de berry next glory dat Mary she had,



  It was de glory of sebben--



  It was dat her Son Jesus he tolled de bells of hebben;"







and then, as at the end of each verse, came from the whole



congregation the refrain:







 "Oh, trials an' tribulashuns!



  I'm gwine to quit dis world."











Next day I sent for the singer and asked him where he had learned



his songs. His answer was, "Boss, I made 'em up myself." To this



I answered, "Quite likely, some of them; but not 'The Seven



Glories of Mary.' " He thought a moment, and then said, "Yes,



boss, you 're right; dat song I brought down from ole Virginny."



It was as I had thought. The song was an old Christmas carol,



evidently brought from England in Colonial times; and the



negroes, having substituted here and there a word or a phrase



which struck them as finer than the original had preserved it.







Strange, indeed, were the devotions of this great congregation.



Occasionally some old plantation negro, gray-headed and worn with



labor, would rise and lead in the prayers with a real



inspiration, pouring out his whole heart, with all its hopes and



sorrows. Never have I heard more pathetic supplications. More



than once I have seen tears streaming from the eyes of the



Northern visitors, and then, almost in a moment, the same faces



wreathed in smiles at some farce in giving out the notices or in



taking up the collections.







A charming episode in this Florida stay was an excursion up the



St. John's River, through beautiful semi-tropical vegetation. But



one thing was exceedingly vexatious. On the deck of the steamer



were various tourists who enjoyed themselves by shooting the



beautiful birds and interesting saurians of the region--mere



wanton killing, with never any stop to pick up the bodies of



these creatures. It reminded me of the old wastefulness in the



North,--the exhaustive fishing of the rivers and streams,



especially the trout-streams; the killing of deer by hundreds;



and the wanton extermination of the buffalo. Wonderful to me were



the great springs of the region--springs so large that the little



steamer could make its way to them and upon them, so that from



the deck we could look far, far down into the depths as through



clear crystal. Most interesting of the people I met were



Professor and Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe, who were passing the



winter in their house at Mandarin near by, and invited us to



visit them. Theirs was a happy-go-lucky sort of life, in a simple



cottage surrounded by great orange orchards, beyond which was a



fringe of palmettos. On the morning after our arrival, Mrs. Stowe



came in and said, "Well, we shall have dinner." To which I said,



"Of course we shall." "No," said she, "not 'of course,' for when



I awoke this morning there was nothing for dinner in the house,



and no prospect of anything in the village; but, taking my walk,



I met a negro with a magnificent wild turkey which he had just



shot, and that we will have." Just before dinner, our hostess and



I walked out into the orange orchard and there picked from the



trees a large market-basket full of the most beautiful oranges



ever seen,--large, sweet, and juicy; and these, embedded deftly



by her in a great mass of rich green leaves, glorified the table



during the discussion of the turkey, and became our dessert.



Never was there a more sumptuous dinner, and never better talk.



Mrs. Stowe was at her best, and the Doctor abounded in quaint



citations from French memoirs, of which he was an indefatigable



reader.







On the way North I stopped again at Charleston, visiting Drayton



Hall, a fine old mansion dating from 1740, but never completed,



surrounded by beautiful gardens filled with great azaleas in full



bloom, the most gorgeous I have ever seen in any part of the



world; but a cloud seemed to rise over it all when we were told



that, except in winter, remaining on the island was for white



people certain death. In all this journey through the South I



added much to my library regarding Secession and the Civil War;



accumulating newspapers, tracts, and books which became the



nucleus of the large Civil War collection at Cornell. Then, too,



there were talks with people on the train and in the hotels,



sometimes profitable and sometimes amusing. As to the feeling



between the whites and the negroes, a former master said to me,



"My old niggers will do anything I wish except cast their ballots



for me; they will give me anything they have in this world except



their votes; they would starve themselves for me, but they won't



vote for me." Among myriads of stories I heard one which seemed



to argue more philosophic power in the negro than many suppose



him to possess. A young planter at one of the Southern



watering-places appeared every day terribly bitten by mosquitos,



so that, finally, some of the guests said to his negro



body-servant, "Bob, why don't you take pains to protect your



master with mosquito curtains?" To which the negro answered, "No



use in it, sah; de fact is, sah, dat in de night-time Mars Tom is



too drunk to care for de skeeters, and in de daytime de skeeters



is too drunk to care for Mars Tom." There was also a revelation



of negro religious feeling in a story told me regarding "Thad"



Stevens. Mr. Stevens was in his day, on many accounts, the most



powerful member of the House of Representatives--at times a very



stern mentor to Mr. Lincoln, and to President Johnson a terror. I



remember him as rough and of acrid humor, but with a sort of



rugged power. The story was that one day, while at dinner, he



heard at the sideboard the crash of a platter, and immediately,



in a fury, called out, with a bitter oath, "Well, you idiot



--------, what have you broken now?" To which the negro woman



answered, "Bress de good Lord, it ain't de third commandmunt."







There were various other journeys on American soil, and among



them a very delightful summer stay, in 1884, at Nantucket; but of



all the impressions upon me at that period perhaps the strongest



was made by a piece of crass absurdity not unusual in a certain



stratum of American society. Making an excursion with my friend



President Gilman from Nantucket to the United States Fisheries



Station at Woods Hole, we stopped overnight at Martha's Vineyard,



a beautiful little island which has now become a sort of saints'



rest where, during the summer, a certain class of pious New



Englanders of the less intellectual type crowd themselves into



little cottages and enjoy a permanent camp-meeting. Never,



except, perhaps, among the dervishes of Cairo, have I seen any



religion more repulsive. On the evening of our arrival, Gilman



and I went into the large skating-rink where a German band was



blowing its best, and a large concourse of young men and women



from the various pious families of the place were disporting



themselves. Dancing was not allowed them, and so, with their arms



around each other's waists, they were executing various gyrations



on roller-skates to the sound of this music. Presently, as I sat



rather listlessly looking on, I was struck by a peculiar change



in the tune. Gilman, too, seemed in a way paralyzed by it; and,



turning to him, I said, "Tell me what that music is." Then he



came out of his daze and said, "Great heavens! it is 'Nearer, my



God, to Thee'--played as a waltz!" So it was. The whole thing, to



any proper religious, moral, or esthetic sense, was ghastly.



These pious young men and women, who, on no account, were allowed



to dance, were going through something far more indecent than any



dancing I had ever seen, and to music which was a travesty of one



of the most sacred of Christian compositions. I have long



regarded camp-meetings as among the worst influences to which our



rural youth are subjected--Joe Miller jokes in the pulpit,



hysterics in the pews, with an atmosphere often blasphemous and



sometimes erotic. A devoted country clergyman doing his simple



duty--trying to lift his congregation to better views of life,



partaking their joys and alleviating their sorrows, often a



martyr to meddlesome deacons or to pompous trustees, and his wife



a prey to the whimsical wives of opinionated pew-owners--such a



man I deeply revere; but the longer I live the more I am



convinced that the professional revivalist and the sensation



preacher are necessarily and normally foes both to religion and



to civilization.















CHAPTER LII







ENGLAND REVISITED--1885







In 1885, having resigned the presidency at Cornell, after twenty



years of service, I went to Europe; my main purpose being to



leave my successor untrammeled as to any changes which he might



see fit to make. He was an old friend and student of mine whom,



when the trustees had asked me to nominate a man to follow me I



had named as the best man I knew for the work to be done; but,



warm as were the relations between us, I made up my mind that it



was best to leave him an entirely free hand for at least a year.







Crossing the ocean, I had the close companionship of Thomas



Hughes ("Tom Brown"), and he was at his best. Among the stories



he told was one of Browning. The poet one morning, hearing a



noise in the street before his house, went to his window and saw



a great crowd gazing at some Chinamen in gorgeous costumes who



were just leaving their carriages to mount his steps. Presently



they were announced as the Chinese minister at the Court of St.



James and his suite. A solemn presentation having taken place,



Browning said to the interpreter, "May I ask to what I am



indebted for the honor of his Excellency's visit?" The



interpreter replied, "His Excellency is a poet in his own



country." Thereupon the two poets shook hands heartily. Browning



then said, "May I ask to what branch of poetry his Excellency



devotes himself?" to which the interpreter answered, "His



Excellency devotes himself to poetical enigmas." At this



Browning, recognizing fully the comic element in the situation,



extended his hand most cordially, saying, "His Excellency is



thrice welcome, he is a brother, indeed."







The month of October was passed in the southwest of England, and



there dwell in my mind recollections of Chatsworth, Haddon Hall,



and Bristol; but, above all, of a stay with the historian Freeman



at Wells. The whole life of that charming cathedral town and its



neighborhood was delightful. Freeman's kindness opened all doors



to us. The bishop, Lord Arthur Hervey, showed us kindly



hospitality at his grand old castle, which we had entered by a



drawbridge over the moat. Of especial interest to me was a



portrait of one of his predecessors--dear old Bishop Ken, whose



morning and evening hymns are among the most beautiful ties



between England and the United States. In the evening, dining



with the magistrates and lawyers, I heard good stories, among



them some characterizing various eminent members of the



profession, and of these I especially remember one at the expense



of the late Lord Chancellors Westbury and Cranworth. Lord



Cranworth, after the amalgamation of law and equity, was for some



time in the habit of going to sit with the new judges in order to



familiarize himself with the reformed practice, whereupon some



one asked Lord Westbury, "Why does 'Cranny' go to sit with the



judges?" to which Westbury answered, "Doubtless from a childish



fear of being alone in the dark."







Next day I was invited to sit with the squires in the Court of



Quarter Sessions, and was greatly interested in their mode of



administering justice. There was a firmness, but at the same time



a straightforward common sense about it all which greatly pleased



me. A visit to Wells Cathedral with Freeman was in its way ideal;



for never in all my studies of mediaeval buildings have I had so



good a guide. But perhaps the most curious experience of our stay



was an attendance upon a political meeting at Glastonbury, in the



Gladstonian interest. The first speech was made by the candidate,



Sir Hugh Davey; and in his anxiety to propitiate his hearers he



began by addressing them as men whose ancestors had for centuries



shown their devotion to free principles, and had especially given



proof of this by hanging the last Abbot of Glastonbury at the old



tower above the town. But, shortly afterward, when Freeman began



his speech, it was evident that his love of historical truth and



his devotion to church principles would not permit him to pass



this part of Davey's harangue unnoticed. Referring then



respectfully to his candidate for Parliament, Freeman went on to



say in substance that his distinguished friend was in error; that



the last Abbot of Glastonbury was not a traitor, but a martyr--a



martyr to liberty, and a victim of that arch-enemy of liberty,



Henry VIII. Any one who had heard Freeman in America as a



lecturer would have been amazed at his ability as a political



speaker. As a lecturer, trying to be eloquent while reading a



manuscript, he was generally ineffective and sometimes



comical,--worse even than the general run of lecturers in the



German universities, and that is saying much; but as a public



speaker he was excellent--so much so that, congratulating him



afterward, and bearing in mind the fact that he had been formerly



defeated for Parliament, I assured him that if he would come to



America and make speeches like that, we would most certainly put



him in Congress and keep him there.







Toward the end of October we went on to Exeter, and there, at



Heavitree Church, heard Bishop Bickersteth preach admirably,



meeting him afterward at our luncheon with the vicar, and taking



supper with him at the episcopal palace. He was perhaps best



known in America as the author of the poem, "Yesterday, To-day,



and Forever"; and of this he gave me a copy, remarking that every



year he received from the American publisher a check for fifty



pounds, though there was no copyright requiring any payment



whatever. In his study he showed me a copy of "The Book Annexed,"



which presented the enrichments and emendations which a number of



devout scholars and thinkers were endeavoring to make in the



Prayer-book of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United



States, and he spoke with enthusiasm of these additions, which,



alas! have never yet been adopted.







Next came a visit to Torquay, where Kent's Cavern, with its



prehistoric relics, interested me vastly. Looking at them, there



could be no particle of doubt regarding the enormous antiquity of



the human race. There were to be seen the evidences of man's



existence scattered among the remains of animals long ago



extinct--animals which must have lived before geological changes



which took place ages on ages ago. Mixed with remains of fire and



human implements and human bones were to be seen not only bones



of the hairy mammoth and cave-bear, woolly rhinoceros and



reindeer, which could have been deposited there only in a time of



arctic cold, but bones of the hyena, hippopotamus, saber-toothed



tiger, and the like, which could have been deposited only when



the climate was torrid. The conjunction of these remains clearly



showed that man had lived in England early enough and long enough



to pass through times of arctic cold, and times of torrid heat;



times when great glaciers stretched far down into England and,



indeed, into the Continent, and times when England had a land



connection with the European continent, and the European



continent with Africa, allowing tropical animals to migrate



freely from Africa to the middle regions of England.







The change wrought by such discoveries as these, not only in



England, but in Belgium, France, and elsewhere, as regards our



knowledge of the antiquity of the human race and the character of



the creation process, is one of the great things of our



epoch.[11]











[11] I have discussed this more fully in my "History of the



Warfare of Science with Theology," Vol. I, chap. vi.











Thence we visited various cathedral towns, being shown delightful



hospitality everywhere. There remains vividly in my memory a



visit to Worcester, where the dean, Lord Alwyn Compton, now



Bishop of Ely, went over the cathedral with us, and showed us



much kindness afterward at the deanery--a mediaeval structure,



from the great window of which we looked over the Severn and the



famous Cromwellian battle-field.







Salisbury we found beautiful as of old; then to Brighton and to



"The Bungalow" of Halliwell-Phillips the Shaksperian scholar, and



never have I seen a more quaint habitation. On the height above



the town Phillips had brought together a number of portable



wooden houses, and connected them with corridors and passages



until all together formed a sort of labyrinth; the only clue



being in the names of the corridors, all being chosen from



Shakspere, and each being enriched with Shaksperian quotations



appropriate and pithy. At his table during our stay we met



various interesting guests, one of whom suggested the idea



regarding the secret of Carlyle's cynicism and pessimism to which



reference is made in my "Warfare of Science." Next came visits to



various country houses, all delightful, and then a stay at



Oxford, to which I was reinitiated by James Bryce; and for two



weeks it was a round of interesting visits, breakfasts,



luncheons, and dinners with the men best worth knowing at the



various colleges. Interesting was a visit to All Souls College,



which, having been founded as a place where sundry "clerks"



should pray for the souls of those killed at the battle of Crecy,



had, as Sir William Anson, its present head, showed me, begun at



last doing good work after four hundred years of uselessness. In



the chapel was shown me the restored reredos, which was of great



size, extending from floor to ceiling, taking the place of the



chancel window usual in churches, and made up of niches filled



with statues of saints. As the heads of all the earlier statues



had been knocked off during the fanatical period, there had been



substituted, during the recent restoration, new statues of saints



bearing the heads of noted scholars and others connected with the



college, among which Max Muller once pointed out to me his own,



and a very good likeness it was. Interesting to me were Bryce's



rooms at Oriel, for they were those in which John Henry Newman



had lived: at that hearth was warmed into life the Oxford



Movement. At one of the Oriel dinners, Bryce spoke of the changes



at Oxford within his memory as enormous, saying that perhaps the



greatest of these was the preference given to laymen over



clergymen as heads of colleges. An example of this was the



president of Magdalen. I had met him not many years before in



Switzerland, as a young man, and now he had become the head of



this great college, one of the foremost in the university. This



impressed me all the more because my memory suggested a



comparison between him and the president at my first visit,



thirty years before: Warren, the present president, being an



active-minded layman hardly over thirty, and his predecessor,



Routh, a doctor of divinity, who was then in his hundredth year.



It was curious to see that, while this change had been made to



lay control, various relics of clerical dominance were still in



evidence, and, among these, the surplice worn by Bryce, a member



of Parliament, when he read the lessons from the lectern in Oriel



chapel. At another dinner I was struck by a remark of his, that



our problems in America seemed to him simple and easy compared



with those of England; but as I revise these recollections,



twenty years later, and think of the questions presented by our



acquisitions in the West Indies and in the Philippine and



Hawaiian islands, as well as the negro problem in the South and



Bryanism in the North, to say nothing of the development of the



Monroe Doctrine and the growth of socialistic theories, the query



comes into my mind as to what he would think to-day.











November 9, 1885.







Dining at All Souls with Professor Dicey, I met Professor



Gardiner, the historian, whom I greatly liked; his lecture on



"Ideas in English History," which I had heard in the afternoon,



was suggestive, thorough, and interesting: he is evidently one of



the historians whose work will last. In the hall I noted Lord



Salisbury's portrait in the place of honor.







Tuesday, November 10.







Breakfasting at Oriel with Bryce, I met Broderick, warden of



Merton, and there was an interesting political discussion. Bryce



thought Chamberlain had alarmed the well-to-do classes, but



trusted to Gladstone to bring matters around right, and, apropos



of some recent occurrences, remarked upon the amazing depth of



spite revealed in the blackballing at clubs. Took lunch at



Balliol, where the discussion upon general and American history



was interesting. Dined with Bryce at Oriel, and, the discussion



falling upon English and American politics, sundry remarks of



Fowler, president of Corpus Christi College, were pungent. He



evidently thinks bitterly of political corruption in America, and



I find this feeling everywhere here; politely concealed, of



course, but none the less painful. I could only say that the



contents of the caldron should not be judged from the scum thrown



to the surface. In the evening to Professor Freeman's and met Mr.



Hunt, known as a writer and an examiner in history. He complained



bitterly of the cramming system, as so many do; thought that



Jowett had done great harm by promoting it, and that the main



work now done is for position in the honor list,--cram by tutors



being everything and lectures nothing.







Wednesday, November 11.







Took luncheon with Fowler, president of Corpus Christi, a most



delightful and open-minded man. I have enjoyed no one here more,



few so much. We discussed the teaching of ethics, he lamenting



the coming in of Hegelianism, which seems mainly used by sophists



in upholding outworn dogmas. Afterward we took a long stroll



together, discussing as we walked his admirable little book on



"Progress in Morals"; I suggesting some additions from my own



experience in America. In the afternoon came Professor Freeman's



lecture on Constantine. It was a worthy presentation of a great



subject, but there were fewer than ten members of the university



present, and only two of these remained until the close. In the



evening I dined at Balliol, and, the conversation falling upon



the eminent master of the college, Jowett, and his friendship



with Stubbs, Bishop of Oxford, and Freeman, a budding cynic



recalled the verses:







 "I go first; my name is Jowett;



  I am the Master of Balliol College;



  Whatever's worth knowing, be sure that I know it;



  Whatever I don't know is not knowledge."[12]











[12] This is given differently in Tuckwell's reminiscences.











Whereupon some one cited a line from an Oxford satire: "Stubbs



butters Freeman, and Freeman butters Stubbs"; at which I could



only say that Jowett, Stubbs, and Freeman had seemed to me, in my



intercourse with them, anything but dogmatic, pragmatic, or



unctuous.







November 13.







In the morning breakfasted with Bryce and a dozen or more



graduates and undergraduates in the common room at Oriel, and was



delighted with the relations between instructors and instructed



then shown. Nothing could be better. The discussion turning upon



Froude, who had evidently fascinated many of the younger men by



his style, Bryce was particularly severe against him for his



carelessness as to truth. This reminded me of a remark made to me



by Moncure Conway, I think, that Froude had begun with the career



of a novelist, for which he had decided gifts; that Carlyle had



then made him think this sort of work unworthy, urging him to



write history; and that Froude had carried into historical



writing the characteristics of a romance-writer. In the afternoon



to a beautiful concert in the great hall of Christ Church. A



curious sort of accommodation in quasi-boxes was provided by



pushing the dining-tables to the sides of the room and placing



the audience in chairs upon them and in front of them; it seemed



to me more serviceable than cleanly. In the evening dined at



Lincoln College with the rector, Dr. Merry, who was very



agreeable and entertaining, giving interesting accounts of his



predecessor, Mark Pattison, and of Wilberforce when Bishop of



Oxford. One of the guests, a fellow of New College, told me that



some fifty years ago an American, being entertained there showed



the college dons how to make mint-julep, or something of the



sort, and then sent them a large silver cup with the condition



that it should be filled with this American drink every year on



the anniversary of the donor's visit, and that this is regularly



done. This pious donor must have been, I think, "Nat" Willis.







Sunday, November 15.







Lunched with Johnson, fellow of Merton, and met my old friend



Mlle. Blaze du Bury. Her comments, from the point of view of a



brilliant young Frenchwoman, on all she saw about her at Oxford



were pungent and suggestive. In the evening heard the Archbishop



of York Thompson, preach at St. Mary's. He urged the students to



consecrate themselves by their example to the maintenance of a



better standard of morality; but, despite his strength and force,



the sermon seemed heavy and perfunctory.







November 16.







To Windsor with a party of friends, and as we had a special



permit to see a large number of rooms and curious objects not



usually shown, the visit was very interesting. Sadly suggestive



was Gordon's Bible, every page having its margins covered with



annotations in his own hand: it was brought from Khartoum after



his murder, presented by his sister to the Queen, and is now



preserved in an exquisitely wrought silver casket.







Tuesday, November 18.







Visited Somerville Hall for women, which shows a vast advance



over Oxford as I formerly knew it. To think that its creation



honors the memory of a woman who attained her high scientific



knowledge in spite of every discouragement, and who, when she had



attained it, was denounced outrageously from the pulpit of York



Minster for it! Dined at Merton College with the warden, Hon.



George Broderick, in the hall, which has been most beautifully



restored by Sir Gilbert Scott. When will the founders of our



American colleges and universities understand the vast



educational value of surroundings like these, and especially of a



"hall" in which students meet every day, beneath storied windows



and the busts and portraits of the most eminent men in the



history of science, literature, and public service?







In answer to the question whether in American universities there



was anything like the association between instructors and



students in England, I spoke of the evolution of our fraternity



houses as likely to bring about something of the sort. The



fraternal relation between teachers and taught is certainly the



best thing in the English universities, and covers a multitude of



sins. If I were a great millionaire I would establish in our



greater universities a score or so of self-governing colleges,



each with comfortable lodging-rooms and studies and with its own



library and dining-hall. In the common room, after dinner, I sat



next Professor Wallace, whose book on Kant I had read. He thinks



the system of ethics really predominant in England is modified



Kantianism.







November 19.







To Mortimer, near Reading, on a visit to Sir Paul Hunter, who



once visited me at Cornell. Extracts from my diary of this visit



are as follows:







November 20.







To Bearwood, the seat of John Walter, M.P., proprietor of the



"Times," and for the first time in my life saw a fox hunt, with



the meet, the huntsmen in red coats, and all the rest of it.







November 21.







Visited the old Abbey Church at Reading with Sir Paul, and in the



evening met various interesting people at dinner, among them Sir



John Mowbray, M.P. for Oxford and Mr. Walter.







Sunday, November 22.







After morning service in the beautiful parish church which, with



its schools, was the gift of Mr. Benyon, several of us took a



walk to Silchester, with its ruins of an old Roman bath, on the



Duke of Wellington's estate. In the evening Mr. Walter, who



usually appears so reticent and quiet, opened himself to me quite



freely, speaking very earnestly regarding the unfortunate turn



which the question between Catholics and Protestants has taken in



England under pressure from the Vatican, especially as regards



marriages, and illustrating his view by some most suggestive



newspaper cuttings. He also gave me what he claimed was the true



story of Earl Russell's conduct in letting out the Confederate



cruisers against us during the Civil War, attributing it to the



fact that an underling charged with preventing it went suddenly



mad, so that the matter did not receive early attention. But this



did not modify my opinion of Earl Russell. Thank Heaven, he lived



until he saw Great Britain made to pay heavily for his obstinacy.



Pity that he did not live to see the present restoration of good



feeling between the two countries; esto perrpetua (1905).







Monday, November 23.







In the afternoon drove to "Bramshill," the magnificent seat of



Sir William Cope; after all, there has never been any domestic



architecture so noble as the Elizabethan and Jacobean. In the



evening to a Tory meeting, Sir John Mowbray presiding; his



opening speech astounded me. Presenting the claims of his party,



he said that the Tories were not only the authors of extended



suffrage under Lord Beaconsfield, but that they ought also to



have the credit of free trade in grain, since Sir Robert Peel had



supported the bill for the repeal of the corn laws. Remembering



the treatment which Sir Robert Peel received from Disraeli and



the Tory party for this very act, it seemed to me that Sir John's



speech was the coolest thing I had ever heard in my life. It was



taken in good part, however. In America I am quite sure that such



a speech would have been considered an insult to the audience.







November 24.







To Cambridge, where I met a number of old friends, including Dr.



Waldstein, director of the Fitzwilliam Museum, and Sedley Taylor,



fellow of Trinity; and in the evening dined at King's College



with the former and a number of interesting men, including



Westcott, the eminent New Testament scholar (since Bishop of



Durham).







November 26.







Dined at Trinity College with Sedley Taylor and others, and



thence to the Politico-Economic Association to hear a discussion



upon cooperation in production; those taking the principal part



in the meeting being sundry leading men among the professors and



fellows devoted to political economy. During the day I called on



Robertson Smith, the eminent biblical critic, who, having been



thrown out of the Free Church of Scotland for revealing sundry



truths in biblical criticism a dozen years too soon, has been



received into a far better place at Cambridge.







November 27.







Had a delightful hour during the morning in King's College chapel



with Bradshaw, the librarian of the university--a most



accomplished man. He has a passion for church architecture, and



his discussions of the wonderful stained windows of the chapel



were very interesting. The evening service at King's College was



most beautiful: nothing could be more perfect than the antiphonal



rendering of the Psalms by the two choirs and the great organ.



More and more I am impressed by the EDUCATIONAL value of such



things.







November 28.







During the greater part of the day in the library of Trinity



College with Sedley Taylor. Years before, I had explored its



treasures with Aldis Wright, but there were new things to



fascinate me. Dining at King's College with Waldstein, met



Professor Seeley, author of the "Life of Stein," a book which,



ever since its appearance, has been an object of my admiration.







November 29.







In the morning, at King's College chapel, I was greatly struck by



the acoustic properties of this immense building; for, having



seated myself near the door at the west end, I distinctly heard



every word of the prayer for the church militant as it was



recited before the altar at the other end. Afterward, at Oscar



Browning's rooms, looked over a multitude of interesting



documents, including British official reports from New York



during our War of the Revolution; and in the evening, at



Waldstein's rooms, met Sir Henry Maine and discussed with him his



book on "Popular Government." He interested me greatly, and I



pointed out to him some things which, in my opinion, he might



well dwell more strongly upon in future editions, and among these



the popularity of the veto power in the United States, as shown



in its extension by recent legislation of various States to items



of supply bills.







At noon to luncheon at Christ's College with Professor Robertson



Smith, the Scotch heretic. This was the Cambridge home of Milton



and Darwin, interesting memorials of whom were shown me. Among



the guests was Dr. Creighton, professor of ecclesiastical



history. The early part of Creighton's book on the "History of



the Papacy During the Reformation Period" had especially



interested me, and I now enjoyed greatly his knowledge of Italian



matters. He discussed Tomasini's book on Machiavelli, and sundry



new Italian books on the relations of the Popes and Fra Paolo



Sarpi.







November 30.







Took tea at St. Mary's Hall with Sir Henry Maine, and continued



our discussion on his "Popular Government," which, while opposed



to democracy, pays a great tribute to the Constitution of the



United States. Dined with Professor Creighton; met various



interesting people, and discussed with him and Mrs. Creighton



sundry points in English history, especially the career of



Archbishop Laud; my opinion of Macaulay's injustice being



confirmed thereby.







December 11.







Went in the morning with Sedley Taylor and Professor Stuart,



M.P., an old friend of former visits, and inspected the



mechanical laboratory and workshops. There were about seventy



university men, more or less, engaged in these, and it was



interesting to see English Cambridge adopting the same line which



we have already taken at Cornell against so much opposition, and



surprising to find the Cambridge equipment far inferior to that



of Cornell. Afterward visited the polling booths for an election



which was going on, and noted the extraordinary precautions



against any interference with the secrecy of the ballot. Also to



the Cavendish physical laboratory, which, like the mechanical



laboratory, was far inferior in equipment to ours at Cornell. In



the evening to the Greek play,--the "Eumenides" of



aeschylus,--which was wonderfully well done. The Athena, Miss



Case of Girton College, was superb; the Apollo imposing; the



Orestes a good actor; and the music very effective. I found



myself seated next Andrew Lang, so well known for his literary



activity in various fields; and on speaking to him of the evident



delights of life at Cambridge and Oxford, I found that he had



outlived his enthusiasm on that subject.







December 2.







In the morning took a charming walk through St. Peter's, Queen's,



and other colleges, enjoying their quiet interior courts, their



halls and cloisters, the bridges across the Cam, and the walks



beyond. Then to a lecture by Professor Seeley on "Forces of



Government in History." It was admirably clear, though, in parts,



perhaps too subtle. As to England he summed all up by saying that



its present system was simply revolution at any moment. Walking



home with him afterward, I asked why, if his statement were



correct, it did not realize the old ideal in France--namely, that



of "La revolution en permanence." At luncheon with Waldstein at



King's College we found Lord Lytton, recently governor-general of



India, known to literature as "Owen Meredith," with Lady Lytton;



also Sir William Anson, provost of All Souls; as well as the



Athena of last evening, Miss Case; the Orestes, the Apollo, Sir



Henry Maine, and others. I was amused at the difference between



Lord Lytton's way of greeting me and his treatment of Sir William



Anson. When I was introduced, he at once took me by the hand, and



began talking very cordially and openly; but when his eminent



countryman was introduced, each eyed the other as if in



suspicion, did not shake hands, bowed very coldly, and said



nothing beyond muttering some one of the usual formulas. It was a



curious example of the shyness of Englishmen in meeting each



other, and of their want of shyness in meeting men from other



countries. At table Lord Lytton spoke regarding the annexation of



Burmah, likely to be accomplished by the dethronement of the



king, Theebaw; said that it ought to have been accomplished long



ago, and that the delay of action in the premises was due to



English timidity. Both he and Lady Lytton were very agreeable. He



gave an interesting account of a native drama performed before



him in India at the command of one of the great princes, though



speaking of it as "deadly dull." Speaking of difficulties in



learning idioms, he told the story of a German professor who,



priding himself on his thorough knowledge of English idioms,



said, "We must, as you English say, take ze cow by ze corns." At



this some one rejoined with the story of the learned baboo in



India who spoke of something as "magnificent, soul-inspiring, and



tip-top." As another example of baboo English was mentioned the



inscription upon one of the show-cases in an exhibition in India:



"All the goods in this case are for sale, but they cannot be



removed until after the day of judgment."







In the evening met the Historical Club at Oscar Browning's rooms,



and heard an admirable paper by Professor Seeley on "Bourbon



Family Compacts." He said that the fact of their existence was



not fully established until Ranke mentioned them, and that he,



Seeley, then examined the English Foreign Office records and



found them. He spoke of them as refuting the arguments of



Macaulay and others as to the folly of supposing that different



branches of the same family on different thrones are likely to



coalesce. Oscar Browning then read a paper on the flight of Louis



XVI to Varennes. It was elaborate, and based on close study and



personal observation. Browning had even taken measurements of the



distance over which King Louis passed on that fatal night, with



the result that he proved Carlyle's account to be entirely



inaccurate, and his indictment against Louis XVI based upon it to



be absurd. So far from the King having lumbered along slowly



through the night in Mme. Korf's coach because he had not the



force of character to make his driver go rapidly, Browning found



that the journey was made in remarkably quick time.







December 3.







Breakfasting with Sedley Taylor, I met Professor Stuart, M.P.,



who thinks a great liberal, peaceful revolution in the English



constitution will be accomplished within the next fifty years.



Thence walked with Taylor to Newnham College, where we were very



kindly received by Miss Gladstone, daughter of the prime



minister, and shown all about the place. We were also cordially



received by Miss Clough, and made the acquaintance of two



American girls, one from New Jersey and the other from



California. Much progress had been made since my former visit



under the guidance of Professor and Mrs. Fawcett. Thence to Jesus



College chapel and saw William Morris's stained glass, which is



the most beautiful modern work of the kind known to me.







December 4.







Visited St. John's, St. Peter's, and other colleges; in the



afternoon saw the eight-oared boats come down the river in fine



style; and in the evening went to the annual "audit dinner" at



Trinity College, the number of visitors in the magnificent hall



being very large. I found myself between the vice-master,



Trotter, and Professor Humphrey, the distinguished surgeon. The



latter thought Vienna had shot ahead of Berlin in surgery, though



he considered Billroth too venturesome, and praised recent



American works on surgery, but thought England was still keeping



the lead. At the close of the dinner came a curious custom. Two



servants approached the vice-master at the head of the first



table, laid down upon it a narrow roll of linen, and then the



guests rolled this along by pushing it from either side until,



when it had reached the other end, a strip of smooth linen was



left along the middle of the whole table. Then a great silver



dish, with ladles on either side, and containing some sort of



fragrant fluid, was set in front of the vice-master, upon the



narrow strip of linen which had formed the roll, and the same



thing was repeated at each of the other tables. The vice-master



having then filled a large glass at his side from the dish, and



I, at his suggestion, having done the same, the great dish was



pushed down the table to guest after guest, each following our



example. Waiting to see what was to follow, I presently observed



a gentleman near me dipping his napkin into his glass and



vigorously scrubbing his face and neck with it, evidently to cool



himself off after dinner; this was repeated with more or less



thoroughness by others present; and then came a musical grace



after meat--the non nobis, Domine --wonderfully given by the



choir. In the combination room, afterward, I met most agreeably



Mr. Trevelyan, M.P., a nephew of Macaulay, who has written an



admirable biography of his uncle.







December 6.







Dined at Trinity College as the guest of Aldis Wright, and met a



number of interesting men, among them Mahaffy, the eminent



professor of Greek at Trinity College, Dublin. Both he and Wright



told excellent stories. Among those of the latter was one of a



Scotchwoman who, on being informed of the change made by the



revisers in the Lord's Prayer,--namely, "and deliver us from the



evil one,"--said, "I doot he'll be sair uplifted." Mahaffy gave



droll accounts of Whately, Archbishop of Dublin. One of these had



as its hero a country clergyman who came to ask Whately for a



living which had just become vacant. The archbishop, thinking to



have a little fun with his guest, said, "Of course, first of all,



I must know what your church politics are: are you an



attitudinarian, a latitudinarian, or a platitudinarian?" To which



the parson replied, "Thank God, your Grace, I am not an Arian at



all at all, if that's what ye mane." The point of this lay in the



fact that among the charges constantly made by the High-church



party against Whately was that of secret Unitarianism. But the



reply so amused Whately that he bestowed the living on the old



parson at once. Mahaffy also said that when Archbishop Trench,



who was a man exceedingly mindful of the proprieties of life,



arrived in Dublin he assured Mahaffy that he intended to follow



in all things the example of his eminent predecessor, whereupon



Mahaffy answered, "Should your Grace do so, you will in summer



frequently sit in your shirt sleeves on the chains in front of



your palace, swinging to and fro, and smoking a long pipe."







Some one capped this with a story that, on a visitor once telling



Whately how a friend of his in a remote part of Ireland had such



confidence in the people about him that he never locked his



doors, the archbishop quietly replied, "Some fine morning, when



your friend wakes, he will find that he is the only spoon left in



the house."







December 7.







For several days visiting attractive places in London. Of most



interest to me were talks with Lecky, the historian. He



especially lamented Goldwin Smith's expatriation, and referred to



his admirable style, though regretting his lack of continuity in



historical work. Though an Irishman devoted most heartily to



Ireland, Lecky thought Gladstone's home rule policy suicidal. On



my telling him of Oscar Browning's study of Louis XVI's flight to



Varennes, he stood up for Carlyle's general accuracy. He liked



Sir Henry Maine's book, but was surprised at so much praise for



"The Federalist," since he thought Story's "Commentaries" much



better. He thought Draper's "History of the Intellectual



Development of Europe" showed too much fondness for very large



generalizations. He liked Hildreth's "History of the United



States" better than Bancroft's, and I argued against this view.



He praised Buckle's style, and when I asked him regarding his own



"Eighteenth Century," he said it was to be longer than he had



expected. As to his "European Morals," he said that it must be



recast before it could be continued. Returning to the subject of



home rule in Ireland, he said it was sure to lead to religious



persecution and confiscation. He speaks in a very low, gentle



voice, is tall and awkward, but has a very kind face, and pleases



me greatly. During my stay in London I did some work in the



British Museum on subjects which interested me, and at a visit to



Maskelyne and Cooke's great temple of jugglery in Piccadilly saw



a display which set me thinking. Few miracle-mongers have ever



performed any feats so wonderful as those there accomplished; the



men and women who take such pleasure in attributing spiritual and



supernatural origin to the cheap jugglery of "mediums" should see



this performance.















CHAPTER LIII







FRANCE, ITALY, AND SWITZERLAND--1886-1887







New Year's day of 1886 found my wife and myself again in Paris;



and, during our stay of nearly a fortnight there, we met various



interesting persons--among them Mr. McLane, the American minister



at that post, whom I had last seen, over thirty years before,



when we crossed the ocean together--he then going as minister to



China, and I as attache to St. Petersburg. His discussions both



of American and French politics were interesting; but a far more



suggestive talker was Mme. Blaze de Bury. Though a Frenchwoman,



she was said to be a daughter of Lord Brougham; his portrait hung



above her chair in the salon, and she certainly showed a



versatility worthy of the famous philosopher and statesman, of



whom it was said, when he was appointed chancellor, that if he



only knew a little law he would know a little of everything. She



apparently knew not only everything, but everybody, and abounded



in revelations and prophecies.







On the way from Paris to the Riviera we encountered at Lyons very



cold weather, and, giving my wraps to my wife, I hurried out into



the station in the evening, bought of a news-vender a mass of old



newspapers, and, having swathed myself in these, went through the



night comfortably, although our coupe was exposed to a most



piercing wind.







Arriving at Cannes, we found James Bryce of the English



Parliament, Baron George von Bunsen of the German Parliament, and



Lord Acton (since professor of history at the University of



Cambridge), all interesting men, but the latter peculiarly so:



the nearest approach to omniscience I have ever seen, with the



possible exception of Theodore Parker. Another person who



especially attracted me was Sir Charles Murray, formerly British



minister at Lisbon and Dresden. His first wife was an



American,--Miss Wadsworth of Geneseo,--and he had traveled much



in America--once through the Adirondacks with Governor Seymour of



New York, of whom he spoke most kindly. Discussing the Eastern



Question, he said that any nation, except Russia, might have



Constantinople; he gave reminiscences of old King John of Saxony,



who was very scholarly, but the last man in the world to be a



king. Most charming of all were his reminiscences of Talleyrand.



The best things during my stay were my walks and talks with Lord



Acton, who was full of information at first hand regarding



Gladstone and other leaders both in England and on the Continent.



Although a Roman Catholic, he spoke highly of Fraser, late



Anglican Bishop of Manchester. As to Americans, he had known



Charles Sumner in America, but had not formed a high opinion of



him, evidently thinking that the senator orated too much; he had



with him a large collection of books, selected, doubtless, from



his two large libraries, in London and in the Tyrol, and with



this he astonished one as does a juggler who, from a single small



bottle, pours out any kind of wine demanded. For example, one



day, Bunsen, Bryce, and myself being with him, the first-named



said something regarding a curious philological tract by Bernays,



put forth when Bunsen was a student at Gottingen, but now



entirely out of print. At this Lord Acton went to one of his



shelves, took down this rare tract, and handed it to us. So, too,



during one of our walks, the talk happening to fall upon one of



my heroes, Fra Paolo Sarpi, I asked how it was that, while in the



old church on the Lagoon at Venice I had at three different



visits sought Sarpi's grave in vain, I had at the last visit



found it just where I had looked for it before. At this he gave



me a most interesting account of the opposition of Pope Gregory



XVI--who, before his elevation to the papacy, had been abbot of



the monastery --to Sarpi's burial within its sacred precincts,



and of the compromise under which his burial was allowed. This



compromise was that his bones, which had so long been kept in the



ducal library to protect them from clerical hatred, might be



buried in the church on the island, provided Sarpi were, during



the ceremonies, honored simply as the discoverer of the



circulation of the blood,--which he probably was not,--and not



honored as the greatest statesman of Venice--which he certainly



was. This, as I then supposed, closed the subject; but in the



afternoon a servant came over, bringing me from Lord Acton a most



interesting collection of original manuscripts relating to



Sarpi,--a large part of them being the correspondence between the



papal authorities and the Venetians who had wished to give



Sarpi's bones decent burial, over half a century before. I now



found that the reason why I had not discovered the grave was that



the monks, as long as they were allowed control, had persisted in



breaking up the tablet bearing the inscription; that they could



not disturb the bones for the reason that Sarpi's admirers had



inclosed them in a large and strong iron box, anchoring it so



that it was very difficult to remove; but that since the death of



the late patriarch and the abolition of monkish power the



inscription over the grave had been allowed to remain



undisturbed.







During another of our morning walks the discussion having fallen



on witchcraft persecution, Lord Acton called in the afternoon and



brought me an interesting addition to my collection of curious



books on that subject--a volume by Christian Thomasius.







On another of our excursions I asked him regarding the



Congregation of the Index at Rome, and its procedure. To this he



answered that individuals or commissions are appointed to examine



special works and reports thereupon to the Congregation, which



then allows or condemns them, as may seem best; and I marveled



much when, in the afternoon of that day, he sent me specimens of



such original reports on various books.







He agreed with me that the papal condemnation of Victor Hugo's



"Les Miserables" was a mistake as a matter of policy--as great a



mistake, indeed, as hundreds and thousands of other condemnations



had been. Of Pope Leo XIII he spoke with respect, giving me an



account of the very liberal concessions made by him at the



Vatican library, so that it is now freely opened to Protestants,



whereas it was formerly kept closely shut. At a later period this



was confirmed to me by Dr. Philip Schaff, the eminent Protestant



church historian, who told me that formerly at the Vatican



library he was only allowed, as a special favor, to look at the



famous Codex, with an attendant watching him every moment;



whereas after Pope Leo XIII came into control he was permitted to



study the Codex and take notes from it at his ease.







In another of his walks Lord Acton discussed Gladstone, whom he



greatly admired, but pointed out some curious peculiarities in



the great statesman and churchman, --among these, that he



worshiped the memory of Archbishop Laud and detested the memory



of William III.







Very interesting were sundry little dinners on Saturday evenings



at the Cercle Nautique, at which I found not only Lord Acton, but



Sir Henry Keating, a retired English judge; General Palfrey, who



had distinguished himself in our Civil War; and a few other good



talkers. At one of these dinners Sir Henry started the question:



"Who was the greatest man that ever lived?" Lord Acton gave very



interesting arguments in favor of Napoleon, while I did my best



in favor of Caesar; my argument being that the system which



Caesar founded maintained the Roman Empire during nearly fifteen



hundred years after his death; that its fundamental ideas and



features have remained effective in various great nations until



the present day; and that they have in our own century shown



themselves more vigorous than ever. Lord Acton insisted that we



have no means of knowing the processes of Caesar's mind; that we



know the mode of thinking of only two ancients, Socrates and



Cicero; that possibly, if we knew more of Shakspere's mental



processes, the preeminence might be claimed for him, but that we



know nothing of them save from his writings; while we know



Napoleon's thoroughly from the vast collections of memoirs, state



papers, orders, conversations, etc., as well as in his amazing



dealings with the problems of his time; that the scope and power



of Napoleon's mental processes seem almost preternatural and of



this he gave various remarkable proofs. He argued that



considerations of moral character and aims, as elements in



greatness, must be left out of such a discussion; that the



intellectual processes and their results were all that we could



really estimate in comparing men. Sir Henry Keating observed that



his father, an officer in the British army, was vastly impressed



by the sight of Napoleon at St. Helena; whereupon Lord Acton



remarked that Thiers acknowledged to Guizot, who told Lord Acton,



that Napoleon was "un scelerat." That seemed to me a rather



strong word to be used by a man who had done so much to revive



the Napoleonic legend Lord Acton also quoted a well-authenticated



story--vouched for by two persons whom he named, one of them



being the Count de Flahaut, who was present and heard the



remark--that when the imperial guards broke at Waterloo, Napoleon



said, "It has always been so since Crecy."







Toward the end of February we went on to Florence, and there met,



frequently, Villari, the historian; Mantegazzi; and other leading



Florentines. Mention being made of the Jesuit Father Curci, who



had rebelled against what he considered the fatal influence of



Jesuitism on the papacy, Villari thought him too scholastic to



have any real influence. Of Settembrini he spoke highly as a



noble character and valuable critic, though with no permanent



place in Italian literature. He excused the tardiness of Italians



in putting up statues to Giordano Bruno and Fra Paolo Sarpi,



since they had so many other recent statues to put up. As I look



back upon this conversation, it is a pleasure to remember that I



have lived to see both these statues--that of Bruno, on the place



in Rome where he was burned alive, and that of Sarpi, on the



place in Venice where the assassins sent by Pope Paul V left him



for dead.







Early in March we arrived in Naples, going piously through the



old sights we had seen several times before. Revisiting Amalfi, I



saw the archbishop pontificating at the cathedral: he was the



finest-looking prelate I ever saw, reminding me amazingly of my



old professor, Silliman of Yale. Then, during the stay of some



weeks in Sorrento, I took as an Italian teacher a charming old



padre, who read his mass every morning in one of the churches and



devoted the rest of the day to literature. He was at heart



liberal, and it was from him that I received a copy of the famous



"Politico-Philosophical Catechism," adopted by Archbishop Apuzzo



of Sorrento, than which, probably, nothing more defiant of moral



principles was ever written. The archbishop had been made by



"King Bomba" tutor to his son, and no wonder that the young man



was finally kicked ignominiously off his throne, and his country



annexed to the Italian kingdom. This catechism, written years



before by the elder Leopardi, but adopted and promoted by the



archbishop, was devoted to maintaining the righteousness of all



that system of extreme despotism, oath-breaking, defiance of



national sentiment, and violations of ordinary decency, which had



made the kingdom of Naples a byword during so many generations.



Therein patriotism was proved to be a delusion; popular education



an absurdity; observance of the monarch's sworn word opposition



to divine law; a constitution a mere plaything in the monarch's



hands; the Bible is steadily quoted in behalf of "the right



divine of kings to govern wrong"; and all this with a mixture of



cynicism and unctuousness which makes this catechism one of the



most remarkable political works of modern times.







At this time I made an interesting acquaintance with Francis



Galton, the eminent English authority on heredity. Discussing



dreams, he told me a story of a lady who said that she knew that



dreams came true; for she dreamed once that the number 3 drew a



prize in the lottery, and again that the number 8 drew it; and



so, she said, "I multiplied them together, 3 X 8 = 27, bought a



ticket bearing the latter number, and won the prize."







Very interesting were my meetings with Marion Crawford, the



author. Nothing could be more delightful than his villa and



surroundings, and his accounts of Italian life were fascinating,



as one would expect after reading his novels. Another new



acquaintance was Mr. Mayall, an English microscopist; he gave me



accounts of his visit to the Louvre with Herbert Spencer, who,



after looking steadily at the "Immaculate Conception" of Murillo,



said "I cannot like a painted figure that has no visible means of



support."







On my return northward I visited the most famous of Christian



monasteries,--the cradle of the Benedictine order,--Monte



Cassino, and there met a young English novice, who introduced me



to various Benedictine fathers, especially sundry Germans who



were decorating with Byzantine figures the lower story, near the



altar of St. Benedict. At dinner the young man agreed with me



that it might be well to have a Benedictine college at Oxford,



but thought that any college established there must be controlled



by the Jesuit order. He professed respect for the Jesuits, but



evidently with some mistrust of their methods. On my asking if he



thought he could bear the severe rule of his order, especially



that of rising about four o'clock in the morning and retiring



early in the evening, he answered that formerly he feared that he



could not, but that now he believed he could. On my tentative



suggestion that he come and establish a Benedictine convent on



Cayuga Lake, he told me that he should probably be sent to



Scotland.







The renowned old monastery seems to be mindful of its best



traditions, for it has established within its walls an admirably



equipped printing-house, in which I was able to secure for



Cornell University copies of various books by learned



Benedictines--some of them, by the beauty of their workmanship,



well worthy to be placed beside the illuminated manuscripts which



formerly came from the Scriptoria.







At Rome I was taken about by Lanciani, the eminent archaeologist



in control of the excavations, who showed me beautiful things



newly discovered and now kept in temporary rooms near the



Capitol. To my surprise, he told me that there is absolutely no



authentic bust of Cicero dating from his time; but this was



afterward denied by Story, the American sculptor, who pointed out



to me a cast of one in his studio. Story spoke gloomily of the



condition of Italy, saying that formerly there were no taxes, but



that now the taxes are crushing. He added that the greatest



mistake made by the present Pope was that, during the cholera at



Naples, he remained in Rome, while King Humbert went immediately



to that city, visited the hospitals, cheered the



cholera-stricken, comforted them, and supplied their wants.







On Easter Sunday I saw Cardinal Howard celebrate high mass in St.



Peter's. He had been an English guardsman, was magnificently



dressed, and was the very ideal of a proud prelate. The audience



in the immediate neighborhood of the altar were none too



reverential, and in other parts of the church were walking about



and talking as if in a market; all of this irreverence reminding



me of the high mass which I had seen celebrated by Pope Pius IX



at the same altar on Easter day of 1856.







Calling on the former prime minister, Minghetti, who had been an



associate of Cavour, I found him very interesting, as was also



Sambuy, senator of the kingdom and syndic of Turin, who was with



him. Minghetti said that the Italian school system was not yet



satisfactory, though young men are doing well in advanced



scientific, mathematical, historical, and economic studies. On my



speaking of a statistical map in my possession which revealed the



enormous percentage of persons who can neither read nor write in



those parts of Italy most directly under the influence of the



church, he said that matters were slowly improving under the new



regime. He spoke with respect of Leo XIII, saying that he was not



so bitter in his utterances against Italy as Pius IX had been.



Discussing Bismarck and Cavour, he said that both were eminently



practical, but that Cavour adhered to certain principles, such as



free trade, freedom of the church, and the like, whereas Bismarck



was wont to take up any principle which would serve his temporary



purpose. Minghetti hoped much, eventually, from Cavour's idea of



toleration, and spoke with praise of the checks put by the



American Constitution on unbridled democracy, whereupon I quoted



to him the remark of Governor Seymour in New York, the most



eminent of recent Democratic candidates for the Presidency, to



the effect that the merit of our Constitution is not that it



promotes democracy, but that it checks it. Minghetti spoke of Sir



Henry Maine's book on "Free Government" with much praise; in



spite of its anti-democratic tendencies, it had evidently raised



his opinion of the American Constitution. He also praised



American scientific progress. Sambuy said that the present growth



of the city of Rome is especially detested by the clergy, since



it is making the city too large for them to control; that their



bitterness is not to be wondered at, since they clearly see that,



no matter what may happen,--even if the kingdom of Italy were to



be destroyed to-morrow,--it would be absolutely impossible for



the old regime of Pope, cardinals, and priests ever again to



govern the city; that with this increase of the population, and



its long exercise of political power, the resumption of temporal



power by the Pope is an utter impossibility; that even if



revolution or anarchy came, the people would never again take



refuge under the papacy.







Very interesting were sundry gatherings at the rooms of Story,



the sculptor. Meeting there the Brazilian minister at the papal



court, I was amazed by his statements regarding the rules



restricting intercourse between diplomatists accredited to the



Vatican and those accredited to the Quirinal; he said that



although the minister from his country to the Quirinal was one of



his best friends, he was not allowed to accept an invitation from



him.







The American minister, Judge Stallo of Cincinnati, seemed to me



an admirable man, in spite of the stories circulated by various



hostile cliques. At the house of the British ambassador Stallo



spoke in a very interesting way of Cardinal Hohenlohe as far



above his fellows and capable of making a great pope. The



political difficulties in Italy, he said, were very great, and,



greatest of all, in Naples and Sicily. Dining with him, I met my



old friend Hoffmann, rector of the University of Berlin, and a



number of eminent Italian men of science, senators, and others.







At the house of Dr. Nevin, rector of the American Episcopal



church, I met the Dutch minister, who corroborated my opinion



that the British parliamentary system generally works badly in



the Continental countries, since it causes constantly recurring



changes in ministers, and prevents any proper continuity of state



action, and he naturally alluded to the condition of things in



France as an example.







Among other interesting people, I met the abbot of St. Paul



Outside the Walls, to whom Lord Acton, in response to my question



as to whether there was such a thing as a "learned Benedictine"



extant, had given me a letter of introduction. The good abbot



turned out to be an Irishman with some of the more interesting



peculiarities of his race; but his conversation was more vivid



than illuminating. He had reviewed various books for the



Congregation of the Index, one of these, a book which I had just



bought, being on "The Architecture of St. John Lateran." He held



a position in the Propaganda, and I was greatly struck by his



minute knowledge of affairs in the United States. The question



being then undecided as to whether a new bishopric for central



New York was to be established at Utica or Syracuse, he discussed



both places with much minute knowledge of their claims and of the



people residing in them. I put in the best word I could for



Syracuse, feeling that if a bishopric was to be established, that



was the proper place for it; and afterward I had the satisfaction



of learning that the bishop had been placed there. The abbot had



known Secretary Seward and liked him.







Leaving Rome in May, we made visits of deep interest to Assisi,



Perugia, Orvieto, and other historic towns and, arriving at



Florence again, saw something of society in that city. Count de



Gubernatis, the eminent scholar, who had just returned from



India, was eloquent in praise of the Taj Mahal, which, of all



buildings in the world, is the one I most desire to see. He



thinks that the stories regarding juggling in India have been



marvelously developed by transmission from East to West; that



growing the mango, of which so much is said, is a very poor



trick, as is also the crushing, killing, and restoration to life



of a boy under a basket; that these marvels are not at all what



the stories report them to be; that it is simply another case of



the rapid growth of legends by transmission. He said that hatred



for England remains deep in India, and that caste spirit is very



little altered, his own servant, even when very thirsty, not



daring to drink from a bottle which his master had touched.







Dining with Count Ressi at his noble villa on the slope toward



Fiesole, I noted various delicious Italian wines upon the table,



but the champagne was what is known as "Pleasant Valley Catawba,"



from Lake Keuka in western New York, which the count, during his



journey to Niagara, had found so good that he had shipped a



quantity of it to Florence.







A very interesting man I found in the Marquis Alfieri Sostegno,



vice-president of the Senate,--a man noted for his high character



and his writings. He is the founder of the new "School for



Political and Social Studies," and gave me much information



regarding it. His family is of mediaeval origin, but he is a



liberal of the Cavour sort. Preferring constitutional monarchy,



but thinking democracy inevitable, he asks, "Shall it be a



democracy like that of France, excluding all really leading men



from power, or a democracy influenced directly by its best men?"



In his school he has attempted to train young men in the



practical knowledge needed in public affairs, and hopes thus to



prepare them for the inevitable future. This college has



encountered much opposition from the local universities, but is



making its way.







Another man of the grand old Italian sort was Peruzzi, syndic of



Florence, a former associate of Cavour, and one of the leading



men of Italy. Calling for me with two other senators, he took me



to his country villa, which has been in the possession of the



family for over four hundred years, and there I dined with a very



distinguished company. Everything was large and patriarchal, but



simple. The discussions, both at table and afterward, as we sat



upon the terrace with its wonderful outlook over one of the



richest parts of Tuscany, mainly related to Italian matters. All



seemed hopeful of a reasonable solution of the clerical



difficulty. Most interesting was his wife, Donna Emilia, well



known for her brilliant powers of discussion and her beautiful



qualities as a hostess both at the Peruzzi palace in Florence and



in this villa, where one meets men of light and leading from



every part of the world.







From Florence we went on to the Italian lakes, staying especially



at Baveno, Lugano, and Cadenabbia. Especially interesting to me



were the scenes depicted in the first part of Manzoni's "Promessi



Sposi." An eminent Italian told me at this time that Manzoni



never forgave himself for his humorous delineations of the priest



Don Abbondio, who figures in these scenes after a somewhat



undignified fashion. Interesting also was a visit to the tomb of



Rosmini, with its portrait-statue by Vela, in the monastery



looking over the most beautiful part of the Lago Maggiore. Thence



by the St. Gotthard to Zurich, where we visited my old colleague,



Colonel Roth, the Swiss minister at Berlin. Very simple and



charming was his family life at Teufen. In the library I noticed



a curious shield, and upon it several swords, each with an



inscription; and, on my asking regarding them, I was told that



they were the official swords of Colonel Roth's



great-grandfather, grandfather, father, and himself, each of whom



had been Landamman of the canton. He told me that as Landamman he



presided from time to time over a popular assembly of several



thousand people; that it was a republic such as Rousseau



advocated,--all the people coming together and voting, by "yes"



and "no" and showing of hands, on the proposals of the Landamman



and his council. Driving through the canton, I found that, while



none of the people were rich, few were very poor, and that the



Catholic was much behind the Protestant part in thrift and



prosperity.







My love for historical studies interested me greatly in a visit



to the Abbey of St. Gall. The mediaeval buildings are virtually



gone, and a mass of rococo constructions have taken their place.



Gone, too, in the main, is the famous library of the middle ages;



but the eminent historian and archivist, Henne Am Rhyn, showed me



the ancient catalogue dating from the days of Charlemagne, and



one or two of the old manuscripts referred to in it, which have



done duty for more than a thousand years. Then followed my second



visit to the Engadine, reached by two days' driving in the



mountains from Coire; and during my stay at St. Moritz I made the



acquaintance of many interesting people,--among them Admiral



Irvine of the British navy. Speaking of the then recent sinking



of the Cunarder Oregon, he expressed the opinion that a squadron



of seven-hundred-ton vessels with beaks could best defend a



harbor from ironclads; and in support of this contention he cited



an experience of his own as showing the efficiency of the beak in



naval warfare. A few years before he had anchored in the Piraeus,



his ship, an ironclad, having a beak projecting from the bow, of



course under water. Noticing a Greek brig nearing him, he made



signals to her to keep well off; but the captain of the brig,



resenting this interference, and keeping straight on, endeavored



to pass, at a distance which, no doubt, seemed to him perfectly



safe, in front of the bows of the ironclad. The admiral said that



not the slightest shock was felt on board his own vessel; but the



brig sank almost immediately. She had barely grazed the end of



the beak. At another time the admiral spoke of the advance of the



British fleet, in which he held a command, upon Constantinople in



1878. The British Government supposed that the Turks had



virtually gone over to the Russians, and the first order was to



take the Turkish fortresses at Constantinople immediately; but



this order was afterward withdrawn, and the matter at issue was



settled in the ensuing European conference.







It was a pleasure to find at this Alpine resort my old friend



Story the sculptor. He gave us a comical account of the



presentation at the Vatican of Mr. George Peabody by Mr. Winthrop



of Boston. Referring to Mr. Peabody's munificence to various



institutions for aiding the needy, and especially orphans, Mr.



Winthrop, in a pleasant vein, presented his friend to Pope Pius



IX as a gentleman who, though unmarried, had hundreds of



children; whereupon the Pope, taking him literally, held up his



hands and answered, "Fi donc! fi donc!"







Our stay at St. Moritz was ended by a severe snowstorm early in



August. That was too much. I had left America mainly to escape



snow; my traveling all this distance was certainly not for the



purpose of finding it again; and so, having hugged the stove for



a day or two, I decided to return to a milder climate. Passing by



Vevey, we visited our friends the Brunnows at their beautiful



villa on the shore of Lake Leman, where my old president at the



University of Michigan, Dr. Tappan, had died, and it was with a



melancholy satisfaction that I visited his grave in the cemetery



hard by.







Stopping at Geneva over Sunday, I observed at the Cathedral of



St. Peter, Calvin's old church, that the sermon and service



carefully steered clear of the slightest Trinitarian formula, as



did the churches in Switzerland generally. Considering that



Calvin had burned Servetus in that very city for his disbelief in



the doctrine of the Trinity, this omission would seem enough to



make that stern reformer turn in his grave. Returning to Paris, I



again met Lecky, who was making a short visit to the French



capital; and, as we were breakfasting together Mme. Blaze de Bury



being present, our conversation fell on Parisian mobs. She



insisted that the studied inaction of the papal nuncio during the



Commune caused the murder of Darboy, Archbishop of Paris, who was



hated by the extreme clerical party on account of his coolness



toward infallibility and sundry other dogmas advocated by the



Jesuits. Lecky thought Lord Acton's old article in the "North



British Review" the best statement yet made on the St.



Bartholomew massacre The discussion having veered toward the



Jewish question, which was even then rising, Lecky said that



Shakspere probably never saw a Jew--that Jews were not allowed in



England in his time, the only exceptions being Queen Elizabeth's



physician and, perhaps, a few others.







During the latter part of September I started on an architectural



tour through the east of France, and was more than ever



fascinated by the beauty of all I found at Soissons, Laon,



Chalons, Troyes, and Rheims, the cathedral at the latter place



seeming even more grand than when I last saw it. I have never



been able to decide finally which is the more noble--Amiens or



Rheims; my temporary decision being generally in favor of that



one of the two which I have seen last. But I found iniquity



triumphant: the "restorers" had been at work, and had apparently



done their worst. A great scaffolding covered the superb



rose-window of the west front, perhaps the finest of its kind in



Christendom, and, in a little book published by one of the



canons, I soon learned the reason. It appears that the architect



superintending the "restoration" had dug a deep well at one



corner of one of the massive towers for the purpose of inspecting



the foundations; that he had forgotten to fill this well; and



that, during the winter, the water from the roofs, having come



down into it and frozen, had upheaved the tower at one corner,



with the result of crumbling and cracking this immense window



adjacent.







At Troyes it was hardly better. It is a city which probably never



had sixty thousand inhabitants, and yet here are four of the most



magnificent architectural monuments in Europe. But the work



wrought upon them under the pretext of "restoration" was no less



atrocious than that upon the cathedral at Rheims, and of this I



have given an example elsewhere.[13]











[13] See Chapter XXI.











Continuing my way homeward, I stopped a few days in London. From



my diary I select an account of the sermon preached in one of the



principal churches of the city by Dr. Temple,--then bishop of



London, but later archbishop of Canterbury,--before the lord



mayor, lady mayoress, and other notable people. The sermon was a



striking exhibition of plain common sense, without one particle



of what is generally known as spirituality. The text was, "Freely



ye have received, freely give," and the argument simply was that



the congregation worshiping in that old church had received all



its privileges from contributions made centuries before, and that



it was now their duty, in their turn, to contribute money for new



congregations constantly arising in the new population of London.



Of spiritual gifts to be acknowledged nothing was said. In the



afternoon took tea with Lecky, and on my referring to Earl



Russell, he spoke of him as wonderful in getting at the center of



an argument. Of Carlyle he said that he knew him in his last days



intimately, often walking with him; but that his mind failed him



sadly; that the last thing Lecky read him was a selection from



Burns's letters; and that Carlyle, when left to himself, often



toned down his harsh judgments of men. At his funeral, in



Scotland, Lecky was present, and, judging from his account, it



was one of the most dismal things ever known. Speaking of



America, Lecky said that Carlyle was really deeply attached to



Emerson; and he added that Dean Stanley, on his return from



America, told him that the best things he found there were the



private libraries, and the worst the newspapers. Lecky thought



Americans more prone to give themselves up to a purely literary



life than are the English, and cited Prescott, Irving, and



others. He spoke of "The Club," of which he is a member. It is



that to which Sir Joshua Reynolds, Dr. Johnson, Burke, and



Goldsmith belonged; its members dine together every fortnight;



one black ball excludes. Speaking of Gladstone, he thought that



he had greatly declined as a speaker of late years, and that no



one had had such power in clouding truth and obscuring a fact.







Returning to America, I again settled in my old quarters at



Cornell University, hoping to devote myself quietly to the work I



had in hand. My old home on the campus had an especial charm for



me, and I had begun to take up the occupations to which I



purposed to devote the rest of my life, when there came upon me



the greatest of all calamities--the loss of her who had been for



thirty years my main inspiration and support in all difficulties,



cares, and trials. For the time all was lost. In all calamities



hitherto I had taken refuge in work; but now there seemed no



motive for work, and at last, for a complete change of scene, I



returned to Europe, determined to give myself to the preparation



of my "History of the Warfare of Science with Theology."















CHAPTER LIV







EGYPT, GREECE, AND TURKEY--1888-1889







While under the influence of the greatest sorrow that has ever



darkened my life, there came to me a calamity of a less painful



sort, yet one of the most trying that I have ever known. A long



course of mistaken university policy, which I had done my best to



change, and the consequences of which I had especially exerted



myself to avert, at last bore its evil fruit. On the 13th of



June, 1888, I was present at the session of the Court of Appeals



at Saratoga, and there heard the argument in the suit brought to



prevent the institution from taking nearly two millions of



dollars bequeathed by Mrs. Willard Fiske. I had looked forward to



the development of the great library for which it provided as the



culminating event in my administration, and, indeed, as the



beginning of a better era in American scholarship. Never in the



history of the United States had so splendid a bequest been made



for such a purpose. But as I heard the argument I was satisfied



that our cause was lost,--and simply from the want of effective



champions; that this great opportunity for the institution which



I loved better than my life had passed from us during my



lifetime, at least; and then it was that I determined to break



from my surroundings for a time, and to seek new scenes which



might do something to change the current of my thoughts.







At the end of June, taking with me my nephew, a bright and active



college youth, I sailed for Glasgow, and, revisiting the scenes



made beautiful to me by Walter Scott, I was at last able to think



of something beside the sorrow and disappointment which had beset



me. Memorable to me still is a sermon heard at the old Church of



St. Giles, in Edinburgh. The text was, "He wist not that his face



shone," and the argument, while broad and liberal, was deeply



religious. One thought struck me forcibly. The preacher likened



theological controversies to storms on the coast which result



only in heaps of sand, while he compared religious influences to



the dew and gentle rains which beautify the earth and fructify



it.







Healing in their influences upon me were visits to the cathedral



towns between Edinburgh and London. The atmosphere of Durham,



York, Lincoln, Ely, Peterborough, aided to lift me out of my



depression. In each I stayed long enough to attend the cathedral



service and to enjoy the architecture, the music, and my



recollections of previous visits. At Lichfield Cathedral I heard



Bach's "Easter Hymn" given beautifully,--and it was needed to



make up for the sermon of a colonial bishop who, having returned



to England after a long stay in his remote diocese, was fearfully



depressed by the liberal tendencies of English theology. His



discourse was one long diatribe against the tendency in England



toward broad-churchmanship. One passage had rather a comical



effect. He told, pathetically, the story of a servant-girl



waiting on the table of the late Archbishop of Canterbury, who,



after hearing the clergymen present dealing somewhat freely with



the doctrine of the Trinity, rushed out into the passage and



recited loudly the Nicene Creed to strengthen her faith. I, too,



felt the need of doing something to strengthen mine after this



tirade, and fortunately strolled across the meadows to the little



Church of St. Chad, and there took part in a lovely "Flower



Service," ended by a very sweet, kindly sermon to the children



from the fatherly old rector of the parish. Nothing could be



better in its way, and it took the taste of the morning sermon



out of my mouth.







Of various experiences in London, the one of most interest to me



was a visit to the House of Commons, where the Irish Home Rulers



were attempting to bait Mr. Balfour, the government leader. One



after another they arose and attacked him bitterly in all the



moods and tenses, with alleged facts, insinuations, and



denunciations. Nothing could be better than his way of taking it



all. He sat quietly, looking at his enemies with a placid smile,



and then, when they were fully done, rose, and before he had



spoken five minutes his reply had the effect of a musket-shot



upon a bubble. It was evident that these patriots were hardly



taken seriously even by their own side, and, in fact, did not



take themselves seriously. I then realized as never before the



real reasons why the oratorical and other demonstrations of Irish



leaders have accomplished so little for their country.







A Liberal political meeting in Holborn also interested me. The



main speaker was the son of the Marquis of Northampton, Earl



Compton, who was standing for Parliament. His speech was all



good, but its best point was his answer to a man in the crowd who



asked him if he was prepared to vote for the abolition of the



House of Lords. That would seem a trying question to the heir of



a marquisate; but he answered instantly and calmly: "As to the



House of Lords, better try first to mend it, and, if we cannot



mend it, end it."







He was followed by a Home Ruler, Father McFadden, whose speech,



being simply anti-British rant from end to end, must have cost



many votes; and I was not surprised when, a day or two afterward,



his bishop recalled him to Ireland.







Very pleasing to me were sundry excursions. At Rugby I was



intensely interested in the scenes of Arnold's activity. He had



exercised a great influence over my own life, and a new



inspiration came amid the scenes so familiar to him, and



especially in the chapel where he preached.







Visiting some old friends in Hampshire, I drove with them to



Selborne, stood by the grave of Gilbert White, and sat in his



charming old house in that beautiful place of pilgrimage.







Most soothing in its effect upon me was a visit to Stoke Pogis



churchyard and the grave of Thomas Gray. The "Elegy" has never



since my boyhood lost its hold upon me, and my feelings of love



for its author were deepened as I read the inscription placed by



him upon his mother's monument:







"The tender mother of many children, only one of whom had the



misfortune to survive her."







A Sunday afternoon in Kensal Green cemetery, with a visit to the



graves of Thackeray, Thomas Hood, and Leigh Hunt, roused thoughts



on many things.







Somewhat later, revisiting Mr. Halliwell-Phillips's "Bungalow" at



Brighton, I met at his table the most bitter and yet one of the



most just of all critics of Carlyle whom I have ever known. He



spoke especially of Carlyle's treatment of his main historical



authorities,--many of them admirable and excellent men,--and



dwelt on the fact that Carlyle, having used the results of the



life-work of these scholars, then enjoyed pouring contempt and



ridicule over them; he also referred to Carlyle's address to the



Scotch students, in which he told them to study the patents of



nobility for the deeds which made the nobility of England great,



but did not reveal to them the fact that the expressions in these



patents were stereotyped, and the same, during many years, for



men of the most different qualities and services.







Running up to Cambridge for a day or two, and dining with Oscar



Browning at King's College, I afterward saw at his rooms a



collection of intensely interesting papers, and, among others,



reports of British spies during the Revolutionary War in America.



Very curious, among these, was a letter from the British minister



at Berlin in those days, who detailed a burglary which he had



caused in that capital in order to obtain the papers of the



American envoy and copies of American despatches. The



correspondence also showed that Frederick the Great was much



vexed at the whole matter; that the British ministry at home



thought their envoy too enterprising; that he came near



resigning; but that the whole matter finally blew over. This was



brought back to me somewhat later at a dinner of the Royal



Historical Society, where the president, Lord Aberdare, recalled



a story bearing on this matter. It was that Frederick the Great



and the British minister at his court greatly disliked each



other, and that on their meeting one day the old King asked, "Who



is this Hyder Ali who is making you British so much trouble in



India?" to which the bold Briton answered: "Sire, he is only an



old tyrant who, after robbing his neighbors, is now falling into



his dotage" ("Sire, ce n'est qu'un vieux tyran qui, apres avoir



pille ses voisins, commence a radoter").







Having made with my nephew a rapid excursion on the Continent, up



the Rhine, and as far as Munich, I returned to see him off on his



return journey to America, and then settled down for several



weeks in London. It was in the early autumn, Parliament had



adjourned, most people of note had left town, and I was left to



myself as completely as if I had been in the depths of a forest.



Looking out over Trafalgar Square from my pleasant rooms at



Morley's Hotel, with all the hurry and bustle of a great city



going on beneath my window, I was simply a hermit, and now found



myself able to resume the work which for so many years had



occupied my leisure. At the British Museum I enjoyed the



wonderful opportunities there given for investigation; and there,



too, I found an admirable helper in certain lines of work--my



friend Professor Hudson, since of Stanford University,



California.







The only place where I was at all in touch with the outside world



was at the Athenaeum Club; but the main attraction there was the



library.







Now came a sudden change in all my plans. My health having



weakened somewhat under the influence of this rather sedentary



life in the London fog, I consulted two eminent physicians, Sir



Andrew Clarke and Sir Morell Mackenzie, and each advised and even



urged me to pass the winter in Egypt. Shortly came a letter from



my friend Professor Willard Fiske, at Florence saying that he



would be glad to go with me. This was indeed a piece of good



fortune, for he had visited Egypt again and again, and was not



only the best of guides, but the most charming of companions. My



decision was instantly taken, and, having finished one or two



chapters of my book, I left London and, by the way of the St



Gotthard, soon reached Florence. Thence to Rome, Naples, and,



after a charming drive, to Castellammare, Sorrento, Amalfi, and



Salerno, whence we went by rail to Brindisi, and thence to



Alexandria, where we arrived on the 1st of January, 1889.







Now came a new chapter in my life. This journey in the East,



especially in Egypt and Greece, marked a new epoch in my



thinking. I became more and more impressed with the continuity of



historical causes, and realized more and more how easily and



naturally have grown the myths and legends which have delayed the



unbiased observation of human events and the scientific



investigation of natural laws. On a Nile boat for many weeks,



with scholars of high character, and with an excellent library



about me, I found not only a refuge from trouble and sorrow, but



a portal to new and most fascinating studies.







Nor was it only the life of old Egypt which interested me: the



scenes in modern Eastern life also gave a needed change in my



environment. At Cairo, in the bazaar in contact with the daily



life, which seemed like a chapter out of the "Arabian Nights,"



and also in the modern part of the city, in contact with the



newer life of Egypt among English and Egyptian functionaries,



there was constant stimulus to fruitful trains of thought.







For our journey of five weeks upon the Nile we had what was



called a "special steamer," the Sethi; and for our companions,



some fourteen Americans and English--all on friendly terms. Every



day came new subjects of thought, and nearly every waking moment



came some new stimulus to observation and reflection.







Deeply impressed on my mind is the account given me by Brugsch



Bey, assistant director of the Egyptian Museum, of the amazing



find of antiquities two or three years before--perhaps the most



startling discovery ever made in archaeology. It was on this



wise. The museum authorities had for some time noted that



tourists coming down the river were bringing remarkably beautiful



specimens of ancient workmanship; and this led to a suspicion



that the Arabs about the first cataract had discovered a new



tomb. For a long time nothing definite could be found; but, at



last, vigorous measures having been taken,--measures which



Brugsch Bey did not explain, but which I could easily understand



to be the time-honored method of tying up the principal



functionaries of the region to their palm-trees and whipping them



until they confessed,--the discovery was revealed, and Brugsch



Bey, having gone up the Nile to the place indicated, was taken to



what appeared to be a well; and, having been let down into it by



ropes, found himself in a sort of artificial cavern, not



beautified and adorned like the royal tombs of that region, but



roughly hewn in the rock. It was filled with sarcophagi, and at



first sight of them he was almost paralyzed. For they bore the



names of several among the most eminent early sovereigns and



members of sovereign families of the greatest days of Egypt. The



first idea which took hold of Brugsch's mind while stunned by



this revelation was that he was dreaming; but, having soon



convinced himself that he was awake, he then thought that he must



be in some state of hallucination after death--that he had



suddenly lost his life, and that his soul was wandering amid



shadows. But this, too, he soon found unlikely. Then came over



him a sense of the reality and importance of the discovery too



oppressive to be borne. He could stay in the cavern no longer;



and, having gone to the entrance of the well and signaled to the



men above, he was drawn up, and, arriving at the surface, gasped



out a command to them all to leave him. He then sat down in the



desert to secure the calm required for further thought; and,



finally, having become more composed, returned to the work, and



the mummies of Rameses the Great and of the other royal



personages were taken from their temporary home, carried down the



river, and placed in the museum at Cairo.







Another experience was of a very different sort. I had passed a



day with the Egyptian minister of public instruction, Artin



Pasha, at the great technical school of Cairo, which, under the



charge of an eminent French engineer, is training admirably a



considerable number of Egyptians in various arts applied to



industry; and at luncheon, I had noticed on the wall a portrait



of the Khedive, Tewfik Pasha, representing him as most commanding



in manner--over six feet in height, and in a gorgeous uniform. On



the evening of that day I went to dine with the Khedive, and,



entering the reception-rooms, found a large assemblage, and was



welcomed by a kindly little man with a pleasant face, and in the



plainest of uniforms, who, as I supposed, was the prime minister,



Riaz Pasha. His greeting was cordial, and we were soon in close



conversation, I giving him especially the impressions made upon



me by the school, asking questions and making suggestions. He



entered very heartily into it all, and detained me long, I



wondering constantly where the Khedive might be. Presently, the



great doors having been flung open and dinner announced, each



gentleman hastened to the lady assigned him, and all marched out



together, my thought being, "This is the Oriental way of



entertaining strangers; we shall, no doubt, find the sovereign on



his throne at the table." But, to my amazement, the first place



at the table was taken by the unassuming little man with whom I



had been talking so freely. At first I was somewhat abashed,



though the mistake was a very natural one. The fact was that I



had been completely under the impression made upon me by the



idealized portrait of the Khedive at the technical school, and



the thought had never entered my mind that the real Khedive might



be physically far inferior to the ideal. But no harm was done;



for, after dinner, he came to me again and renewed the



conversation with especial cordiality. I also had a long talk



with the real Riaz, and found him intelligent and broad-minded.



One thing he said amused me. It was that he especially liked to



welcome Americans, because they were not seeking to exploit the



country.







In Cairo and Alexandria I enjoyed meeting the American and



English missionaries,--among them my old Yale friend Dr. Henry



Jessup, who has for so many years rendered admirable services at



Beyrout; but the most noteworthy thing was a lecture which I



heard from Dr. Grant, an eminent Presbyterian physician connected



with the mission. It was on the subject of the Egyptian



Trinities. The doctor explained them, as well as the Trimurtis of



India, by expressing his belief that when the Almighty came down



in the cool of the day to refresh himself by walking and talking



with Adam in the garden of Eden, he revealed to the man he had



made some of the great mysteries of the divine existence, and



that these had "leaked out" to men who took them into other



countries, and there taught them!







I also found at Cairo another especially interesting man of a



very different sort, an Armenian, Mr. Nimr; and, on visiting him,



was amazed to find in his library a large collection of English



and French books, scientific and literary--among them the "New



York Scientific Monthly" containing my own articles, which he had



done me the honor to read. I found that he had been, at an



earlier period, a professor at the college established by the



American Protestant missionaries at Beyrout; but that he and



several others who had come to adopt the Darwinian hypothesis



were on that account turned out of their situations, and that he



had taken refuge in Cairo where he was publishing, in Arabic, a



daily newspaper a weekly literary magazine, and a monthly



scientific journal. I was much struck by one remark of his--which



was, that he was doing his best to promote the interests of



Freemasonry in the East, as the only means of bringing Christians



and Mohammedans together under the same roof for mutual help,



with the feeling that they were children of the same God. He told



me that the worst opposition he had met came from a very



excellent Protestant missionary, who had publicly insisted that



the God worshiped by the Mohammedans was not the God worshiped by



Christians. This reminded me of a sermon which one of my friends



heard in Strasburg Cathedral in which a priest, reproving his



Catholic hearers for entering into any relations with



Protestants, especially opposed the idea that they worshiped the



same God, and insisted that the God of the Catholics and the God



of the Protestants are two different beings.







Among the things which gave me a real enjoyment at this period,



and aided to revive my interest in the world about me, was the



Saracenic architecture of Cairo and its neighborhood. Nothing



could be, in its way, more beautiful. I had never before realized



how much beauty is obtainable under the limitations of



Mohammedanism; the exquisite tracery and fretwork of the



Saracenic period were a constant joy to me, and happily, as there



had been no "restorers," everything remained as it had left the



hands of the men of genius who created it.







In this older architecture a thousand things interested me; but



the greatest effect was produced by the tombs at Beni Hassan, as



showing the historical linking together of human ideas both in



art and science--the development of one period out of another. Up



to the time of my seeing them I had supposed that the Doric



architecture of Greece, and especially the Doric column, was of



Greek creation; now I saw the proof that it was evolved out of an



earlier form upon the lower Nile, which had itself, doubtless,



been developed out of forms yet earlier.







At one thing I was especially surprised. I found that, excellent



as are our missionaries in those regions, their work has not at



all been what those who send them have supposed. No Mohammedan



converts are made. Indeed, should the good missionaries at Cairo



wake up some fine morning in the spacious quarters for which they



are so largely indebted to the late Khedive Ismail, and find that



they had converted a Mohammedan, they would be filled with



consternation. They would possibly be driven from the country.



The real Mohammedan cannot be converted. There were, indeed, a



few persons, here and there, claiming to be converted Jews or



Mohammedans; but we were always warned against them, even by



Christians, as far less trustworthy than those who were true to



their original faith. Whatever good is done by the missionaries



is done through their schools, to which come many children of the



Copts, with perhaps a certain number of Mohammedans desirous of



learning English; and the greatest of American missionary



successes is doubtless Robert College at Constantinople, which



has certainly done a very noble work among the more gifted young



men of the Christian populations in the Turkish Empire.







Several times I attended service in the United Presbyterian



church at Cairo, and found it hard, unattractive, and little



likely to influence any considerable number of persons, whether



Mohammedan or Christian. It was evident that the preachers, as a



rule, were entirely out of the current of modern theological and



religious thought, and that even the best and noblest of them



represented ideas no longer held by their leading coreligionists



in the countries from which they came.







After a stay of three months in Egypt, we left Alexandria for



Athens, where I enjoyed, during a considerable stay, the



advantages of the library at the American School of Archaeology,



and the companionship of my friend Professor Waldstein, now of



Cambridge University. Very delightful also were excursions with



my old Yale companion, Walker Fearne, our minister in Greece, and



his charming family, to the Acropolis, the Theater of Dionysus,



the Bay of Salamis, Megara, and other places of interest. An



especial advantage we had in the companionship of Professor



Mahaffy of Trinity College, Dublin, whose comments on all these



places were most suggestive.







Very interesting to me was an interview with Tricoupis, the prime



minister of the kingdom. His talk on the condition of things in



Greece was that of a broad-minded statesman. Speaking of the



relations of the Greek Church to the state, he said that the



church had kept the language and the nationality of the people



alive during the Turkish occupation, but that, in spite of its



services, it had never been allowed to domineer over the country



politically; he dwelt on the importance of pushing railway



communications into Europe, and lamented the obstacles thrown in



their way by Turkey. His reminiscences of Mr. Buchanan and Mr.



Dallas, whom he had formerly known at the Court of St. James



during his stay as minister in London, were especially



interesting.







The most important "function" I saw was the solemn "Te Deum" at



the cathedral on the anniversary of Greek independence, the King,



Queen, and court being present, but I was less impressed by their



devotion than by the irreverence of a considerable part of the



audience, who, at the close of the service, walked about in the



church with their hats on their heads. As to the priests who



swarmed about us in their Byzantine costumes and long hair, I was



reminded of a sententious Moslem remark regarding them: "Much



hair, little brains."







On Good Friday I visited Mars Hill and mused for an hour over



what has come from the sermon once preached there.







Toward the end of April we left the Piraeus, and, after passing



through the aegean on a most beautiful day, arrived in



Constantinople, where I made the acquaintance of Mr. Straus, our



minister at that capital. Thus began a friendship which I have



ever since greatly prized. Mr. Straus introduced me to two of the



most interesting men I have ever met; the first of these being



Hamdi Bey, director of the Imperial Museum at Constantinople.



Meeting him at Mr. Straus's table and in his own house, I heard



him discuss sundry questions relating to modern art--better, in



some respects, than any other person I have ever known. Never



have I heard more admirably discriminating judgments upon various



modern schools of painting than those which he then gave me.







The other person to whom Mr. Straus introduced me was the British



ambassador, Sir William White, who was very hospitable, and



revealed to me much in life and literature. One thing especially



surprised me--namely, that though a Roman Catholic, he had a



great admiration for Renan's writings, of which he was a constant



reader. Here, too, I renewed my acquaintance with various members



of the diplomatic corps whom I had met elsewhere. Curious was an



evening visit to the Russian Embassy, Mrs. Straus being carried



in a sedan-chair, her husband walking beside her in evening dress



at one door, I at the other, and a kavass, with drawn sword,



marching at the head of the procession.







While the Mohammedan history revealed in Constantinople gave me



frequent subjects of thought, I was more constantly carried back



to the Byzantine period. For there was the Church of St. Sophia!



No edifice has ever impressed me more; indeed, in many respects,



none has ever impressed me so much. Bearing in mind its origin,



its history, and its architecture, it is doubtless the most



interesting church in the world. Though smaller than St. Peter's



at Rome, it is vastly more impressive. Taking into account the



view as one enters, embracing the lofty vaults retreating on all



sides, the arches springing above our heads, and, crowning all,



the dome, which opens fully upon the sight immediately upon



passing the door way, it is certainly the most overpowering of



Christian churches. Gibbon's pictures thronged upon me, and very



vividly, as I visited the ground where formerly stood the Great



Circus, and noted the remains of monuments where the "Blues" and



"Greens" convulsed the city with their bloody faction fights, and



where squabbling Christian sects prepared the way for that



Turkish dominion which has now burdened this weary earth for more



than five hundred years.







From Constantinople, by Buda-Pesth, Vienna, Munich, Ulm, and



Frankfort-on-the-Main, to Paris, stopping in each of these



cities, mainly for book-hunting. At Munich I spent considerable



time in the Royal Library, where various rare works relating to



the bearing of theology on civilization were placed at my



disposal; and at Frankfort added largely to my



library--especially monographs on Egypt and illuminated



manuscripts of the middle ages.







At Paris the Exposition of 1889 was in full blast. As to the



American exhibit, there were some things to be lamented. Our



"commission of experts" was in part remarkably well chosen; among



them being a number of the best men in their departments that



America has produced; but, on the other hand, there were some who



had evidently been foisted upon the President by politicians in



remote States--so-called "experts," yet as unfit as it is



possible to conceive any human beings to be. One of these, who



was responsible for one of the most important American



departments, was utterly helpless. Day in and day out, he sat in



a kind of daze at the American headquarters, doing



nothing--indeed, evidently incapable of doing anything. One or



two of his associates, as well as sundry Frenchmen, asked me to



aid in getting his department into some order; and this, though



greatly pressed for time, I did,--devoting to the task several



days which I could ill afford.







Very happy was I over one improvement which the United States had



made since the former exposition, at which I had myself been a



commissioner. Then all lamented and apologized for the condition



of the American Art Gallery; now there was no need either of



lamentation or apology, for there, in all their beauty, were



portraits by Sargent, and Gari Melchers's picture of "A Communion



Day in Holland"--the latter touching the deep places of the human



heart. As I was sitting before it one day, an English gentleman



came with his wife and sat beside me. Presently I heard him say:



"Of all the pictures in the entire exposition, this takes the



strongest hold upon me." Many other American pictures were also



objects of pride to us. I found our minister, Mr. Whitelaw Reid,



very hospitable, and at his house became acquainted with various



interesting Americans. At President Carnot's reception at the



palace of the Elysee I also met several personages worth knowing,



and among them, to my great satisfaction, Senator John Sherman.







During this stay in Paris I took part in two commemorations.



First came the Fourth of July, when, in obedience to the old



custom which I had known so well in my student days, the American



colony visited the cemetery of the Rue Picpus and laid wreaths



upon the tomb of Lafayette,--the American band performing a



dirge, and our marines on duty firing a farewell volley. It was



in every way a warm and hearty tribute. A week later was the



unveiling of the statue of Camille Desmoulins in the garden of



the Palais Royal,--this being the one-hundredth anniversary of



the day on which, in that garden,--and, indeed, on that spot,



before the Cafe Foy,--he had roused the mob which destroyed the



Bastille and begun the whirlwind which finally swept away so much



and so many, including himself and his beloved Lucille. Poor



Camille, orating, gesticulating, and looking for a new heaven and



a new earth, was one of the little great men so important at the



beginning of revolutions and so insignificant afterward. It was



evident that, in spite of the old legends regarding him, the



French had ceased to care for him; I was surprised at the small



number present, and at the languid interest even of these.







Among my most delightful reminiscences of this period are my



walks and talks with my old Yale and Paris student friend of



nearly forty years before, Randall Gibson, who, having been a



general in the Confederate service, was now a United States



senator from Louisiana. Revisiting our old haunts, especially the



Sorbonne, the Pantheon, St. Sulpice, and other monuments of the



Latin Quarter, we spoke much of days gone by, he giving me most



interesting reminiscences of our Civil War period as seen from



the Southern side. One or two of the things he told me are



especially fastened in my mind. The first was that as he sat with



other officers over the camp-fire night after night, discussing



the war and their hopes regarding the future, all agreed that



when the Confederacy obtained its independence there should be no



"right of secession" in it. But what interested me most was the



fact that he, a Democratic senator of the United, States,



absolutely detested Thomas Jefferson, and, above all things, for



the reason that he considered Jefferson the real source of the



extreme doctrine of State sovereignty. Gibson was a typical



Kentucky Whig who, in the Civil War, went with the South from the



force of family connections, friendships, social relations, and



the like, but who remained, in his heart of hearts, from first to



last, deeply attached to the Union.







Leaving Paris, we went together to Homburg, and there met Mr.



Henry S. Sanford, our minister at Belgium during the Civil War,



one of Secretary Seward's foremost agents on the European



continent at that period. His accounts of matters at that time,



especially of the doings of sundry emissaries of the United



States, were all of them interesting, and some of them



exceedingly amusing. At Homburg, too, I found my successor in the



legation at Berlin, Mr. Pendleton, who, though his mind remained



clear, was slowly dying of paralysis.







Thence with Gibson and Sanford down the Rhine to Mr. Sanford's



country-seat in Belgium. It was a most beautiful place, a lordly



chateau, superbly built, fitted, and furnished, ample for the



accommodation of a score of guests, and yet the rent he paid for



it was but six hundred dollars a year. It had been built by a



prince at such cost that he himself could not afford to live in



it, and was obliged to rent it for what he could get. Thence we



made our way to London and New York.















CHAPTER LV







MEXICO, CALIFORNIA, SCANDINAVIA, RUSSIA, ITALY, LONDON, AND



BERLIN--1892-1897







Arriving at New York in the autumn of 1889, I was soon settled at



my accustomed work in the university,--devoting myself to new



chapters of my book and to sundry courses of lectures. Early in



the following year I began a course before the University of



Pennsylvania; and my stay in Philadelphia was rendered very



agreeable by various new acquaintances. Interesting to me was the



Roman Catholic archbishop, Dr. Ryan. Dining in his company, I



referred admiringly to his cathedral, which I had recently



visited, but spoke of what seemed to me the defective mode of



placing the dome upon the building; whereupon he made one of the



most tolerable Latin puns I have ever heard, saying that during



the construction of both the nave and the dome his predecessors



were hampered by lack of money,--that, in fact, they were greatly



troubled by the res angustae domi. Interesting also was



attendance upon the conference at Lake Mohonk, which brought



together a large body of leading men from all parts of the



country to discuss the best methods of dealing with questions



relating to the freedmen and Indians. The president of the



conference, Mr. Hayes, formerly President of the United States, I



had known well in former days, when I served under him as



minister to Germany, and the high opinion I had then formed of



him was increased as I heard him discuss the main questions



before the conference. It was the fashion at one time among



blackguards and cynics of both parties to sneer at him, and this,



doubtless, produced some effect on the popular mind; but nothing



could be more unjust: rarely have I met a man in our own or any



other country who has impressed me more by the qualities which a



true American should most desire in a President of the United



States; he had what our country needs most in our public



men--sobriety of judgment united to the power of calm, strong



statement.







The two following years, 1890-1891, were passed mainly at



Cornell, though with excursions to various other institutions



where I had been asked to give addresses or lectures; but in



February of 1892, having been invited to lecture at Stanford



University in California, I accepted an invitation from Mr.



Andrew Carnegie to become one of the guests going in his car to



the Pacific coast by way of Mexico. Our party of eight, provided



with cook, servants, and every comfort, traveled altogether more



than twelve thousand miles--first through the Central and



Southern States of the Union, thence to the city of Mexico and



beyond, then by a series of zigzag excursions from lower



California to the northern limits of Oregon and Washington, and



finally through the Rocky Mountains and the canons of Colorado to



Salt Lake City and Denver. Thence my companions went East and I



returned alone to Stanford to give my lectures. During this long



excursion I met many men who greatly interested me, and



especially old students of mine whom I found everywhere doing



manfully the work for which Cornell had aided to fit them. Never



have I felt more fully repaid for any labor and care I have ever



given to the founding and development of the university. Arriving



in the city of Mexico, I said to myself, "Here certainly I shall



not meet any more of my old Cornellians"; but hardly was I



settled in my room when a card came up from one of them, and I



soon learned that he was doing honor to the Sibley College of the



university by superintending the erection of the largest



printing-press which had ever been brought into Mexico. The



Mexican capital interested me greatly. The cathedral, which, up



to that time, I had supposed to be in a debased rococo style, I



found to be of a simple, noble Renaissance character, and of real



dignity. Being presented to the President, Porfirio Diaz, I was



greatly impressed by his quiet strength and self-possession, and



then understood for the first time what had wrought so beneficent



a change in his country. His ministers also impressed me



favorably, though they were evidently overshadowed by so great a



personality. One detail struck me as curious: the room in which



the President received us at the palace was hung round with satin



draperies stamped with the crown and cipher of his



predecessor--the ill-fated Emperor Maximilian.







California was a great revelation to me. We arrived just at the



full outburst of spring, and seemed to have alighted upon a new



planet. Strong and good men I found there, building up every sort



of worthy enterprise, and especially their two noble



universities, one of which was almost entirely officered by



Cornell graduates. To this institution I was attached by a



special tie. At various times the founders, Governor and Mrs.



Stanford, had consulted me on problems arising in its



development; they had twice visited me at Cornell for the purpose



of more full discussion, and at the latter of the two visits had



urged me to accept its presidency. This I had felt obliged to



decline. I said to them that the best years of my life had been



devoted to building up two universities,--Michigan and



Cornell,--and that not all the treasures of the Pacific coast



would tempt me to begin with another; that this feeling was not



due to a wish to evade any duty, but to a conviction that my work



of that sort was done, and that there were others who could



continue it far better than I. It was after this conversation



that, on their asking whether there was any one suitable within



my acquaintance, I answered, "Go to the University of Indiana;



there you will find the president, an old student of mine, David



Starr Jordan, one of the leading scientific men of the country,



possessed of a most charming power of literary expression, with a



remarkable ability in organization, and blessed with good, sound



sense. Call him." They took my advice, called Dr. Jordan, and I



found him at the university. My three weeks' stay interested me



more and more. Evening after evening I walked through the



cloisters of the great quadrangle, admiring the solidity, beauty,



and admirable arrangement of the buildings, and enjoying their



lovely surroundings and the whole charm of that California



atmosphere.







The buildings, in simplicity, beauty, and fitness, far surpassed



any others which had at that time been erected for university



purposes in the United States; and I feel sure that when the



entire plan is carried out, not even Oxford or Cambridge will



have anything more beautiful. President Jordan had more than



fulfilled my prophecies, and it was an inspiration to see at



their daily work the faculty he had called together. The students



also greatly interested me. When it was first noised abroad that



Senator Stanford was to found a new university in California,



sundry Eastern men took a sneering tone and said, "What will it



find to do? The young men on the Pacific coast who are as yet fit



to receive the advantages of a university are very few; the State



University of California at Berkeley is already languishing for



want of students." The weakness of these views is seen in the



fact that, at this hour, each of these universities has nearly



three thousand undergraduates. The erection of Stanford has given



an impetus to the State University, and both are doing noble



work, not only for the Pacific coast, but for the whole country.



One of the most noteworthy things in the history of American



university education thus far is the fact that the university



buildings erected by boards of trustees in all parts of the



country have, almost without exception, proved to be mere jumbles



of mean materials in incongruous styles; but to this rule there



have been, mainly, two noble exceptions: one in the buildings of



the University of Virginia, planned and executed under the eye of



Thomas Jefferson, and the other in these buildings at Palo Alto,



planned and executed under the direction of Governor and Mrs.



Stanford. These two groups, one in Virginia and one in



California, with, perhaps, the new university buildings at



Philadelphia and Chicago, are almost the only homes of learning



in the United States which are really satisfactory from an



architectural point of view.







The "City of the Saints," which I saw on my way, had much



interest for me. I collected while there everything possible in



the way of publications bearing on Mormonism, beginning with a



copy of the original edition of the "Book of Mormon"; but nothing



that I could find in any of these publications indicated any



considerable intellectual development, as yet.







More encouraging was a rapid visit, on my way home, to the



Chicago Exposition buildings, which, though not yet fully



completed, were very beautiful; and still more pleasure came from



a visit to the new University of Chicago, which was evidently



beginning a most important work for American civilization. Its



whole plan is remarkably well conceived, and with the means that



it is rapidly accumulating, due to the public spirit of its main



benefactor and a multitude of others hardly second to him in the



importance of their gifts, it cannot fail to exercise a great



influence, especially throughout the Northwestern States. First



of all, it will do much to lift the city in which it stands out



of its crude materialism into something higher and better. It is



a pleasure to note that its buildings are worthy of it: they seem



likely to form a fourth in the series of fit homes for great



centers of advanced education in the United States,--Virginia,



Stanford, and the University of Pennsylvania being the others.







Having returned to Cornell, I went on quietly with my work until



autumn, when, to my surprise, I received notice that the



President had appointed me minister to St. Petersburg; and on the



4th of November I arrived at my post in that capital. Of my



experience as minister I have spoken elsewhere, but have given no



account of two journeys which interested me at that period. The



first of these was in the Scandinavian countries. The voyage of a



day and night across the Baltic through the Aland Islands was



like a dream, the northern twilight making night more beautiful



than day, and the approach to the Swedish capital being, next to



the approaches to Constantinople and to New York, the most



beautiful I know.







Very instructive to me was a visit to Upsala--especially to the



university and cathedral. As to the former, the "Codex of



Ulfilas," in the library, which I had long desired to see,



especially interested me; and visits to the houses of the various



"nations" showed me that out of the social needs of Swedish



students in the middle ages had been developed something closely



akin to the fraternity houses which similar needs have developed



in our time at American universities. The cathedral, containing



the remains of Gustavus Vasa and Linnaeus, was fruitful in



suggestions. By a curious coincidence I was at that time



finishing my chapter entitled "From Creation to Evolution," and



had been paying special attention to the ancient and mediaeval



conceptions of the creation of the world as a work done by an



individual in human form, laboring with his hands during six



days, and taking needed rest on the seventh; and here I found, at



the side entrance of the cathedral, a delightfully naive



mediaeval representation of the whole process,--a series of



medallions representing the Almighty toiling like an artisan on



each of the six days and reposing, evidently very weary, on the



seventh.







The journey across Sweden, through the canals and lakes, was very



restful. At Christiania Mr. Gade, the American consul, who had



served our country so long and so honorably in that city, took me



under his guidance during various interesting excursions about



the fiords. At Gothenburg I took pains to obtain information



regarding their system of dealing with the sale of intoxicating



liquors, and became satisfied that it is, on the whole, the best



solution of the problem ever obtained. The whole old system of



saloons, gin-shops, and the like, with their allurements to the



drinking of adulterated alcohol, had been swept away, and in its



place the government had given to a corporation the privilege of



selling pure liquors in a restricted number of decent shops,



under carefully devised limitations. First, the liquors must be



fully tested for purity; secondly, none could be sold to persons



already under the influence of drink; thirdly, no intoxicant



could be sold without something to eat with it, the effects of



alcohol upon the system being thus mitigated. These and other



restrictions had reduced the drink evil, as I was assured, to a



minimum. But the most far-reaching provision in the whole system



was that the company which enjoyed the monopoly of this trade was



not allowed to declare a dividend greater than, I believe, six



per cent.; everything realized above this going into the public



treasury, mainly for charitable purposes. The result of this



restriction of profits was that no person employed in selling



ardent spirits was under the slightest temptation to attract



customers. Each of these sellers was a salaried official and knew



that his place depended on his adhering to the law which forbade



him to sell to any person already under the influence of liquor,



or to do anything to increase his sales; and the whole motive for



making men drunkards was thus taken away.







I was assured by both the American and British consuls, as well



as by most reputable citizens, that this system had greatly



diminished intemperance. Unfortunately, since that time, fanatics



have obtained control, and have passed an entirely "prohibitory"



law, with the result, as I understand, that the community is now



discovering that prohibition does not prohibit, and that the



worst kinds of liquors are again sold by men whose main motive is



to sell as much as possible.







The most attractive feature in my visit to Norway was Throndheim.



With my passion for Gothic architecture, the beautiful little



cathedral, which the authorities were restoring Judiciously, was



a delight, and it was all the more interesting as containing one



of those curiosities of human civilization which have now become



rare. In one corner of the edifice is a "holy well," the



pilgrimages to which in the middle ages were, no doubt, a main



source of the wealth of the establishment. The attendant shows,



in the stonework close to the well, the end of a tube coming from



the upper part of the cathedral; and through this tube pious



monks in the middle ages no doubt spoke oracular words calculated



to enhance the authority of the saint presiding over the place.



It was the same sort of thing which one sees in the Temple of



Isis at Pompeii, and the zeal which created it was no doubt the



same that to-day originates the sacred fire which always comes



down from heaven on Easter day into the Greek church at



Jerusalem, the liquefaction of the blood of St. Januarius in the



cathedral at Naples, and sundry camp-meeting utterances and



actions in the United States.







Sweden and Norway struck me as possessing, in some respects, the



most satisfactory civilization of modern times. With a



monarchical figurehead, they are really a republic. Here is no



overbearing plutocracy, no squalid poverty, an excellent system



of education, liberal and practical, from the local school to the



university, a population, to all appearance, healthy, thrifty,



and comfortable.







And yet here, as in other parts of the world, the resources of



human folly are illimitable. A large party in Norway urges



secession from Sweden, and both remain divided from Denmark,



though the three are, to all intents and purposes, of the same



race, religion, language, and early historical traditions. And



close beside them looms up, more and more portentous, the Russian



colossus, which, having trampled Swedish Finland under its feet,



is looking across the Scandinavian peninsula toward the good



harbors of Norway, just opposite Great Britain. Russia has



declared the right of her one hundred and twenty millions of



people to an ice-free port on the Pacific; why shall she not



assert, with equal cogency, the right of these millions to an



ice-free port on the Atlantic? Why should not these millions own



a railway across Scandinavia, and a suitable territory along the



line; and then, logically, all the territory north, and as much



as she needs of the territory south of the line? The northern



and, to some extent, the middle regions of Norway and Sweden



would thus come under the sway of a czar in St. Petersburg,



represented by some governor-general like those who have been



trying to show to the Scandinavians of Finland that newspapers



are useless, petitions inadmissible, constitutions a fetish,



banishment a blessing, and the use of their native language a



superfluity. The only sad thing in this fair prospect is that it



is not the objurgatory Bjornson, the philosophic Ibsen, and the



impulsive Nansen, with their compatriots, now groaning under what



they are pleased to call "Swedish tyranny," who would enjoy this



Russian liberty, but their children, and their children's



children.







At Copenhagen I was especially attracted by the Ethnographic



Museum, which, by its display of the gradual uplifting of



Scandinavian humanity from prehistoric times, has so strongly



aided in enforcing on the world the scientific doctrine of the



"rise of man," and in bringing to naught the theological doctrine



of the "fall of man."







A short stay at Moscow added to my Russian points of view, it



being my second visit after an interval of nearly forty years.



Although the city had spread largely, there was very little



evidence of real progress: everywhere were filth, fetishism,



beggary, and reaction. The monument to Alexander II, the great



emancipator, stood in the Kremlin, half finished; it has since, I



am glad to learn, been completed; but this has only been after



long and slothful delays, and the statue in St. Petersburg has



not even been begun. It is well understood that one cause of this



delay has been the reluctance of the reactionary leaders in the



empire to glorify so radical a movement as the emancipation of



the serfs.







I had one curious experience of Muscovite ideas of trade. Moscow



is one of the main centers for the manufacture of the church



bells in which the Russian peasant takes such delight; and, being



much interested in campanology, I visited several of the



principal foundries, and was delighted with the size and



workmanship of many specimens. Walking one morning to the



Kremlin, I saw at the agency of one of these establishments a



bell weighing about two hundred and fifty pounds, most



exquisitely wrought, and such a beautiful example of the best



that Russians can do in this respect that I went in and asked the



price of it. The price being named, I said that I would take it.



Thereupon consternation was evident in the establishment, and



presently the head of the concern said to me that they were not



sure that they wished to sell it. But I said, "You HAVE sold it;



I asked you what your price was, you told me, and I have bought



it." To this he demurred, and finally refused altogether to sell



it. On going out, my guide informed me that I had made a mistake;



that I was myself the cause of the whole trouble; that if I had



offered half the price named for the bell I should have secured



it for two thirds; but that, as I had offered the entire price,



the people in the shop had jumped to the conclusion that it must



be worth more than they had supposed, that I had detected values



in it which they had not realized, and that it was their duty to



make me pay more for it than the price they had asked. The result



was that, a few weeks afterward, a compromise having been made, I



bought it and sent it to the library of Cornell University, where



it is now both useful and ornamental.







The most interesting feature of this stay in Moscow was my



intercourse with Tolstoi, and to this I have devoted a separate



chapter.[14]











[14] See Chapter XXXVII.











One more experience may be noted. In coming and going on the



Moscow railway I found, as in other parts of Europe, that



governmental control of railways does not at all mean better



accommodations or lower fares than when such works are under



individual control. The prices for travel, as well as for



sleeping-berths, were much higher on these lines, owned by the



government, than on any of our main trunk-lines in America, which



are controlled by private corporations, and the accommodations



were never of a high order, and sometimes intolerable.







During this stay in Russia my sympathies were enlisted for



Finland; but on this subject I have spoken fully elsewhere.[15]











[15] See Chapter XXXIV.











Having resigned my position at St. Petersburg in October of 1894,



the first use I made of my liberty was to go with my family to



Italy for the winter; and several months were passed at Florence,



where I revised and finished the book which had been preparing



during twenty years. Then came a rapid run to Rome and through



southern Italy, my old haunts at Castellammare, Sorrento, and



Amalfi being revisited, and sundry new excursions made. Among



these last was one to Palermo, where I visited the Church of St.



Josaphat. This edifice greatly interested me as a Christian



church erected in honor of a Christian saint who was none other



than Buddha. The manner in which the founder of that great



world-religion which preceded our own was converted into a



Christian saint and solemnly proclaimed as such by a long series



of popes, from Sixtus V to Pius IX, inclusive, by virtue of their



infallibility in all matters relating to faith and morals, is one



of the most curious and instructive things in all history.[16]











[16] A full account of this conversion of Buddha (Bodisat) into



St. Josaphat is given, with authorities, etc. in my "History of



the Warfare of Science with Theology," Vol. II, pp. 381 et seq.











At first I had some difficulty in finding this church; but,



finally, having made the acquaintance of an eminent scholar, the



Commendatore Marzo, canon of the Cappella Palatina and director



of the National Library at Palermo he kindly took me to the



place. Over the entrance were the words, "Divo Josaphat"; within,



occupying one of the places of highest honor, was an altar to the



saint, and above it a statue representing him as a young prince



wearing a crown and holding a crucifix. By permission of the



authorities I was allowed to send a photographer, who took a



negative for me. A remark of the Commendatore Marzo upon the



subject pleased me much. When, one day, after showing me the



treasures of his great library, he was dining with me, and I



pressed him for particulars regarding St. Josaphat, he answered,



"He cannot be the Jehoshaphat of the Old Testament, for he is



represented as a very young man, and contemplating a crucifix: e



molto misterioso." It was, after all, not so very mysterious; for



in these later days, now that the "Life of Barlaam and Josaphat,"



which dates from monks of the sixth or seventh century, has been



compared with the "Life of Buddha," certainly written before the



Christian era, the constant coincidence in details, and even in



phrases, puts it beyond the slightest doubt that St. Josaphat and



Buddha are one and the same person.







Very suggestive to thought was a visit to the wonderful cathedral



of Monreale, above Palermo; for here, at this southern extreme of



Europe, I found a conception of the Almighty as an enlarged human



being, subject to human weakness, identical with that shown in



the sculptures upon the cathedral of Upsala, at the extreme north



of Europe. The whole interior of Monreale Cathedral is covered



with a vast sheet of mosaics dating from about the twelfth



century, and in one series of these, representing the creation,



the Almighty is shown as working, day after day, like an artisan,



and finally, on the seventh day, as "resting,"--seated in almost



the exact attitude of the "weary Mercury" of classic sculpture,



with a marked expression of fatigue upon his countenance and in



the whole disposition of his body.[17]











[17] I have given a more full discussion of this subject in my



"History of the Warfare of Science with Theology," Vol. I, p. 3.











During this journey, having revisited Orvieto, Perugia, and



Assisi, I returned to Florence, and again enjoyed the society of



my old friends, Professor Willard Fiske, Professor Villari, with



his accomplished wife, and Judge Stallo, former minister of the



United States in Rome.







The great event of this stay was an earthquake. Seated on a



pleasant April evening in my rooms at the house built by Adolphus



Trollope, near the Piazza dell' Independenza, I heard what seemed



at first the rising of a storm; then the rushing of a mighty



wind; then, as it grew stronger, apparently the gallop of a corps



of cavalry in the neighboring avenue; but, almost instantly, it



seemed to change into the onrush of a corps of artillery, and, a



moment later, to strike the house, lifting its foundations as if



by some mighty hand, and swaying it to and fro, everything



creaking, groaning, rattling, and seeming likely to fall in upon



us. This movement to and fro, with crashing and screaming inside



and outside the house, continued, as it seemed to me, about



twenty minutes--as a matter of fact, it lasted hardly seven



seconds; but certainly it was the longest seven seconds I have



ever known. At the first uplift of the seismic wave my wife and I



rose from our seats, I saying, "Stand perfectly still."



Thenceforward, not a word was uttered by either of us until all



was over; but many thoughts came,--the dominant feeling being a



sense of our helplessness in the presence of the great powers of



nature. Neither of us had any hope of escaping alive; but we



calmly accepted the inevitable, thinking each moment would be,



the last. As I look back, our resignation and perfect quiet still



surprise me. That room, at the corner of the Villino Trollope,



which an ill-founded legend makes the place where George Eliot



wrote "Romola," is to me sacred, as the place where we two passed



"from death unto life."







Nearly all that night we remained near the doors of the house,



ready to escape any new shocks; but only one or two came, and



those very light. Crowds of the population remained out of doors,



many dwellers in hotels taking refuge in carriages and cabs, and



staying in them through the night.







Next morning I walked forth to find what had happened,--first to



the cathedral, to see if anything was left of Giotto's tower and



Brunelleschi's dome, and, to my great joy, found them standing;



but, as I entered the vast building, I saw one of the enormous



iron bars which take the thrust of the wide arches of the nave



pulled apart and broken as if it had been pack-thread; there were



also a few cracks in one of the piers supporting the dome, but



all else was as before.







At the Palazzo Strozzi a crowd of people were examining sundry



crevices which had been made in its mighty walls: and at various



villas in the neighborhood, especially those on the road to San



Miniato, I found that the damage had been much worse. A part of



the tower of one villa, occupied by an English lady of literary



distinction, had been thrown down, crashing directly through one



of the upper rooms, but causing no loss of life; the villa of



Judge Stallo, at the Porta Romana, was so wrecked that he was



obliged to leave it; and in the house of another friend a heavy



German stove on the upper floor, having been thrown over, had



come down through the ceiling of the main parlor, crashing



through the grand piano, and thence into the cellar, without



injury to any person. One of the professors whom I afterward met



told me that he was giving a dinner-party when, suddenly, the



house was lifted and shaken to and fro, the chandeliers swinging,



broken glass crashing, and the ladies screaming, and, in a



moment, a portion of the outer wall gave way, but fortunately



fell outward, so that the guests scrambled forth over the ruins,



and passed the night in the garden. Perhaps the worst damage was



wrought at the Convent of the Certosa, where some of the



beautiful old work was irreparably injured.







It was very difficult next morning to get any real information



from the newspapers. They claimed that but three persons lost



their lives in the city: it was clearly thought best to minimize



the damage done, lest the stream of travel might be scared away.



I remarked at the time that we should never know fully what had



occurred until we received the American papers; and, curiously



enough, several weeks afterward a Californian showed me a very



full and minute account of the whole calamity, with careful



details, given in the telegraphic reports of a San Francisco



newspaper on the very morning after the earthquake.







On the way to America I passed a short time, during the month of



June, in London, meeting various interesting people, a most



pleasant occasion to me being a dinner given by Mr. Bayard, the



American minister, at which I met my classmate Wayne MacVeagh,



formerly attorney-general of the United States, minister to



Constantinople and ambassador to Rome, full, as usual, of



interesting reminiscence and witty suggestion. Very interesting



also to me was a talk with Mr. Holman Hunt, the eminent



pre-Raphaelite artist. He told me much of Tennyson dwelling upon



his morbid fear that people would stare at him. He also gave an



account of his meeting with Ruskin at Venice, when Ruskin took



Hunt to task for not having come to see him more frequently in



London; to which Hunt replied that, for one reason, he was very



busy, and that, for another, he did not wish to be classed with



the toadies who swarmed about Ruskin. Whereupon Ruskin said that



Hunt was right regarding the character of most of the people



about him. Hunt also spoke of the ill treatment of his beautiful



picture, "The Light of the World." From him, or from another



source about that time, I learned that formerly the Keble College



people had made much of it; but that, some one having interpreted



the rays passing through the different openings of the lantern in



Christ's hand as typifying truth shining through different



religious conceptions, the owners of the picture distrusted it,



and had recently refused to allow its exhibition in London.







It surprised me to find Holman Hunt so absorbed in his own art



that he apparently knew next to nothing about that of other



European masters,--nothing of Puvis de Chavannes at Paris;



nothing of Menzel, Knaus, and Werner at Berlin.







Having returned to America, I was soon settled in my old



homestead at Cornell,--as I supposed for the rest of my life.



Very delightful to me during this as well as other sojourns at



Cornell after my presidency were sundry visits to American



universities at which I was asked to read papers or make



addresses. Of these I may mention Harvard, Yale, and the State



universities of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota, at each of



which I addressed bodies of students on subjects which seemed to



me important, among these "The Diplomatic Service of the United



States," "Democracy and Education," "Evolution vs. Revolution in



Politics," and "The Problem of High Crime in the United States."



To me, as an American citizen earnestly desiring a noble future



for my country, it was one of the greatest of pleasures to look



into the faces of those large audiences of vigorous young men and



women, and, above all, at the State universities of the West,



which are to act so powerfully through so many channels of



influence in this new century. The last of the subjects



above-named interested me painfully, and I was asked to present



it to large general audiences, and not infrequently to the



congregations of churches. I had become convinced that looseness



in the administration of our criminal law is one of the more



serious dangers to American society, and my earlier studies in



this field were strengthened by my observations in the



communities I had visited during the long journey through our



Southern and Pacific States, to which I have just referred. Of



this I shall speak later.







Returning to Washington in February of 1897, I joined the



Venezuela Commission in presenting its report to the President



and Secretary of State, and so ended my duties under the



administration of Mr. Cleveland. Of my connection with the



political campaign of 1896 I have spoken elsewhere. In May of



1897, having been appointed by President McKinley ambassador to



Berlin, I sailed for Europe, and my journeys since that time have



consisted mainly of excursions to interesting historical



localities in Germany, with several short vacations in the



principal towns of northern Italy, upon the Riviera, and in



America.





















PART VII







MISCELLANEOUS RECOLLECTIONS







CHAPTER LVI







THE CARDIFF GIANT: A CHAPTER IN THE HISTORY OF HUMAN



FOLLY--1869-1870







The traveler from New York to Niagara by the northern route is



generally disappointed in the second half of his journey. During



the earlier hours of the day, moving rapidly up the valleys,



first of the Hudson and next of the Mohawk, he passes through a



succession of landscapes striking or pleasing, and of places



interesting from their relations to the French and Revolutionary



wars. But, arriving at the middle point of his journey,--the head



waters of the Mohawk,--a disenchantment begins. Thenceforward he



passes through a country tame, monotonous, and with cities and



villages as uninteresting in their appearance as in their names;



the latter being taken, apparently without rhyme or reason, from



the classical dictionary or the school geography.







And yet, during all that second half of his excursion, he is



passing almost within musket-shot of one of the most beautiful



regions of the Northern States,--the lake country of central and



western New York.







It is made up of a succession of valleys running from south to



north, and lying generally side by side, each with a beauty of



its own. Some, like the Oneida and the Genesee, are broad



expanses under thorough cultivation; others, like the Cayuga and



Seneca, show sheets of water long and wide, their shores



sometimes indented with glens and gorges, and sometimes rising



with pleasant slopes to the wooded hills; in others still, as the



Cazenovia, Skaneateles, Owasco, Keuka, and Canandaigua, smaller



lakes are set, like gems, among vineyards and groves; and in



others shimmering streams go winding through corn-fields and



orchards fringed by the forest.







Of this last sort is the Onondaga valley. It lies just at the



center of the State, and, although it has at its northern



entrance the most thriving city between New York and Buffalo, it



preserves a remarkable character of peaceful beauty.







It is also interesting historically. Here was the seat--the "long



house"--of the Onondagas, the central tribe of the Iroquois;



here, from time immemorial, were held the councils which decided



on a warlike or peaceful policy for their great confederation;



hither, in the seventeenth century, came the Jesuits, and among



them some who stand high on the roll of martyrs; hither, toward



the end of the eighteenth century, came Chateaubriand, who has



given in his memoirs his melancholy musings on the shores of



Onondaga Lake, and his conversation with the chief sachem of the



Onondaga tribe; hither, in the early years of this century, came



the companion of Alexis de Tocqueville, Gustave de Beaumont, who



has given in his letters the thoughts aroused within him in this



region, made sacred to him by the sorrows of refugees from the



French Revolution.







It is a land of peace. The remnant of the Indians live quietly



upon their reservation, Christians and pagans uniting



harmoniously, on broad-church principles, in the celebration of



Christmas and in the sacrifice of the white dog to the Great



Spirit.







The surrounding farmers devote themselves in peace to their



vocation. A noted academy, which has sent out many of their



children to take high places in their own and other States,



stands in the heart of the valley, and little red school-houses



are suitably scattered. Clinging to the hills on either side are



hamlets like Onondaga, Pompey, and Otisco, which in summer remind



one of the villages upon the lesser slopes of the Apennines. It



would be hard to find a more typical American population of the



best sort--the sort which made Thomas Jefferson believe in



democracy. It is largely of New England ancestry, with a free



admixture of the better sort of more recent immigrants. It was my



good fortune, during several years, to know many of these



dwellers in the valley, and perhaps I am prejudiced in their



favor by the fact that in my early days they listened very



leniently to my political and literary addresses, and twice sent



me to the Senate of the State with a large majority.







But truth, even more than friendship, compels this tribute to



their merits. Good influences have long been at work among them:



in the little cemetery near the valley church is the grave of one



of their early pastors,--a quiet scholar,--the Rev. Caleb



Alexander, who edited the first edition of the Greek Testament



ever published in the United States.







I have known one of these farmers, week after week during the



storms of a hard winter, drive four miles to borrow a volume of



Scott's novels, and, what is better, drive four miles each week



to return it. They are a people who read and think, and who can



be relied on, in the long run, to take the sensible view of any



question.







They have done more than read and think. They took a leading part



in raising regiments and batteries for the Civil War, and their



stalwart sons went valiantly forth as volunteers. The Onondaga



regiments distinguished themselves on many a hard-fought field;



they learned what war was like at Bull Run, and used their



knowledge to good purpose at Lookout Mountain, Five Forks, and



Gettysburg. Typical is the fact that one of these regiments was



led by a valley schoolmaster,--a man who, having been shot



through the body, reported dead, and honored with a public



commemoration at which eulogies were delivered by various



persons, including myself, lived to command a brigade, to take



part in the "Battle of the Clouds," where he received a second



wound, and to receive a third wound during the march with Sherman



to the sea.







Best of all, after the war the surviving soldiers returned, went



on with their accustomed vocations, and all was quiet as before.







But in the autumn[18] of 1869 this peaceful region was in



commotion from one end to the other. Strange reports echoed from



farm to farm. It was noised abroad that a great stone statue or



petrified giant had been dug up near the little hamlet of



Cardiff, almost at the southern extremity of the valley; and



soon, despite the fact that the crops were not yet gathered in,



and the elections not yet over, men and women and children were



hurrying from Syracuse and from the farm-houses along the valley



to the scene of the great discovery.











[18] October 16.











I had been absent in a distant State for some weeks, and, on my



return to Syracuse, meeting one of the most substantial citizens,



a highly respected deacon in the Presbyterian Church, formerly a



county judge, I asked him, in a jocose way, about the new object



of interest, fully expecting that he would join me in a laugh



over the whole matter; but, to my surprise, he became at once



very solemn. He said, "I assure you that this is no laughing



matter; it is a very serious thing, indeed; there is no question



that an amazing discovery has been made, and I advise you to go



down and see what you think of it."







Next morning, my brother and myself were speeding, after a fast



trotter in a light buggy, through the valley to the scene of the



discovery; and as we went we saw more and more, on every side,



evidences of enormous popular interest. The roads were crowded



with buggies, carriages, and even omnibuses from the city, and



with lumber-wagons from the farms--all laden with passengers. In



about two hours we arrived at the Newell farm, and found a



gathering which at first sight seemed like a county fair. In the



midst was a tent, and a crowd was pressing for admission.



Entering, we saw a large pit or grave, and, at the bottom of it,



perhaps five feet below the surface, an enormous figure,



apparently of Onondaga gray limestone. It was a stone giant, with



massive features, the whole body nude, the limbs contracted as if



in agony. It had a color as if it had lain long in the earth, and



over its surface were minute punctures, like pores. An especial



appearance of great age was given it by deep grooves and channels



in its under side, apparently worn by the water which flowed in



streams through the earth and along the rock on which the figure



rested. Lying in its grave, with the subdued light from the roof



of the tent falling upon it, and with the limbs contorted as if



in a death struggle, it produced a most weird effect. An air of



great solemnity pervaded the place. Visitors hardly spoke above a



whisper.







Coming out, I asked some questions, and was told that the farmer



who lived there had discovered the figure when digging a well.



Being asked my opinion, my answer was that the whole matter was



undoubtedly a hoax; that there was no reason why the farmer



should dig a well in the spot where the figure was found; that it



was convenient neither to the house nor to the barn; that there



was already a good spring and a stream of water running



conveniently to both; that, as to the figure itself, it certainly



could not have been carved by any prehistoric race, since no part



of it showed the characteristics of any such early work; that,



rude as it was, it betrayed the qualities of a modern performance



of a low order.







Nor could it be a fossilized human being; in this all scientific



observers of any note agreed. There was ample evidence, to one



who had seen much sculpture, that it was carved, and that the man



who carved it, though by no means possessed of genius or talent,



had seen casts, engravings, or photographs of noted sculptures.



The figure, in size, in massiveness, in the drawing up of the



limbs, and in its roughened surface, vaguely reminded one of



Michelangelo's "Night and Morning." Of course, the difference



between this crude figure and those great Medicean statues was



infinite; and yet it seemed to me that the man who had carved



this figure must have received a hint from those.







It was also clear that the figure was neither intended to be



considered as an idol nor as a monumental statue. There was no



pedestal of any sort on which it could stand, and the disposition



of the limbs and their contortions were not such as any sculptor



would dream of in a figure to be set up for adoration. That it



was intended to be taken as a fossilized giant was indicated by



the fact that it was made as nearly like a human being as the



limited powers of the stone-carver permitted, and that it was



covered with minute imitations of pores.







Therefore it was that, in spite of all scientific reasons to the



contrary, the work was very generally accepted as a petrified



human being of colossal size, and became known as "the Cardiff



Giant."







One thing seemed to argue strongly in favor of its antiquity, and



I felt bound to confess, to those who asked my opinion, that it



puzzled me. This was the fact that the surface water flowing



beneath it in its grave seemed to have deeply grooved and



channeled it on the under side. Now the Onondaga gray limestone



is hard and substantial, and on that very account used in the



locks upon the canals: for the running of surface water to wear



such channels in it would require centuries.







Against the opinion that the figure was a hoax various arguments



were used. It was insisted, first, that the farmer had not the



ability to devise such a fraud; secondly, that he had not the



means to execute it; third, that his family had lived there



steadily for many years, and were ready to declare under oath



that they had never seen it, and had known nothing of it until it



was accidentally discovered; fourth, that the neighbors had never



seen or heard of it; fifth, that it was preposterous to suppose



that such a mass of stone could have been brought and buried in



the place without some one finding it out; sixth, that the



grooves and channels worn in it by the surface water proved its



vast antiquity.







To these considerations others were soon added. Especially



interesting was it to observe the evolution of myth and legend.



Within a week after the discovery, full-blown statements appeared



to the effect that the neighboring Indians had abundant



traditions of giants who formerly roamed over the hills of



Onondaga; and, finally, the circumstantial story was evolved that



an Onondaga squaw had declared, "in an impressive manner," that



the statue "is undoubtedly the petrified body of a gigantic



Indian prophet who flourished many centuries ago and foretold the



coming of the palefaces, and who, just before his own death, said



to those about him that their descendants would see him



again."[19] To this were added the reflections of many good



people who found it an edifying confirmation of the biblical



text, "There were giants in those days." There was, indeed, an



undercurrent of skepticism among the harder heads in the valley,



but the prevailing opinion in the region at large was more and



more in favor of the idea that the object was a fossilized human



being--a giant of "those days." Such was the rush to see the



figure that the admission receipts were very large; it was even



stated that they amounted to five per cent. upon three millions



of dollars, and soon came active men from the neighboring region



who proposed to purchase the figure and exhibit it through the



country. A leading spirit in this "syndicate" deserves mention.



He was a horse-dealer in a large way and banker in a small way



from a village in the next county,--a man keen and shrewd, but



merciful and kindly, who had fought his way up from abject



poverty, and whose fundamental principle, as he asserted it, was



"Do unto others as they would like to do unto you, and--DO IT



FUST."[20] A joint-stock concern was formed with a considerable



capital, and an eminent show man, "Colonel" Wood, employed to



exploit the wonder.











[19] See "The Cardiff Giant Humbug," Fort Dodge, Iowa, 1870, p.



13.







[20] For a picture, both amusing and pathetic, of the doings of



this man, and also of life in the central New York villages, see



"David Harum," a novel by E. N. Westcott, New York, 1898.











A week after my first visit I again went to the place, by



invitation. In the crowd on that day were many men of light and



leading from neighboring towns,--among them some who made



pretensions to scientific knowledge. The figure, lying in its



grave, deeply impressed all; and as a party of us came away, a



very excellent doctor of divinity, pastor of one of the largest



churches in Syracuse, said very impressively, "Is it not strange



that any human being, after seeing this wonderfully preserved



figure, can deny the evidence of his senses, and refuse to



believe, what is so evidently the fact, that we have here a



fossilized human being, perhaps one of the giants mentioned in



Scripture?"







Another visitor, a bright-looking lady, was heard to declare,



"Nothing in the world can ever make me believe that he was not



once a living being. Why, you can see the veins in his legs."[21]











[21] See Letter of Hon. Galusha Parsons in the Fort Dodge



Pamphlet.











Another prominent clergyman declared with ex cathedra emphasis:



"This is not a thing contrived of man, but is the face of one who



lived on the earth, the very image and child of God."[22] And a



writer in one of the most important daily papers of the region



dwelt on the "majestic simplicity and grandeur of the figure,"



and added, "It is not unsafe to affirm that ninety-nine out of



every hundred persons who have seen this wonder have become



immediately and instantly impressed with the idea that they were



in the presence of an object not made by mortal hands.... No



piece of sculpture ever produced the awe inspired by this



blackened form.... I venture to affirm that no living sculptor



can be produced who will say that the figure was conceived and



executed by any human being."[23]











[22] See Mr. Stockbridge's article in the "Popular Science



Monthly," June, 1878.







[23] See "The American Goliath," Syracuse, 1869, p. 16.











The current of belief ran more and more strongly, and soon



embraced a large number of really thoughtful people. A week or



two after my first visit came a deputation of regents of the



State University from Albany, including especially Dr. Woolworth,



the secretary, a man of large educational experience, and no less



a personage in the scientific world than Dr. James Hall, the



State geologist, perhaps the most eminent American paleontologist



of that period.







On their arrival at Syracuse in the evening, I met them at their



hotel and discussed with them the subject which so interested us



all, urging them especially to be cautious, and stating that a



mistake might prove very injurious to the reputation of the



regents, and to the proper standing of scientific men and methods



in the State; that if the matter should turn out to be a fraud,



and such eminent authorities should be found to have committed



themselves to it, there would be a guffaw from one end of the



country to the other at the expense of the men intrusted by the



State with its scientific and educational interests. To this the



gentlemen assented, and next day they went to Cardiff. They came;



they saw; and they narrowly escaped being conquered. Luckily they



did not give their sanction to the idea that the statue was a



petrifaction, but Professor Hall was induced to say: "To all



appearance, the statue lay upon the gravel when the deposition of



the fine silt or soil began, upon the surface of which the



forests have grown for succeeding generations. Altogether it is



the most remarkable object brought to light in this country, and,



although not dating back to the stone age, is, nevertheless,



deserving of the attention of archaeologists."[24]











[24] See his letter of October 23, 1869, in the Syracuse papers.











At no period of my life have I ever been more discouraged as



regards the possibility of making right reason prevail among men.







As a refrain to every argument there seemed to go jeering and



sneering through my brain Schiller's famous line:







"Against stupidity the gods themselves fight in vain."[25]











[25] "Mit der Dummheit kampfen Gotter selbst vergebens." Jungfrau



von Orleans, Act III, scene 6.











There seemed no possibility even of SUSPENDING the judgment of



the great majority who saw the statue. As a rule, they insisted



on believing it a "petrified giant," and those who did not dwelt



on its perfections as an ancient statue. They saw in it a whole



catalogue of fine qualities; and one writer went into such



extreme ecstatics that he suddenly realized the fact, and ended



by saying, "but this is rather too high-flown, so I had better



conclude." As a matter of fact, the work was wretchedly defective



in proportion and features; in every characteristic of sculpture



it showed itself the work simply of an inferior stone-carver.







Dr. Boynton, a local lecturer on scientific subjects, gave it the



highest praise as a work of art, and attributed it to early



Jesuit missionaries who had come into that region about two



hundred years before. Another gentleman, who united the character



of a deservedly beloved pastor and an inspiring popular lecturer



on various scientific topics, developed this Boynton theory. He



attributed the statue to "a trained sculptor . . . who had noble



original powers; for none but such could have formed and wrought



out the conception of that stately head, with its calm smile so



full of mingled sweetness and strength." This writer then



ventured the query, "Was it not, as Dr. Boynton suggests, some



one from that French colony, . . . some one with a righteous soul



sighing over the lost civilization of Europe, weary of swamp and



forest and fort, who, finding this block by the side of the



stream, solaced the weary days of exile with pouring out his



thought upon the stone?"[26] Although the most eminent sculptor



in the State had utterly refused to pronounce the figure anything



beyond a poor piece of carving, these strains of admiration and



adoration continued.











[26] See the Syracuse daily papers as above.











There was evidently a "joy in believing" in the marvel, and this



was increased by the peculiarly American superstition that the



correctness of a belief is decided by the number of people who



can be induced to adopt it--that truth is a matter of majorities.



The current of credulity seemed irresistible.







Shortly afterward the statue was raised from its grave taken to



Syracuse and to various other cities, especially to the city of



New York, and in each place exhibited as a show.







As already stated, there was but one thing in the figure, as I



had seen it, which puzzled me, and that was the grooving of the



under side, apparently by currents of water, which, as the statue



appeared to be of our Onondaga gray limestone, would require very



many years. But one day one of the cool-headed skeptics of the



valley, an old schoolmate of mine, came to me, and with an air of



great solemnity took from his pocket an object which he carefully



unrolled from its wrappings, and said, "There is a piece of the



giant. Careful guard has been kept from the first in order to



prevent people touching it; but I have managed to get a piece of



it, and here it is." I took it in my hand, and the matter was



made clear in an instant. The stone was not our hard Onondaga



gray limestone, but soft, easily marked with the finger-nail,



and, on testing it with an acid, I found it, not hard carbonate



of lime, but a soft, friable sulphate of lime--a form of gypsum,



which must have been brought from some other part of the country.







A healthful skepticism now began to assert its rights. Professor



Marsh of Yale appeared upon the scene. Fortunately, he was not



only one of the most eminent of living paleontologists, but,



unlike most who had given an opinion, he really knew something of



sculpture, for he had been familiar with the best galleries of



the Old World. He examined the statue and said, "It is of very



recent origin, and a most decided humbug.... Very short exposure



of the statue would suffice to obliterate all trace of



tool-marks, and also to roughen the polished surfaces, but these



are still quite perfect, and hence the giant must have been very



recently buried.... I am surprised that any scientific observers



should not have at once detected the unmistakable evidence



against its antiquity."[27]











[27] See Professor Marsh's letter in the "Syracuse Daily



Journal," November 30, 1869.











Various suspicious circumstances presently became known. It was



found that Farmer Newell had just remitted to a man named Hull,



at some place in the West, several thousand dollars, the result



of admission fees to the booth containing the figure, and that



nothing had come in return. Thinking men in the neighborhood



reasoned that as Newell had never been in condition to owe any



human being such an amount of money, and had received nothing in



return for it, his correspondent had, not unlikely, something to



do with the statue.







These suspicions were soon confirmed. The neighboring farmers,



who, in their quiet way, kept their eyes open, noted a tall, lank



individual who frequently visited the place and seemed to



exercise complete control over Farmer Newell. Soon it was learned



that this stranger was the man Hull,--Newell's



brother-in-law,--the same to whom the latter had made the large



remittance of admission money. One day, two or three farmers from



a distance, visiting the place for the first time and seeing



Hull, said, "Why, that is the man who brought the big box down



the valley." On being asked what they meant, they said that,



being one evening in a tavern on the valley turnpike some miles



south of Cardiff, they had noticed under the tavern shed a wagon



bearing an enormous box; and when they met Hull in the bar-room



and asked about it, he said that it was some tobacco-cutting



machinery which he was bringing to Syracuse. Other farmers, who



had seen the box and talked with Hull at different places on the



road between Binghamton and Cardiff, made similar statements. It



was then ascertained that no such box had passed the toll-gates



between Cardiff and Syracuse, and proofs of the swindle began to



mature.







But skepticism was not well received. Vested interests had



accrued, a considerable number of people, most of them very good



people, had taken stock in the new enterprise, and anything which



discredited it was unwelcome to them.







It was not at all that these excellent people wished to



countenance an imposture, but it had become so entwined with



their beliefs and their interests that at last they came to abhor



any doubts regarding it. A pamphlet, "The American Goliath," was



now issued in behalf of the wonder. On its title-page it claimed



to give the "History of the Discovery, and the Opinions of



Scientific Men thereon." The tone of the book was moderate, but



its tendency was evident. Only letters and newspaper articles



exciting curiosity or favoring the genuineness of the statue were



admitted; adverse testimony, like that of Professor Marsh, was



carefully excluded.







Before long the matter entered into a comical phase. Barnum, King



of Showmen, attempted to purchase the "giant," but in vain. He



then had a copy made so nearly resembling the original that no



one, save, possibly, an expert, could distinguish between them.



This new statue was also exhibited as "the Cardiff Giant," and



thenceforward the credit of the discovery waned.







The catastrophe now approached rapidly, and soon affidavits from



men of high character in Iowa and Illinois established the fact



that the figure was made at Fort Dodge, in Iowa, of a great block



of gypsum there found; that this block was transported by land to



the nearest railway station, Boone, which was about forty-five



miles distant; that on the way the wagon conveying it broke down,



and that as no other could be found strong enough to bear the



whole weight, a portion of the block was cut off; that, thus



diminished, it was taken to Chicago, where a German stone-carver



gave it final shape; that, as it had been shortened, he was



obliged to draw up the lower limbs, thus giving it a strikingly



contracted and agonized appearance; that the under side of the



figure was grooved and channeled in order that it should appear



to be wasted by age; that it was then dotted or pitted over with



minute pores by means of a leaden mallet faced with steel



needles; that it was stained with some preparation which gave it



an appearance of great age; that it was then shipped to a place



near Binghamton, New York, and finally brought to Cardiff and



there buried. It was further stated that Hull, in order to secure



his brother-in-law, Farmer Newell, as his confederate in burying



the statue, had sworn him to secrecy; and, in order that the



family might testify that they had never heard or seen anything



of the statue until it had been unearthed, he had sent them away



on a little excursion covering the time when it was brought and



buried. All these facts were established by affidavits from men



of high character in Iowa and Illinois, by the sworn testimony of



various Onondaga farmers and men of business, and, finally, by



the admissions and even boasts of Hull himself.







Against this tide of truth the good people who had pinned their



faith to the statue--those who had vested interests in it, and



those who had rashly given solemn opinions in favor of



it--struggled for a time desperately. A writer in the "Syracuse



Journal" expressed a sort of regretful wonder and shame that "the



public are asked to overthrow the sworn testimony of sustained



witnesses corroborated by the highest scientific authority"--the



only sworn witness being Farmer Newell, whose testimony was not



at all conclusive, and the highest scientific authority being an



eminent local dentist who, early in his life, had given popular



chemical lectures, and who had now invested money in the



enterprise.







The same writer referred also with awe to "the men of sense,



property, and character who own the giant and receive whatever



revenue arises from its exhibition"; and the argument culminated



in the oracular declaration that "the operations of water as



testified and interpreted by science cannot create



falsehood."[28]











[28] See letter of "X" in the "Syracuse Journal," republished in



the Fort Dodge Pamphlet, pp. 15 and 16.











But all this pathetic eloquence was in vain. Hull, the inventor



of the statue, having realized more money from it than he



expected, and being sharp enough to see that its day was done,



was evidently bursting with the desire to avert scorn from



himself by bringing the laugh upon others, and especially upon



certain clergymen, whom, as we shall see hereafter, he greatly



disliked. He now acknowledged that the whole thing was a swindle,



and gave details of the way in which he came to embark in it. He



avowed that the idea was suggested to him by a discussion with a



Methodist revivalist in Iowa; that, being himself a skeptic in



religious matters, he had flung at his antagonist "those



remarkable stories in the Bible about giants"; that, observing



how readily the revivalist and those with him took up the cudgels



for the giants, it then and there occurred to him that, since so



many people found pleasure in believing such things, he would



have a statue carved out of stone which he had found in Iowa and



pass it off on them as a petrified giant. In a later conversation



he said that one thing which decided him was that the stone had



in it dark-colored bluish streaks which resembled in appearance



the veins of the human body. The evolution of the whole affair



thus became clear, simple, and natural.







Up to this time, Hull's remarkable cunning had never availed him



much. He had made various petty inventions, but had realized very



little from them; he had then made some combinations as regarded



the internal-revenue laws referring to the manufacture and sale



of tobacco, and these had only brought him into trouble with the



courts; but now, when the boundless resources of human credulity



were suddenly revealed to him by the revivalist, he determined to



exploit them. This evolution of his ideas strikingly resembles



that through which the mind of a worthless, shiftless, tricky



creature in western New York--Joseph Smith--must have passed



forty years before, when he dug up "the golden plates" of the



"Book of Mormon," and found plenty of excellent people who



rejoiced in believing that the Rev. Mr. Spalding's biblical novel



was a new revelation from the Almighty.







The whole matter was thus fully laid open, and it might have been



reasonably expected that thenceforward no human being would



insist that the stone figure was anything but a swindling hoax.







Not so. In the Divinity School of Yale College, about the middle



of the century, was a solemn, quiet, semi-jocose,



semi-melancholic resident graduate--Alexander McWhorter. I knew



him well. He had embarked in various matters which had not turned



out satisfactorily. Hot water, ecclesiastical and social, seemed



his favorite element.[29] He was generally believed to secure



most of his sleep during the day, and to do most of his work



during the night; a favorite object of his study being Hebrew.



Various strange things had appeared from his pen, and, most



curious of all, a little book entitled, "Yahveh Christ," in which



he had endeavored to demonstrate that the doctrine of the Trinity



was to be found entangled in the consonants out of which former



scholars made the word "Jehovah," and more recent scholars



"Yahveh"; that this word, in fact, proved the doctrine of the



Trinity.[30]











[29] The main evidence of this is to be found in "Truth Stranger



Than Fiction: A Narrative of Recent Transactions involving



Inquiries in Regard to the Principles of Honor, Truth, and



Justice, which Obtains in a Distinguished American University,"



by Catherine E. Beecher, New York, 1850.







[30] See "Yahveh Christ, or the Memorial Name," by A. McWhorter,



Boston, 1857.











He now brought his intellect to bear upon "the Cardiff Giant,"



and soon produced an amazing theory, developing it at length in a



careful article.[31]











[31] See McWhorter, "Tammuz and the Mound-builders," in the



"Galaxy," July, 1872.











This theory was simply that the figure discovered at Cardiff was



a Phenician idol; and Mr. McWhorter published, as the climax to



all his proofs, the facsimile and translation of an inscription



which he had discovered upon the figure--a "Phenician



inscription," which he thought could leave no doubt in the mind



of any person open to conviction.







That the whole thing had been confessed a swindle by all who took



part in it, with full details as to its origin and development,



seemed to him not worthy of the slightest mention. Regardless of



all the facts in the case, he showed a pathetic devotion to his



theory, and allowed his imagination the fullest play. He found,



first of all, an inscription of thirteen letters, "introduced by



a large cross or star-the Assyrian index of the Deity." Before



the last word of the inscription he found carved "a flower which



he regarded as consecrated to the particular deity Tammuz, and at



both ends of the inscription a serpent monogram and symbol of



Baal."







This inscription he assumed as an evident fact, though no other



human being had ever been able to see it. Even Professor White,



M.D., of the Yale Medical School, with the best intentions in the



world, was unable to find it. Dr. White was certainly not



inclined to superficiality or skepticism. With "achromatic



glasses which magnified forty-five diameters" he examined the



"pinholes" which covered the figure, and declared that "the



beautiful finish of every pore or pinhole appeared to me strongly



opposed to the idea that the statue was of modern workmanship."



He also thought he saw the markings which Mr. McWhorter



conjectured might be an inscription, and said in a letter,



"though I saw no recent tool-marks, I saw evidences of design in



the form and arrangement of the markings, which suggested the



idea of an inscription." And, finally, having made these



concessions, he ends his long letter with the very guarded



statement that, "though not fully DECIDED, I INCLINE TO THE



OPINION that the Onondaga statue is of ancient origin."[32]











[32] The italics are as in the original.











But this mild statement did not daunt Mr. McWhorter. Having



calmly pronounced Dr. White "in error," he proceeded with sublime



disregard of every other human being. He found that the statue



"belongs to the winged or 'cherubim' type"; that "down the left



side of the figure are seen the outlines of folded wings--even



the separate feathers being clearly distinguishable"; that "the



left side of the head is inexpressibly noble and majestic," and



"conforms remarkably to the type of the head of the



mound-builders"; that "the left arm terminates in what appears to



be a huge extended lion's paw"; that "the dual idea expressed in



the head is carried out in the figure"; that "in the wonderfully



artistic mouth of the divine side we find a suggestion of that of



the Greek Apollo." Mr. McWhorter also found other things that no



other human being was ever able to discern, and among them "a



crescent-shaped wound upon the left side," "traces of ancient



coloring" in all parts of the statue, and evidences that the



minute pores were made by "borers." He lays great stress on an



"ancient medal" found in Onondaga, which he thinks belongs "to



the era of the mound-builders," and on which he finds a "circle



inclosing an equilateral cross, both cross and circle, like the



wheel of Ezekiel, being full of small circles or eyes." As a



matter of fact, this "ancient medal" was an English penny, which



a street gamin of Syracuse said that he had found near the



statue, and the "equilateral cross" was simply the usual cross of



St. George. Mr. McWhorter thinks the circle inclosing the cross



denotes the "world soul," and in a dissertation of about twenty



pages he discourses upon "Baal," "Tammuz," "King Hiram of Tyre,"



the "ships of Tarshish," the "Eluli," and "Atlas," with plentiful



arguments drawn from a multitude of authorities, and among them



Sanchoniathon, Ezekiel, Plato, Dr. Dollinger, Isaiah,



Melanchthon, Lenormant, Humboldt, Sir John Lubbock, and Don



Domingo Juarros,--finally satisfying himself that the statue was



"brought over by a colony of Phenicians," possibly several



hundred years before Christ.[33]











[33] See the "Galaxy" article, as above, passim.











With the modesty of a true scholar he says, "Whether the final



battle at Onondaga . . . occurred before or after this event we



cannot tell"; but, resuming confidence, he says, "we only know



that at some distant period the great statue, brought in a 'ship



of Tarshish' across the sea of Atl, was lightly covered with



twigs and flowers and these with gravel." The deliberations of



the Pickwick Club over "Bill Stubbs, His Mark" pale before this;



and Dickens in his most expansive moods never conceived anything



more funny than the long, solemn discussion between the erratic



Hebrew scholar and the eminent medical professor at New Haven



over the "pores" of the statue, which one of them thought "the



work of minute animals," which the other thought "elaborate



Phenician workmanship," which both thought exquisite, and which



the maker of the statue had already confessed that he had made by



rudely striking the statue with a mallet faced with needles.







Mr. McWhorter's new theory made no great stir in the United



States, though some, doubtless, took comfort in it; but it found



one very eminent convert across the ocean, and in a place where



we might least have expected him. Some ten years after the events



above sketched while residing at Berlin as minister of the United



States, I one day received from an American student at the



University of Halle a letter stating that he had been requested



by no less a personage than the eminent Dr Schlottmann,



instructor in Hebrew in the theological school of that



university,--the successor of Gesenius in that branch of



instruction,--to write me for information regarding the Phenician



statue described by the Rev Alexander McWhorter.







In reply, I detailed to him the main points in the history of the



case, as it has been given in this chapter, adding, as against



the Phenician theory, that nothing in the nature of Phenician



remains had ever been found within the borders of the United



States, and that if they had been found, this remote valley,



three hundred miles from the sea, barred from the coast by



mountain-ranges, forests, and savage tribes, could never have



been the place chosen by Phenician navigators for such a deposit;



that the figure itself was clearly not a work of early art, but a



crude development by an uncultured stone-cutter out of his



remembrance of things in modern sculpture; and that the



inscription was purely the creation of Mr. McWhorter's



imagination.







In his acknowledgment, my correspondent said that I had left no



doubt in his mind as to the fact that the giant was a swindle;



but that he had communicated my letter to the eminent Dr.



Schlottmann, that the latter avowed that I had not convinced him,



and that he still believed the Cardiff figure to be a Phenician



statue bearing a most important inscription.







One man emerged from this chapter in the history of human folly



supremely happy: this was Hull, the inventor of the "giant." He



had at last made some money, had gained a reputation for



"smartness," and, what probably pleased him best of all, had



revenged himself upon the Rev. Mr. Turk of Ackley, Iowa, who by



lung-power had worsted him in the argument as to the giants



mentioned in Scripture.







So elate was he that he shortly set about devising another



"petrified man" which would defy the world. It was of clay baked



in a furnace, contained human bones, and was provided with "a



tail and legs of the ape type"; and this he caused to be buried



and discovered in Colorado. This time he claimed to have the aid



of one of his former foes--the great Barnum; and all went well



until his old enemy, Professor Marsh of Yale, appeared and



blasted the whole enterprise by a few minutes of scientific





observation and common-sense discourse.







Others tried to imitate Hull, and in 1876 one--William Buddock of



Thornton, St. Clair County, Michigan--manufactured a small effigy



in cement, and in due time brought about the discovery of it.



But, though several country clergymen used it to strengthen their



arguments as to the literal, prosaic correctness of Genesis, it



proved a failure. Finally, in 1889, twenty years after "the



Cardiff Giant" was devised, a "petrified man" was found near



Bathurst in Australia, brought to Sydney, and exhibited. The



result was, in some measure, the same as in the case of the



American fraud. Excellent people found comfort in believing, and



sundry pseudo-scientific men of a cheap sort thought it best to



pander to this sentiment; but a well-trained geologist pointed



out the absurdity of the popular theory, and finally the police



finished the matter by securing evidences of fraud.[34]











[34] For the Ruddock discovery see Dr. G.A. Stockwell in the



"Popular Science Monthly" for June, 1878. For the Australian



fraud see the London "Times" of August 2, 1889.











To close these annals, I may add that recently the inventor of



"the Cardiff Giant," Hull, being at the age of seventy-six years,



apparently in his last illness, and anxious for the glory in



history which comes from successful achievement, again gave to



the press a full account of his part in the affair, confirming



what he had previously stated, showing how he planned it,



executed it and realized a goodly sum for it; how Barnum wished



to purchase it from him; and how, above all, he had his joke at



the expense of those who, though they had managed to overcome him



in argument, had finally been rendered ridiculous in the sight of



the whole country.[35]

January 4, 1898.















CHAPTER LVII







PLANS AND PROJECTS, EXECUTED AND UNEXECUTED--1838-1905







Among those who especially attracted my youthful admiration were



authors, whether of books or of articles in the magazines. When



one of these personages was pointed out to me, he seemed of far



greater stature than the men about him. This feeling was



especially developed in the atmosphere of our household, where



scholars and writers were held in especial reverence, and was



afterward increased by my studies. This led me at Yale to take,



at first, much interest in general literature, and, as a result,



I had some youthful successes as a writer of essays and as one of



the editors of the "Yale Literary Magazine"; but although it was



an era of great writers, --the culmination of the Victorian



epoch,--my love for literature as literature gradually



diminished, and in place of it came in my young manhood a love of



historical and other studies to which literature was, to my mind,



merely subsidiary. With this, no doubt, the prevailing atmosphere



of Yale had much to do. There was between Yale and Harvard, at



that time, a great difference as regarded literary culture.



Living immediately about Harvard were most of the leading



American authors, and this fact greatly influenced that



university; at Yale less was made of literature as such, and more



was made of it as a means to an end--as ancillary in the



discussion of various militant political questions. Yale had



writers strong, vigorous, and acute: of such were Woolsey,



Porter, Bacon, and Bushnell, some of whom,--and, above all, the



last,--had they devoted themselves to pure literature, would have



gained lasting fame; but their interest in the questions of the



day was controlling, and literature, in its ordinary sense, was



secondary.







Harvard undoubtedly had the greater influence on leading American



thinkers throughout the nation, but much less direct influence on



the people at large outside of Massachusetts. The direct



influence of Yale on affairs throughout the United States was far



greater; it was felt in all parts of the country and in every



sort of enterprise. Many years after my graduation I attended a



meeting of the Yale alumni at Washington, where a Western



senator, on taking the chair, gave an offhand statement of the



difference between the two universities. "Gentlemen," said the



senator, "we all know what Harvard does. She fits men admirably



for life in Boston and its immediate neighborhood; they see



little outside of eastern Massachusetts and nothing outside of



New England; in Boston clubs they are delightful; elsewhere they



are intolerable. And we also know what Yale does: she sends her



graduates out into all parts of the land, for every sort of good



work, in town and country, even to the remotest borders of the



nation. Wherever you find a Yale man you find a man who is in



touch with his fellow-citizens; who appreciates them and is



appreciated by them; who is doing a man's work and is honored for



doing it."







This humorous overstatement indicates to some extent the real



difference between the spirit of the two universities: the



influence of Harvard being greater through the men it trained to



lead American thought from Boston as a center; the influence of



Yale being greater through its graduates who were joining in the



world's work in all its varied forms. Yet, curiously enough, it



was the utterance of a Harvard man which perhaps did most in my



young manhood to make me unduly depreciate literary work. I was



in deep sympathy with Theodore Parker, both in politics and



religion, and when he poured contempt over a certain class of



ineffective people as "weak and literary," something of his



feeling took possession of me. Then, too, I was much under the



influence of Thomas Carlyle: his preachments, hortatory and



objurgatory, witty and querulous, that men should defer work in



literature until they really have some worthy message to deliver,



had a strong effect upon me. While I greatly admired men like



Lowell and Whittier, who brought exquisite literary gifts to bear



powerfully on the struggle against slavery, persons devoted



wholly to literary work seemed to me akin to sugar-bakers and



confectionery-makers. I now know that this view was very



inadequate; but it was then in full force. It seemed to me more



and more absurd that a man with an alleged immortal soul, at such



a time as the middle of the nineteenth century, should devote



himself, as I then thought, to amusing weakish young men and



women by the balancing of phrases or the jingling of verses.







Therefore it was that, after leaving Yale, whatever I wrote had



some distinct purpose, with little, if any, care as to form. I



was greatly stirred against the encroachments of slavery in the



Territories, had also become deeply interested in university



education, and most of my thinking and writing was devoted to



these subjects; though, at times, I took up the cudgels in behalf



of various militant ideas that seemed to need support. The



lecture on "Cathedral Builders and Mediaeval Sculptors," given in



the Yale chapel after my return from Europe, often repeated



afterward in various parts of the country, and widely circulated



by extracts in newspapers, though apparently an exception to the



rule, was not really so. It aimed to show the educational value



of an ethical element in art. So, too, my article in the "New



Englander" on "Glimpses of Universal History" had as its object



the better development of historical studies in our universities.



My articles in the "Atlantic Monthly"--on "Jefferson and



Slavery," on "The Statesmanship of Richelieu," and on "The



Development and Overthrow of Serfdom in Russia"--all had a



bearing on the dominant question of slavery, and the same was



true of my Phi Beta Kappa address at Yale on "The Greatest Foe of



Modern States." Whatever I wrote during the Civil War, and



especially my pamphlet published in London as a reply to the



"American Diary" of the London "Times" correspondent, Dr.



Russell, had a similar character. The feeling grew upon me that



life in the United States during the middle of the nineteenth



century was altogether too earnest for devotion to pure



literature. The same feeling pervaded my lectures at the



University of Michigan, my effort being by means of the lessons



of history to set young men at thinking upon the great political



problems of our time. The first course of these lectures was upon



the French Revolution. Work with reference to it had been a labor



of love. During my student life in Paris, and at various other



times, I had devoted much time to the study of this subject, had



visited nearly all the places most closely connected with it not



only in Paris but throughout France, had meditated upon the noble



beginnings of the Revolution in the Palace and Tennis-court and



Church of St. Louis at Versailles; at Lyons, upon the fusillades;



at Nantes, upon the noyades; at the Abbaye, the Carmelite



monastery, the Barriere du Trone, and the cemetery of the Rue



Piepus in Paris, upon the Red Terror; at Nimes and Avignon and in



La Vendee, upon the White Terror; had collected, in all parts of



France, masses of books, manuscripts, public documents and



illustrated material on the whole struggle: full sets of the



leading newspapers of the Revolutionary period, more than seven



thousand pamphlets, reports, speeches, and other fugitive



publications, with masses of paper money, caricatures,



broadsides, and the like, thus forming my library on the



Revolution, which has since been added to that of Cornell



University. Based upon these documents and books were my lectures



on the general history of France and on the Revolution and



Empire. Out of this came finally a shorter series of lectures



upon which I took especial pains--namely, the "History of the



Causes of the French Revolution." This part of the whole course



interested me most as revealing the strength and weakness of



democracies and throwing light upon many problems which our own



republic must endeavor to solve; and I gave it not only at



Cornell, but at Johns Hopkins, the University of Pennsylvania,



Stanford, Tulane, and Washington. It still remains in manuscript:



whether it will ever be published is uncertain. Should my life be



somewhat extended, I hope to throw it into the form of a small



volume; but, at my present age and with the work now upon me, the



realization of this plan is doubtful. Still, in any case, there



is to me one great consolation: my collection of books aided the



former professor of modern history at Cornell, Mr. Morse Stevens,



in preparing what is unquestionably the best history of the



French Revolution in the English language. Nor has the collection



been without other uses. Upon it was based my pamphlet on "Paper



Money Inflation in France: How It Came, What It Brought, and How



It Ended," and this, being circulated widely as a campaign



document during two different periods of financial delusion, did,



I hope, something to set some controlling men into fruitful



trains of thought on one of the most important issues ever



presented to the American people.







Another course of lectures also paved the way possibly for a



book. I have already told how, during my college life and even



previously, I became fascinated with the history of the



Protestant Reformation. This led to further studies, and among



the first courses in history prepared during my professorship at



the University of Michigan was one upon the "Revival of Learning"



and the "Reformation in Germany." This course was developed later



until it was brought down to our own times; its continuance being



especially favored by my stay in Germany, first as a student and



later as minister of the United States. Most of my spare time at



these periods was given to this subject, and in the preparation



of these lectures I conceived the plan of a book bearing some



such name as "The Building of the German Empire," or "The



Evolution of Modern Germany." As to method, I proposed to make it



almost entirely biographical, and the reason for this is very



simple. Of all histories that I have known, those relating to



Germany have been the most difficult to read. Events in German



history are complicated and interwoven, to a greater degree than



those of any other nation, by struggles between races, between



three great branches of the Christian Church, between scores of



territorial divisions between greater and lesser monarchs,



between states and cities, between families, between individuals.



Then, to increase the complication, the center of interest is



constantly changing,--being during one period at Vienna, during



another at Frankfort-on-the-Main, during another at Berlin, and



during others at other places. Therefore it is that narrative



histories of Germany become to most foreign readers wretchedly



confusing: indeed, they might well be classed in Father



Bouhours's famous catalogue of "Books Impossible to be Read."



This obstacle to historical treatment, especially as regards the



needs of American readers, led me to group events about the lives



of various German leaders in thought and action-the real builders



of Germany; and this plan was perhaps confirmed by Carlyle's



famous dictum that the history of any nation is the history of



the great men who have made it. Impressed by such considerations,



I threw my lectures almost entirely into biographical form, with



here and there a few historical lectures to bind the whole



together. Beginning with Erasmus, Luther, Ulrich von Hutten, and



Charles V, I continued with Comenius, Canisius, Grotius,



Thomasius, and others who, whether born on German soil or not,



exercised their main influence in Germany. Then came the work of



the Great Elector, the administration of Frederick the Great, the



moral philosophy of Kant, the influence of the French Revolution



and Napoleon in Germany, the reforms of Stein, the hopeless



efforts of Joseph II and Metternich to win the hegemony for



Austria, and the successful efforts of Bismarck and the Emperor



William to give it to Prussia. My own direct knowledge of Germany



at different dates during more than forty-five years, and perhaps



also my official and personal relations to the two personages



last mentioned, enabled me to see some things which a man drawing



his material from books alone would not have seen. I have given



much of my spare time to this subject during several years, and



still hope, almost against hope, to bring it into book form.







Though thus interested in the work of a professor of modern



history, I could not refrain from taking part in the discussion



of practical questions pressing on thinking men from all sides



and earnestly demanding attention.







During my State senatorship I had been obliged more than once to



confess a lack, both in myself and in my colleagues, of much



fundamental knowledge especially important to men intrusted with



the legislation of a great commonwealth. Besides this, even as



far back as my Russian attacheship, I had observed a similar want



of proper equipment in our diplomatic and consular service. It



was clear to me that such subjects as international law,



political economy, modern history bearing on legislation, the



fundamental principles of law and administration, and especially



studies bearing on the prevention and cure of pauperism,



inebriety, and crime, and on the imposition of taxation, had been



always inadequately provided for by our universities, and in most



cases utterly neglected. In France and Germany I had observed a



better system, and, especially at the College de France, had been



interested in the courses of Laboulaye on "Comparative



Legislation." The latter subject, above all, seemed likely to



prove fruitful in the United States, where not only the national



Congress but over forty State legislatures are trying in various



ways, year after year, to solve the manifold problems presented



to them. Therefore it was that, while discharging my duties as a



commissioner at the Paris Exposition of 1878, I took pains to



secure information regarding instruction, in various European



countries, having as its object the preparation of young men for



the civil and diplomatic service. Especially was I struck by the



thorough equipment for the diplomatic and consular services given



at the newly established ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques at



Paris; consequently my report as commissioner was devoted to this



general subject. On my return this was published under the title



of "The Provision for Higher Instruction in Subjects bearing



directly on Public Affairs," and a portion of my material was



thrown, at a later day, into an appeal for the establishment of



proper courses in history and political science, which took the



final form of a commencement address at Johns Hopkins University.



It is a great satisfaction to me that this publication, acting



with other forces in the same direction, has been evidently



useful Nothing in the great development of our universities



during the last quarter of a century has been more gratifying and



full of promise for the country than the increased provision for



instruction bearing on public questions, and the increased



interest in such instruction shown by students, and, indeed, by



the community at large I may add that of all the kindnesses shown



me by the trustees of Cornell University at my resignation of its



presidency, there was none which pleased me more than the



attachment of my name to their newly established College of



History and Political Science.







During this same period another immediately practical subject



which interested me was the reform of the civil service; and,



having spoken upon this at various public meetings as well as



written private letters to various public men in order to keep



them thinking upon it, I published in 1882, in the "North



American Review," an article giving historical facts regarding



the origin, evolution, and results of the spoils system,



entitled, "Do the Spoils Belong to the Victor?" This brought upon



me a bitter personal attack from my old friend Mr. Thurlow Weed,



who, far-sighted and shrewd as he was, could never see how



republican institutions could be made to work without the



anticipation of spoils; but for this I was more than compensated



by the friendship of younger men who are likely to have far more



to do with our future political development than will the old



race of politicians, and, chief among these young men, Mr.



Theodore Roosevelt. I was also drawn off to other subjects,



making addresses at various universities on points which seemed



to me of importance, the most successful of all being one given



at Yale, upon the thirtieth anniversary of my class, entitled,



"The Message of the Nineteenth Century to the Twentieth." It was



an endeavor to strengthen the hands of those who were laboring to



maintain the proper balance between the humanities and technical



studies. To the latter I had indeed devoted many years of my



life, but the time had arrived when the other side seemed to



demand attention. This address, though the result of much



preliminary meditation, was dictated in all the hurry and worry



of a Cornell commencement week and given in the Yale chapel the



week following. Probably nothing which I have ever done, save



perhaps the tractate on "Paper Money Inflation in France,"



received such immediate and wide-spread recognition: it was



circulated very extensively in the New York "Independent," then



in the form of a pamphlet, for which there was large demand, and



finally, still more widely, in a cheap form.







Elsewhere in these reminiscences I have given an account of the



evolution of my "History of the Warfare of Science with



Theology." It was growing in my mind for about twenty years, and



my main reading, even for my different courses of lectures, had



more or less connection with it. First given as a lecture, it was



then extended into a little book which grew, in the shape of new



chapters, into much larger final form. It was written mainly at



Cornell University, but several of its chapters in other parts of



the world, one being almost wholly prepared on the Nile, at



Athens, and at Munich; another at St. Petersburg and during a



journey in the Scandinavian countries; and other chapters in



England and France. At last, in the spare hours of my official



life at St. Petersburg I made an end of the work; and in Italy,



during the winter and spring of 1894-1895, gave it final



revision.







For valuable aid in collecting materials and making notes in



public libraries, I was indebted to various friends whose names



are mentioned in its preface; and above all, to my dear friend



and former student, Professor George Lincoln Burr, who not only



aided me greatly during the latter part of my task by wise



suggestions and cautions, but who read the proofs and made the

Perhaps I may be allowed to repeat here that my purpose in



preparing this book was to strengthen not only science but



religion. I have never had any tendency to scoffing, nor have I



liked scoffers. Many of my closest associations and dearest



friendships have been, and still are, with clergymen. Clergymen



are generally, in our cities and villages, among the best and



most intelligent men that one finds, and, as a rule, with



thoughtful and tolerant old lawyers and doctors, the people best



worth knowing. My aim in writing was not only to aid in freeing



science from trammels which for centuries had been vexatious and



cruel, but also to strengthen religious teachers by enabling them



to see some of the evils in the past which, for the sake of



religion itself, they ought to guard against in the future.







During vacation journeys in Europe I was led, at various



historical centers, to take up special subjects akin to those



developed in my lectures. Thus, during my third visit to



Florence, having read Manzoni's "Promessi Sposi," which still



seems to me the most beautiful historical romance ever written, I



was greatly impressed by that part of it which depicts the



superstitions and legal cruelties engendered by the plague at



Milan. This story, with Manzoni's "Colonna Infame" and Cantu's



"Vita di Beccaria," led me to take up the history of criminal



law, and especially the development of torture in procedure and



punishment. Much time during two or three years was given to this



subject, and a winter at Stuttgart in 1877-1878 was entirely



devoted to it. In the course of these studies I realized as never



before how much dogmatic theology and ecclesiasticism have done



to develop and maintain the most frightful features in penal law.



I found that in Greece and Rome, before the coming in of



Christianity, torture had been reduced to a minimum and, indeed,



had been mainly abolished; but that the doctrine in the mediaeval



church as to "Excepted Cases"--namely, cases of heresy and



witchcraft, regarding which the theological dogma was developed



that Satan would exercise his powers to help his votaries--had



led to the reestablishment of a system of torture, in order to



baffle and overcome Satan, far more cruel than any which



prevailed under paganism.







I also found that, while under the later Roman emperors and, in



fact, down to the complete supremacy of Christianity, criminal



procedure grew steadily more and more merciful, as soon as the



church was established in full power yet another theological



doctrine came in with such force that it extended the use of



torture from the "Excepted Cases" named above to all criminal



procedure, and maintained it, in its most frightful form, for



more than a thousand years. This new doctrine was that since the



Almighty punishes his erring children by tortures infinite in



cruelty and eternal in duration, earthly authorities may justly



imitate this divine example so far as their finite powers enable



them to do so. I found this doctrine not only especially



effective in the mediaeval church, but taking on even more



hideous characteristics in the Protestant Church, especially in



Germany. On this subject I collected much material, some of it



very interesting and little known even to historical scholars. Of



this were original editions of the old criminal codes of Europe



and later criminal codes in France and Germany down to the French



Revolution, nearly all of which were enriched with engravings



illustrating instruments and processes of torture. So, too, a



ghastly light was thrown into the whole subject by the



executioners' tariffs in the various German states, especially



those under ecclesiastical rule. One of several in my possession,



which was published by the Elector Archbishop of Cologne in 1757



and stamped with the archbishop's seal, specifies and sanctions



every form of ingenious cruelty which one human being can



exercise upon another, and, opposite each of these cruelties, the



price which the executioner was authorized to receive for



administering it. Thus, for cutting off the right hand so much;



for tearing out the tongue, so much; for tearing the flesh with



hot pincers, so much; for burning a criminal alive, so much; and



so on through two folio pages. Moreover, I had collected details



of witchcraft condemnations, which, during more than a century,



went on at the rate of more than a thousand a year in Germany



alone, and not only printed books but the original manuscript



depositions taken from the victims in the torture-chamber. Of



these were the trial papers of Dietrich Flade, who had been,



toward the end of the sixteenth century, one of the most eminent



men in eastern Germany, chief justice of the province and rector



of the University of Treves. Having ventured to think witchcraft



a delusion, he was put on trial by the archbishop, tortured until



in his agony he acknowledged every impossible thing suggested to



him, and finally strangled and burned. In his case, as in various



others, I have the ipsissima verba of the accusers and accused:



the original report in the handwriting of the scribe who was



present at the torture and wrote down the questions of the judges



and the answers of the prisoner.







On this material I based a short course of lectures on "The



Evolution of Humanity in Criminal Law," and have often thought of



throwing these into the form of a small book to be called "The



Warfare of Humanity with Unreason"; but this will probably remain



a mere project. I mention it here, hoping that some other person,



with more leisure, will some day properly present these facts as



bearing on the claims of theologians and ecclesiastics to direct



education and control thought.







Of this period, too, were sundry projects for special monographs.



Thus, during various visits to Florence, I planned a history of



that city. It had interested me in my student days during my



reading of Sismondi's "History of the Italian Republics," and on



resuming my studies in that field it seemed to me that a history



of Florence might be made, most varied, interesting, and



instructive. It would embrace, of course, a most remarkable



period of political development--the growth of a mediaeval



republic out of early anarchy and tyranny; some of the most



curious experiments in government ever made; the most wonderful,



perhaps, of all growths in art, literature, and science; and the



final supremacy of a monarchy, bringing many interesting results,



yet giving some terrible warnings. But the more I read the more I



saw that to write such a history a man must relinquish everything



else, and so it was given up. So, too, during various sojourns at



Venice my old interest in Father Paul Sarpi, which had been



aroused during my early professorial life while reading his pithy



and brilliant history of the Council of Trent, was greatly



increased, and I collected a considerable library with the idea



of writing a short biography of him for American readers. This,



of all projects not executed, has been perhaps the most difficult



for me to relinquish. My last three visits to Venice have



especially revived my interest in him and increased my collection



of books regarding him. The desire to spread his fame has come



over me very strongly as I have stood in the council-rooms of the



Venetian Republic, which he served so long and so well; as I have



looked upon his statue on the spot where he was left for dead by



the emissaries of Pope Paul V; and as I have mused over his



grave, so long desecrated and hidden by monks, but in these



latter days honored with an inscription. But other work has



claimed me, and others must write upon this subject. It is well



worthy of attention, not only for the interest of its details,



but for the light it throws upon great forces still at work in



the world. Strong men have discussed it for European readers, but



it deserves to be especially presented to Americans.







I think an eminent European publicist entirely right in saying



that Father Paul is one of the three men, since the middle ages,



who have exercised the most profound influence on Italy; the



other two being Galileo and Machiavelli. The reason assigned by



this historian for this judgment is not merely the fact that



Father Paul was one of the most eminent men in science whom Italy



has produced, nor the equally incontestable fact that he taught



the Venetian Republic--and finally the world--how to withstand



papal usurpation of civil power, but that by his history of the



Council of Trent he showed "how the Holy Spirit conducts the



councils of the church" ("comme quoi le Saint Esprit dirige les



conciles").[36]











[36] Since writing the above, I have published in the "Atlantic



Monthly" two historical essays upon Sarpi.











Yet another subject which I would have been glad to present was



the life of St. Francis Xavier--partly on account of my



veneration for the great Apostle to the Indies, and partly



because a collation of his successive biographies so strikingly



reveals the origin and growth of myth and legend in the warm



atmosphere of devotion. The project of writing such a book was



formed in my Cornell lecture-room at the close of a short course



of lectures on the "Jesuit Reaction which followed the



Reformation." In the last of these I had pointed out the beauty



of Xavier's work, and had shown how natural had been the immense



growth of myth and legend in connection with it. Among my hearers



was Goldwin Smith, and as we came out he said: "I have often



thought that if any one were to take a series of the published



lives of one of the great Jesuit saints, beginning at the



beginning and comparing the successive biographies as they have



appeared, century after century, down to our own time much light



would be thrown upon the evolution of the miraculous in



religion." I was struck by this idea, and it occurred to me that,



of all such examples, that of Francis Xavier would be the most



fruitful and interesting. For we have, to begin with, his own



letters written from the scene of his great missionary labors in



the East, in which no miracles appear. We have the letters of his



associates at that period, in which there is also no knowledge



shown of any miracles performed by him. We also have the great



speeches of Laynez, one of Xavier's associates, who, at the



Council of Trent, did his best to promote Jesuit interests, and



who yet showed no knowledge of any miracles performed by Xavier.



We have the very important work by Joseph Acosta, the eminent



provincial of the Jesuits, written at a later period, largely on



the conversion of the Indies, and especially on Xavier's part in



it, which, while accepting, in a perfunctory way, the attribution



of miracles to Xavier, gives us reasoning which seems entirely to



discredit them. Then we have biographies of Xavier, published



soon after his death, in which very slight traces of miracles



begin to be found; then other biographies later and later,



century after century, in which more and more miracles appear,



and earlier miracles of very simple character grow more and more



complex and astounding, until finally we see him credited with a



vast number of the most striking miracles ever conceived of. In



order to develop the subject I have collected books and documents



of every sort bearing upon it from his time to ours, and have



given a brief summary of the results in my "History of the



Warfare of Science." But the full development of this subject,



which throws intense light upon the growth of miracles in the



biographies of so many benefactors of our race, must probably be



left to others.







It should be treated with judicial fairness. There should not be



a trace of prejudice against the church Xavier served. The



infallibility of the Pope who canonized him was indeed committed



to the reality of miracles which Xavier certainly never



performed; but the church at large cannot justly be blamed for



this: it was indeed made the more illustrious by Xavier's great



example. The evil, if evil there was, lay in human nature, and a



proper history of this evolution of myth and legend, by throwing



light into one of the strongest propensities of devout minds,



would give a most valuable warning against basing religious



systems on miraculous claims which are constantly becoming more



and more discredited and therefore more and more dangerous to any



system which persists in using them.







Still another project interested me; effort connected with it was



a kind of recreation; this project was formed during my attache



days at St. Petersburg with Governor Seymour. It was a brief



biography of Thomas Jefferson. I made some headway in it, but was



at last painfully convinced that I should never have time to



finish it worthily. Besides this, after the Civil War, Jefferson,



though still interesting to me, was by no means so great a man in



my eyes as he had been. Perhaps no doctrine ever cost any other



country so dear as Jefferson's pet theory of State rights cost



the United States: nearly a million of lives lost on



battle-fields, in prisons, and in hospitals; nearly ten thousand



millions of dollars poured into gulfs of hatred.







With another project I was more fortunate. In 1875 I was asked to



prepare a bibliographical introduction to Mr. O'Connor Morris's



short history of the French Revolution. This I did with much



care, for it seemed to me that this period in history, giving



most interesting material for study and thought, had been much



obscured by ideas drawn from trashy books instead of from the



really good authorities.







Having finished this short bibliography, it occurred to me that a



much more extensive work, giving a selection of the best



authorities on all the main periods of modern history, might be



useful. This I began, and was deeply interested in it; but here,



as in various other projects, the fates were against me. Being



appointed a commissioner to the French Exposition, and seeing in



this an opportunity to do other work which I had at heart, I



asked my successor in the professorship of history at the



University of Michigan, who at a later period became my successor



as president of Cornell, Dr. Charles Kendall Adams, to take the



work off my hands. This he did, and produced a book far better



than any which I could have written. The kind remarks in his



preface regarding my suggestions I greatly prize, and feel that



this project, at least, though I could not accomplish it, had a



most happy issue.







Another project which I have long cherished is of a very



different sort; and though it may not be possible for me to carry



it out, my hope is that some other person will do so. For many



years I have noted with pride the munificent gifts made for



educational and charitable purposes in the United States. It is a



noble history,--one which does honor not only to our own country,



but to human nature. No other country has seen any munificence



which approaches that so familiar to Americans. The records show



that during the year 1903 nearly, if not quite, eighty millions



of dollars were given by private parties for these public



purposes. It has long seemed to me that a little book based on



the history of such gifts, pointing out the lines in which they



have been most successful, might be of much use, and more than



once I have talked over with my dear friend Gilman, at present



president of the Carnegie Institution at Washington, the idea of



our working together in the production of a pamphlet or volume



with some such title as, "What Rich Americans have Done and can



Do with their Money." But my friend has been busy in his great



work of founding and developing the university at Baltimore, I



have been of late years occupied in other parts of the world, and



so this project remains unfulfilled. There are many reasons for



the publication of such a book. Most of the gifts above referred



to have been wisely made; but some have not, and a considerable



number have caused confusion in American education rather than



aided its healthful development. Many good things have resulted



from these gifts, but some vastly important matters have been



utterly neglected. We have seen excellent small colleges



transformed by gifts into pretentious and inadequate shams called



"universities"; we have seen great telescopes given without any



accompanying instruments, and with no provision for an



observatory; magnificent collections in geology given to



institutions which had no professor in that science; beautiful



herbariums added to institutions where there is no instruction in



botany; professorships of no use established where others of the



utmost importance should have been founded; institutions founded



where they were not needed, and nothing done where they were



needed. He who will write a thoughtful book on this subject,



based upon a careful study of late educational history, may



render a great service. As I revise this chapter I may say that



in an address at Yale in 1903, entitled, "A Patriotic



Investment," I sought to point out one of the many ways in which



rich men may meet a pressing need of our universities with great



good to the country at large.[37]











[37] See "A Patriotic Investment," New Haven, 1903.











Yet another project has occupied much time and thought, and may,



I hope, be yet fully carried out. For many years I have thought



much on our wretched legislation against crime and on the



imperfect administration of such criminal law as we have. Years



ago, after comparing the criminal statistics of our own country



with those of other nations, I came to the conclusion that, with



the possible exception of the lower parts of the Italian kingdom,



there is more unpunished murder in our own country than in any



other in the civilized world. This condition of things I found to



be not unknown to others; but there seemed to prevail a sort of



listless hopelessness regarding any remedy for it. Dining in



Philadelphia with my classmate and dear friend Wayne MacVeagh, I



found beside me one of the most eminent judges in Pennsylvania,



and this question of high crime having been broached and the



causes of it discussed, the judge quietly remarked, "The taking



of life, after a full and fair trial, as a penalty for murder,



seems to be the only form of taking life to which the average



American has any objection." Many of our dealings with murder and



other high crimes would seem to show that the judge was, on the



whole, right. My main study on the subject was made in 1892,



during a journey of more than twelve thousand miles with Mr.



Andrew Carnegie and his party through the Middle, Southern,



Southwestern, Pacific, and Northwestern States. We stopped at all



the important places on our route, and at vast numbers of



unimportant places; at every one of these I bought all the



newspapers obtainable, examined them with reference to this



subject, and found that the long daily record of murders in our



metropolitan journals is far from giving us the full reality. I



constantly found in the local papers, at these out-of-the-way



places, numerous accounts of murders which never reached the



metropolitan journals. Most striking testimony was also given me



by individuals,--in one case by a United States senator, who gave



me the history of a country merchant, in one of the Southwestern



States, who had at different times killed eight persons, and who



at his last venture, endeavoring to kill a man who had vexed him



in a mere verbal quarrel, had fired into a lumber-wagon



containing a party coming from church, and killed three persons,



one of them a little girl. And my informant added that this



murderer had never been punished. In California I saw walking



jauntily along the streets, and afterward discoursing in a



drawing-room, a man who, on being cautioned by a policeman while



disturbing the public peace a year or two before, had simply shot



the policeman dead, and had been tried twice, but each time with



a disagreement of the jury. Multitudes of other cases I found



equally bad. I collected a mass of material illustrating the



subject, and on this based an address given for the first time in



San Francisco, and afterward at Boston, New York, New Haven,



Cornell University, and the State universities of Wisconsin and



Minnesota. My aim was to arouse thinking men to the importance of



the subject, and I now hope to prepare a discussion of "The



Problem of High Crime," to be divided into three parts, the first



on the present condition of the problem, the second on its



origin, and the third on possible and probable remedies.







Of all my projects for historical treatises, there are two which



I have dreamed of for many years, hoping against hope for their



realization. I have tried to induce some of our younger



historical professors to undertake them or to train up students



to undertake them; and, as the time has gone by when I can devote



myself to them, I now mention them in the hope that some one will



arise to do honor to himself and to our country by developing



them.







The first of these is a history of the middle ages in the general



style of Robertson's "Introduction to the Life of Charles V."



Years ago, when beginning my work as a professor of modern



history at the University of Michigan, I felt greatly the need



for my students of some work which should show briefly but



clearly the transition from ancient history to modern. Life is



not long enough for the study of the minute details of the



mediaeval period in addition to ancient and modern history. What



is needed for the mass of thinking young men is something which



shall show what the work was which was accomplished between the



fall of Rome and the new beginnings of civilization at the



Renascence and the Reformation. For this purpose Robertson's work



was once a masterpiece. It has rendered great services not only



in English-speaking lands, but in others, by enabling thinking



men to see how this modern world has been developed out of the



past and to gain some ideas as to the way in which a yet nobler



civilization may be developed out of the present Robertson's work



still remains a classic, but modern historical research has



superseded large parts of it, and what is now needed is a short



history--of, say, three hundred pages--carried out on the main



lines of Robertson, taking in succession the most important



subjects in the evolution of mediaeval history, discarding all



excepting the leading points in chronology, and bringing out



clearly the sequence of great historical causes and results from



the downfall of Rome to the formation of the great modern states.



And there might well be brought into connection with this what



Robertson did not give--namely, sketches showing the character



and work of some of the men who wrought most powerfully in this



transition.







During my stay at the University of Michigan, I made a beginning



of such a history by giving a course of lectures on the growth of



civilization in the middle ages, taking up such subjects as the



downfall of Rome, the barbarian invasion, the rise of the papacy,



feudalism, Mohammedanism, the anti-feudal effects of the



crusades, the rise of free cities, the growth of law, the growth



of literature, and ending with the centralization of monarchical



power in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. But the lectures



then prepared were based merely upon copious notes and given, as



regarded phrasing, extemporaneously. It is too late for me now to



write them out or to present the subject in the light of modern



historical research; but I know of no subject which is better



calculated to broaden the mind and extend the horizon of



historical studies in our universities. Provost Stille of the



University of Pennsylvania did indeed carry out, in part,



something of this kind, but time failed him for making more than



a beginning. The man who, of all in our time, seems to me best



fitted to undertake this much needed work is Frederic Harrison.



If the general method of Robertson were combined with the spirit



shown in the early chapters of Harrison's book on "The Meaning of



History," the resultant work would be not only of great service,



but attractive to all thinking men.







And, last of all, a project which has long been one of my



dreams--a "History of Civilization in Spain." Were I twenty years



younger, I would gladly cut myself loose from all entanglements



and throw myself into this wholly. It seems to me the most



suggestive history now to be written. The material at hand is



ample and easily accessible. A multitude of historians have made



remarkable contributions to it, and among these, in our own



country, Irving, Prescott, Motley, Ticknor, and Lea; in England,



Froude, Ford, Buckle, and others have given many pregnant



suggestions and some increase of knowledge; Germany and France



have contributed much in the form of printed books; Spain, much



in the publication of archives and sundry interesting histories



apologizing for the worst things in Spanish history; the



Netherlands have also contributed documents of great value. There



is little need of delving among manuscripts; that has already



been done, and the results are easily within reach of any



scholar. The "History of Civilization in Spain" is a history of



perhaps the finest amalgamation of races which was made at the



downfall of the Roman Empire; of splendid beginnings of liberty



and its noble exercise in the middle ages; of high endeavor; of a



wonderful growth in art and literature. But it is also a history



of the undermining and destruction of all this great growth, so



noble, so beautiful, by tyranny in church and state--tyranny over



body and mind, heart and soul. A simple, thoughtful account of



this evolution of the former glory of Spain, and then of the



causes of her decline to her present condition, would be full of



suggestions for fruitful thought regarding politics, religion,



science, literature, and art. To write such a history was the



best of my dreams. Perhaps, had I been sent in 1879 as minister



to Madrid instead of to Berlin, I might at least have made an



effort to begin it, and, whether successful or not, might have



led other men to continue it. It is now too late for me, but I



still hope that our country will supply some man to undertake it.



Whoever shall write such a book in an honest, broad, and



impartial spirit will gain not only honor for his country and



himself, but will render a great service to mankind.







In closing this chapter on "Plans and Projects, Executed and



Unexecuted," I know well that my confessions will do me no good



in the eyes of many who shall read them. It will be said that I



attempted too many things. In mitigation of such a judgment I may



say that the conditions of American life in the second half of



the century just closed have been very different from those in



most other countries. It has been a building period, a period of



reforms necessitated by the rapid growth of our nation out of



earlier conditions and limitations. Every thinking man who has



felt any responsibility has necessarily been obliged to take part



in many enterprises of various sorts: necessary work has abounded



and has been absolutely forced upon him. It has been a period in



which a man could not well devote himself entirely to the dative



case. Besides this, so far as concerns myself, I had much



practical administrative work to do, was plunged into the midst



of it at two universities and at various posts in the diplomatic



service, to say nothing of many other duties, so that my plans



were constantly interfered with. Like many others during the



latter half of the nineteenth century, I have been obliged to



obey the injunction, "Do the work which lieth nearest thee." It



has happened more than once that when all has been ready for some



work which I greatly desired to do, and which I hoped might be of



use, I have been suddenly drawn off to official duties by



virtually an absolute command. Take two examples out of many: I



had brought my lectures on German history together, had collected



a mass of material for putting them into final shape as a



"History of the Building of the New Germany," and had written two



chapters, when suddenly came the summons from President Cleveland



to take part in the Venezuela Commission,--a summons which it was



impossible to decline. For a year this new work forbade a



continuance of the old; and just as I was again free came the



Bryan effort to capture the Presidency, which, in my opinion,



would have resulted in wide-spread misery at home and in dishonor



to the American name through out the world. Most reluctantly then



I threw down my chosen work and devoted my time to what seemed to



me to be a political duty. Then followed my appointment to the



Berlin Embassy, which could not be declined; and just at the



period when I hoped to secure leisure at Berlin for continuing



the preparation of my book on Germany, there came duties at The



Hague Conference which took my time for nearly a year. It is,



perhaps, unwise for me thus to make a clean breast of it,--"qui



s'excuse, s'accuse"; but I have something other than excuses to



make: I may honestly plead before my old friends and students who



shall read this book that my life has been mainly devoted to



worthy work; that I can look back upon the leading things in it



with satisfaction; that, whether as regards religion, politics,



education, or the public service in general, it will be found not



a matter of unrelated shreds and patches, but to have been



developed in obedience to a well-defined line of purpose. I



review the main things along this line with thankfulness: First,



my work at the University of Michigan, which enabled me to do



something toward preparing the way for a better system of higher



education in the United States; next, my work in the New York



State Senate, which enabled me to aid effectively in developing



the school system in the State, in establishing a health



department in its metropolis, in promoting good legislation in



various fields; and in securing the charter of Cornell



University; next, my part in founding Cornell University and in



maintaining it for more than twenty years; next, the preparation



of a book which, whatever its shortcomings and however deprecated



by many good men, has, as I believe, done service to science, to



education, and to religion; next, many speeches, articles,



pamphlets, which have aided in the development of right reason on



political, financial, and social questions; and, finally, the



opportunity given me at a critical period to aid in restoring and



maintaining good relations between the United States and Germany,



and in establishing the international arbitration tribunal of The



Hague. I say these things not boastingly, but reverently. I have



sought to fight the good fight; I have sought to keep the



faith,--faith in a Power in the universe good enough to make



truth-seeking wise, and strong enough to make truth-telling



effective,--faith in the rise of man rather than in the fall of



man,--faith in the gradual evolution and ultimate prevalence of



right reason among men. So much I hope to be pardoned for giving



as an apologia pro vita mea.

AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF



ANDREW DICKSON WHITE











CHAPTER I







BOYHOOD IN CENTRAL NEW YORK--1832-1850











At the close of the Revolution which separated the



colonies from the mother country, the legislature of



New York set apart nearly two million acres of land, in the



heart of the State, as bounty to be divided among her soldiers



who had taken part in the war; and this ``Military



Tract,'' having been duly divided into townships, an ill-



inspired official, in lack of names for so many divisions,



sprinkled over the whole region the contents of his classical



dictionary.  Thus it was that there fell to a beautiful



valley upon the headwaters of the Susquehanna the



name of ``Homer.''  Fortunately the surveyor-general



left to the mountains, lakes, and rivers the names the



Indians had given them, and so there was still some poetical



element remaining in the midst of that unfortunate



nomenclature.  The counties, too, as a rule, took Indian



names, so that the town of Homer, with its neighbors,



Tully, Pompey, Fabius, Lysander, and the rest, were embedded



in the county of Onondaga, in the neighborhood



of lakes Otisco and Skaneateles, and of the rivers Tioughnioga



and Susquehanna.







Hither came, toward the close of the eighteenth century,



a body of sturdy New Englanders, and, among them, my



grandfathers and grandmothers.  Those on my father's



side: Asa White and Clara Keep, from Munson, Massa-



chusetts; those on my mother's side, Andrew Dickson,



from Middlefield, Massachusetts, and Ruth Hall from



Guilford, Connecticut.  They were all of ``good stock.'' 



When I was ten years old I saw my great-grandfather at



Middlefield, eighty-two years of age, sturdy and vigorous;



he had mowed a broad field the day before, and he walked



four miles to church the day after.  He had done his duty



manfully during the war, had been a member of the



``Great and General Court'' of Massachusetts, and had



held various other offices, which showed that he enjoyed



the confidence of his fellow-citizens.  As to the other side



of the house, there was a tradition that we came from



Peregrine White of the Mayflower; but I have never had



time to find whether my doubts on the subject were well



founded or not.  Enough for me to know that my yeomen



ancestors did their duty in war and peace, were honest,



straightforward, God-fearing men and women, who



owned their own lands, and never knew what it was to



cringe before any human being.







These New Englanders literally made the New York



wilderness to blossom as the rose; and Homer, at my



birth in 1832, about forty years after the first settlers



came, was, in its way, one of the prettiest villages



imaginable.  In the heart of it was the ``Green,'' and along



the middle of this a line of church edifices, and the academy. 



In front of the green, parallel to the river, ran,



north and south, the broad main street, beautifully shaded



with maples, and on either side of this, in the middle of



the village, were stores, shops, and the main taverns; while



north and south of these were large and pleasant dwellings,



each in its own garden or grove or orchard, and



separated from the street by light palings,--all, without



exception, neat, trim, and tidy.







My first recollections are of a big, comfortable house



of brick, in what is now called ``colonial style,'' with a



``stoop,'' long and broad, on its southern side, which in



summer was shaded with honeysuckles.  Spreading out



southward from this was a spacious garden filled with



old-fashioned flowers, and in this I learned to walk.  To



this hour the perfume of a pink brings the whole scene



before me, and proves the justice of Oliver Wendell



Holmes's saying that we remember past scenes more vividly



by the sense of smell than by the sense of sight.







I can claim no merit for clambering out of poverty. 



My childhood was happy; my surroundings wholesome;



I was brought up neither in poverty nor riches; my parents



were what were called ``well-to-do-people''; everything



about me was good and substantial; but our mode



of life was frugal; waste or extravagance or pretense was



not permitted for a moment.  My paternal grandfather



had been, in the early years of the century, the richest



man in the township; but some time before my birth he



had become one of the poorest; for a fire had consumed



his mills, there was no insurance, and his health gave way. 



On my father, Horace White, had fallen, therefore, the



main care of his father's family.  It was to the young



man, apparently, a great calamity:--that which grieved



him most being that it took him--a boy not far in his



teens--out of school.  But he met the emergency



manfully, was soon known far and wide for his energy,



ability, and integrity, and long before he had reached



middle age was considered one of the leading men of business



in the county.







My mother had a more serene career.  In another part



of these Reminiscences, saying something of my religious



and political development, I shall speak again of her and



of her parents.  Suffice it here that her father prospered



as a man of business, was known as ``Colonel,'' and also



as ``Squire'' Dickson, and represented his county in the



State legislature.  He died when I was about three years



old, and I vaguely remember being brought to him as he



lay upon his death-bed.  On one account, above all others,



I have long looked back to him with pride.  For the first



public care of the early settlers had been a church, and



the second a school.  This school had been speedily



developed into Cortland Academy, which soon became fa-



mous throughout all that region, and, as a boy of five or



six years of age, I was very proud to read on the corner-



stone of the Academy building my grandfather's name



among those of the original founders.







Not unlikely there thus came into my blood the strain



which has led me ever since to feel that the building up of



goodly institutions is more honorable than any other



work,--an idea which was at the bottom of my efforts in



developing the University of Michigan, and in founding



Cornell University.







To Cortland Academy students came from far and



near; and it soon began sending young men into the foremost



places of State and Church.  At an early day, too,



it began receiving young women and sending them forth



to become the best of matrons.  As my family left the



place when I was seven years old I was never within



its walls as a student, but it acted powerfully on my



education in two ways,--it gave my mother the best of



her education, and it gave to me a respect for scholarship. 



The library and collections, though small, suggested



pursuits better than the scramble for place or pelf; the



public exercises, two or three times a year, led my



thoughts, no matter how vaguely, into higher regions, and



I shall never forget the awe which came over me when



as a child, I saw Principal Woolworth, with his best



students around him on the green, making astronomical



observations through a small telescope.







Thus began my education into that great truth, so



imperfectly understood, as yet, in our country, that stores,



shops, hotels, facilities for travel and traffic are not the



highest things in civilization.







This idea was strengthened in the family.  Devoted as



my father was to business, he always showed the greatest



respect for men of thought.  I have known him, even



when most absorbed in his pursuits, to watch occasions



for walking homeward with a clergyman or teacher,



whose conversation he especially prized.  There was scant



respect in the family for the petty politicians of the



region; but there was great respect for the instructors



of the academy, and for any college professor who happened



to be traveling through the town.  I am now in my



sixty-eighth year, and I write these lines from the American



Embassy in Berlin.  It is my duty here, as it has



been at other European capitals, to meet various high



officials; but that old feeling, engendered in my childhood,



continues, and I bow to the representatives of



the universities,--to the leaders in science, literature, and



art, with a feeling of awe and respect far greater than



to their so-called superiors,--princelings and high military



or civil officials.







Influences of a more direct sort came from a primary



school.  To this I was taken, when about three years old,



for a reason which may strike the present generation



as curious.  The colored servant who had charge of me



wished to learn to read--so she slipped into the school and



took me with her.  As a result, though my memory runs



back distinctly to events near the beginning of my fourth



year, it holds not the faintest recollection of a time when



I could not read easily.  The only studies which I recall



with distinctness, as carried on before my seventh year,



are arithmetic and geography.  As to the former, the



multiplication-table was chanted in chorus by the whole



body of children, a rhythmical and varied movement of



the arms being carried on at the same time.  These exercises



gave us pleasure and fastened the tables in our



minds.  As to geography, that gave pleasure in another



way.  The books contained pictures which stimulated my



imagination and prompted me to read the adjacent text.



There was no over-pressure.  Mental recreation and



information were obtained in a loose way from ``Rollo



Books,'' ``Peter Parley Books,'' ``Sanford and Merton,''



the ``Children's Magazine,'' and the like.  I now



think it a pity that I was not allowed to read, instead of



these, the novels of Scott and Cooper, which I discovered



later.  I devoutly thank Heaven that no such thing as



a sensation newspaper was ever brought into the house,--



even if there were one at that time,--which I doubt.  As



to physical recreation, there was plenty during the summer



in the fields and woods, and during the winter in



coasting, building huts in the deep snow, and in storming



or defending the snow forts on the village green.  One



of these childish sports had a historical connection with



a period which now seems very far away.  If any old



settler happened to pass during our snow-balling or



our shooting with bows and arrows, he was sure to look



on with interest, and, at some good shot, to cry out,--



``SHOOT BURGOYNE!''--thus recalling his remembrances



of the sharpshooters who brought about the great



surrender at Saratoga.







In my seventh year my father was called to take charge



of the new bank established at Syracuse, thirty miles



distant, and there the family soon joined him.  I remember



that coming through the Indian Reservation, on the road



between the two villages, I was greatly impressed by the



bowers and other decorations which had been used



shortly before at the installation of a new Indian chief. 



It was the headquarters of the Onondagas,--formerly the



great central tribe of the Iroquois,--the warlike confederacy



of the Six Nations; and as, in a general way, the



story was told me on that beautiful day in September a



new world of romance was opened to me, so that Indian



stories, and especially Cooper's novels, when I was



allowed to read them, took on a new reality.







Syracuse, which is now a city of one hundred and



twenty thousand inhabitants, was then a straggling



village of about five thousand.  After much time lost in



sundry poor ``select schools'' I was sent to one of the



public schools which was very good, and thence, when



about twelve years old, to the preparatory department



of the Syracuse Academy.







There, by good luck, was Joseph A. Allen, the best



teacher of English branches I have ever known.  He had



no rules and no system; or, rather, his rule was to have



no rules, and his system was to have no system.  To



genius.  He seemed to divine the character and enter into



the purpose of every boy.  Work under him was a pleasure. 



His methods were very simple.  Great attention



was given to reading aloud from a book made up of



selections from the best authors, and to recitals from these. 



Thus I stored up not only some of the best things in



the older English writers, but inspiring poems of Bryant,



Whittier, Longfellow, and other moderns.  My only regret



is that more of this was not given us.  I recall, among



treasures thus gained, which have been precious to me



ever since, in many a weary or sleepless hour on land



and sea, extracts from Shakspere, parts of Milton's



``Samson Agonistes,'' and of his sonnets; Gray's



``Elegy,'' Byron's ``Ode to the Ocean,'' Campbell's



``What's Hallowed Ground?'' Goldsmith's ``Deserted



Village,'' Longfellow's ``Psalm of Life,'' Irving's ``Voyage



to Europe,'' and parts of Webster's ``Reply to Hayne.''







At this school the wretched bugbear of English spelling



was dealt with by a method which, so long as our present



monstrous orthography continues, seems to me the



best possible.  During the last half-hour of every day,



each scholar was required to have before him a copy-



book, of which each page was divided into two columns. 



At the head of the first column was the word ``Spelling'';



at the head of the second column was the word ``Corrected.'' 



The teacher then gave out to the school about



twenty of the more important words in the reading-



lesson of the day, and, as he thus dictated each word, each



scholar wrote it in the column headed ``Spelling.''  When



all the words were thus written, the first scholar was asked



to spell from his book the first word; if misspelled, it



was passed to the next, and so on until it was spelled



correctly; whereupon all who had made a mistake in writing



it made the proper correction on the opposite column. 



The result of this was that the greater part of us learned



orthography PRACTICALLY.  For the practical use of spelling



comes in writing.







The only mistake in Mr. Allen's teaching was too much



attention to English grammar.  The order ought to be,



literature first, and grammar afterward.  Perhaps there



is no more tiresome trifling in the world for boys and



girls than rote recitations and parsing from one of the



usual grammatical text-books.







As to mathematics, arithmetic was, perhaps, pushed



too far into puzzles; but geometry was made fascinating



by showing its real applications and the beauty of its



reasoning.  It is the only mathematical study I ever loved. 



In natural science, though most of the apparatus of



schools nowadays was wanting, Mr. Allen's instruction



was far beyond his time.  Never shall I forget my excited



interest when, occasionally, the village surgeon came



in, and the whole school was assembled to see him dissect



the eye or ear or heart of an ox.  Physics, as then



understood, was studied in a text-book, but there was



illustration by simple apparatus, which fastened firmly



in my mind the main facts and principles.







The best impulse by this means came from the principal



of the academy, Mr. Oren Root,--one of the pioneers



of American science, whose modesty alone stood in



the way of his fame.  I was too young to take direct



instruction from him, but the experiments which I saw him



perform led me, with one or two of my mates, to construct



an excellent electrical machine and subsidiary apparatus;



and with these, a small galvanic battery and an extemporized



orrery, I diluted Professor Root's lectures with the



teachings of my little books on natural philosophy and



astronomy to meet the capacities of the younger boys in



our neighborhood.







Salient among my recollections of this period are the



cries and wailing of a newly-born babe in the rooms at



the academy occupied by the principal, and adjacent to



our big school-room.  Several decades of years later I had



the honor of speaking on the platform of Cooper Institute



in company with this babe, who, as I write, is, I believe,



the very energetic Secretary of War in the Cabinet



of President McKinley.







Unfortunately for me, Mr. Root was soon afterward



called away to a professorship at Hamilton College, and



so, though living in the best of all regions for geological



study, I was never properly grounded in that science, and



as to botany, I am to this hour utterly ignorant of its



simplest facts and principles.  I count this as one of the



mistakes in my education,--resulting in the loss of much



valuable knowledge and high pleasure.







As to physical development, every reasonable encouragement



was given to play.  Mr. Allen himself came frequently



to the play-grounds.  He was an excellent musician



and a most helpful influence was exerted by singing,



which was a daily exercise of the school.  I then began



taking lessons regularly in music and became proficient



enough to play the organ occasionally in church; the best



result of this training being that it gave my life one of its



deepest, purest, and most lasting pleasures.







On the moral side, Mr. Allen influenced many of



us by liberalizing and broadening our horizon.  He was



a disciple of Channing and an abolitionist, and, though he



never made the slightest attempt to proselyte any of his



scholars, the very atmosphere of the school made sectarian



bigotry impossible.







As to my general education outside the school I browsed



about as best I could.  My passion in those days was for



machinery, and, above all, for steam machinery.  The



stationary and locomotive engines upon the newly-



established railways toward Albany on the east and Buffalo



on the west especially aroused my attention, and I came to



know every locomotive, its history, character, and capabilities,



as well as every stationary engine in the whole region. 



My holiday excursions, when not employed in boating



or skating on the Onondaga Creek, or upon the lake,



were usually devoted to visiting workshops, where the



engine drivers and stokers seemed glad to talk with a



youngster who took an interest in their business.  Especially



interested was I in a rotary engine on ``Barker's



centrifugal principle,'' with which the inventor had prom-



ised to propel locomotives at the rate of a hundred miles



an hour, but which had been degraded to grinding bark in



a tannery.  I felt its disgrace keenly, as a piece of gross



injustice; but having obtained a small brass model, fitted



to it a tin boiler and placed it on a little stern-wheel boat,



I speedily discovered the secret of the indignity which



had overtaken the machine, for no boat could carry a



boiler large enough to supply steam for it.







So, too, I knew every water-wheel in that part of the



county, whether overshot, undershot, breast, or turbine. 



Everything in the nature of a motor had an especial



fascination for me, and for the men in control of such power



I entertained a respect which approached awe.







Among all these, my especial reverence was given to the



locomotive engineers; in my youthful mind they took on



a heroic character.  Often during the night watches I



thought of them as braving storm and peril, responsible



for priceless freights of human lives.  Their firm, keen



faces come back to me vividly through the mists of sixty



years, and to this day I look up to their successors at the



throttle with respectful admiration.







After Professor Root's departure the Syracuse Academy



greatly declined, Mr. Allen being the only strong



man left among its teachers, and, as I was to go



to college, I was removed to a ``classical school.''  This



school was not at first very successful.  Its teacher was



a good scholar but careless.  Under him I repeated the



grammatical forms and rules in Latin and Greek, glibly,



term after term, without really understanding their



value.  His great mistake, which seems to me a not



infrequent one, was taking it for granted that repeating



rules and forms means understanding them and their



application.  But a catastrophe came.  I had been promoted



beyond my deserts from a lower into an upper Latin class,



and at a public examination the Rev. Samuel Joseph



May, who was present, asked me a question, to which I



made an answer revealing utter ignorance of one of the



simplest principles of Latin grammar.  He was discon-



certed at the result, I still more so, and our preceptor most



of all.  That evening my father very solemnly asked me



about it.  I was mortified beyond expression, did not



sleep at all that night, and of my own accord, began



reviewing my Andrews and Stoddard thoroughly and



vigorously.  But this did not save the preceptor.  A



successor was called, a man who afterward became an



eminent Presbyterian divine and professor in a Southern



university, James W. Hoyt, one of the best and truest



of men, and his manly, moral influence over his scholars



was remarkable.  Many of them have reached positions of



usefulness, and I think they will agree that his influence



upon their lives was most happy.  The only drawback



was that he was still very young, not yet through his



senior year in Union College, and his methods in classical



teaching were imperfect.  He loved his classics and taught



his better students to love them, but he was neither



thorough in grammar, nor sure in translation, and this I



afterward found to my sorrow.  My friend and schoolmate



of that time, W. O. S., published a few years since,



in the ``St. Nicholas Magazine,'' an account of this school. 



It was somewhat idealized, but we doubtless agree in



thinking that the lack of grammatical drill was more than



made up by the love of manliness, and the dislike of



meanness, which was in those days our very atmosphere. 



Probably the best thing for my mental training was that



Mr. Hoyt interested me in my Virgil, Horace, and Xenophon,



and required me to write out my translations in the



best English at my command.







But to all his pupils he did not prove so helpful.  One



of them, though he has since become an energetic man



of business on the Pacific Coast, was certainly not helped



into his present position by his Latin; for of all the



translations I have ever heard or read of, one of his was the



worst.  Being called to construe the first line of the



Aeneid, he proceeded as follows:







``Arma,--arms; virumque,--and a man; cano,--and a



dog.''  There was a roar, and Mr. Hoyt, though evidently



saddened, kept his temper.  He did not, like the great



and good Arnold of Rugby, under similar provocation,



knock the offender down with the text-book.







Still another agency in my development was the debating



club, so inevitable in an American village.  Its



discussions were sometimes pretentious and always crude,



but something was gained thereby.  I remember that one



of the subjects was stated as follows:  ``Which has done



most harm, intemperance or fanaticism.''  The debate



was without any striking feature until my schoolmate,



W. O. S., brought up heavy artillery on the side of the



anti-fanatics: namely, a statement of the ruin wrought



by Mohammedanism in the East, and, above all, the



destruction of the great Alexandrian library by Caliph



Omar; and with such eloquence that all the argumentation



which any of us had learned in the temperance meetings



was paralyzed.







On another occasion we debated the question:  ``Was



the British Government justified in its treatment of



Napoleon Bonaparte?''  Much historical lore had been



brought to bear on the question, when an impassioned



young orator wound up a bitter diatribe against the great



emperor as follows:  ``The British Government WAS justified,



and if for no other reason, by the Emperor Napoleon's



murder of the `Duck de Engine' '' (Duc d'Enghien).







As to education outside of the school very important



to me had been the discovery, when I was about ten years



old, of `` `The Monastery,' by the author of `Waverley.' '' 



Who the ``author of `Waverley' '' was I neither knew nor



cared, but read the book three times, end over end, in a



sort of fascination.  Unfortunately, novels and romances



were kept under lock and key, as unfit reading for children,



and it was some years before I reveled in Scott's



other novels.  That they would have been thoroughly



good and wholesome reading for me I know, and about



my sixteenth year they opened a new world to me and



gave healthful play to my imagination.  I also read and



re-read Bunyan's ``Pilgrim's Progress,'' and, with plea-



sure even more intense, the earlier works of Dickens,



which were then appearing.







My only regret, as regards that time, is that, between the



rather trashy ``boys' books'' on one side and the rather



severe books in the family library on the other, I read



far less of really good literature than I ought to have



done.  My reading was absolutely without a guide, hence



fitful and scrappy; parts of Rollin's ``Ancient History''



and Lander's ``Travels in Africa'' being mixed up with



``Robinson Crusoe'' and ``The Scottish Chiefs.''  Reflection



on my experience has convinced me that some



kindly guidance in the reading of a fairly scholarly boy



is of the utmost importance, and never more so than now,



when books are so many and attractive.  I should lay



much stress, also, on the hearing of good literature well



read, and the interspersing of such reading with some



remarks by the reader, pointing out the main beauties



of the pieces thus presented.







About my tenth year occurred an event, apparently



trivial, but really very important in my mental



development during many years afterward.  My father



brought home one day, as a gift to my mother, a



handsome quarto called ``The Gallery of British Artists.'' 



It contained engravings from pictures by Turner, Stanfield,



Cattermole, and others, mainly representing scenes



from Shakspere, Scott, Burns, picturesque architecture,



and beautiful views in various parts of Europe.  Of this



book I never tired.  It aroused in me an intense desire



to know more of the subjects represented, and this desire



has led me since to visit and to study every cathedral,



church, and town hall of any historical or architectural



significance in Europe, outside the Spanish peninsula. 



But, far more important, it gave an especial zest to nearly



all Scott's novels, and especially to the one which I have



always thought the most fascinating, ``Quentin Durward.'' 



This novel led me later, not merely to visit Liege,



and Orl<e'>ans, and Cl<e'>ry, and Tours, but to devour the



chronicles and histories of that period, to become deeply



interested in historical studies, and to learn how great



principles lie hidden beneath the surface of events.  The



first of these principles I ever clearly discerned was



during my reading of ``Quentin Durward'' and ``Anne of



Geierstein,'' when there was revealed to me the secret



of the centralization of power in Europe, and of the



triumph of monarchy over feudalism.







In my sixteenth and seventeenth years another element



entered into my education.  Syracuse, as the central city



of the State, was the scene of many conventions and public



meetings.  That was a time of very deep earnestness in



political matters.  The last great efforts were making,



by the more radical, peaceably to prevent the extension



of slavery, and, by the more conservative, peaceably to



preserve the Union.  The former of these efforts interested



me most.  There were at Syracuse frequent public debates



between the various groups of the anti-slavery



party represented by such men as Gerrit Smith, Wendell



Phillips, William Lloyd Garrison, John Parker Hale,



Samuel Joseph May, and Frederick Douglass.  They took



strong hold upon me and gave me a higher idea of a man's



best work in life.  That was the bloom period of the old



popular lecture.  It was the time when lectures were



expected to build character and increase knowledge; the



sensation and buffoon business which destroyed the system



had not yet come in.  I feel to this hour the good



influence of lectures then heard, in the old City Hall at



Syracuse, from such men as President Mark Hopkins,



Bishop Alonzo Potter, Senator Hale of New Hampshire,



Emerson, Ware, Whipple, and many others.







As to recreative reading at this period, the author who



exercised the strongest influence over me was Charles



Kingsley.  His novels ``Alton Locke'' and ``Yeast''



interested me greatly in efforts for doing away with old



abuses in Europe, and his ``Two Years After'' increased



my hatred for negro slavery in America.  His ``Westward



Ho!'' extended my knowledge of the Elizabethan



period and increased my manliness.  Of this period, too,



was my reading of Lowell's Poems, many of which I



greatly enjoyed.  His ``Biglow Papers'' were a perpetual



delight; the dialect was familiar to me since, in the



little New England town transplanted into the heart of



central New York, in which I was born, the less educated



people used it, and the dry and droll Yankee expressions



of our ``help'' and ``hired man'' were a source of



constant amusement in the family.







In my seventeenth year came a trial.  My father had



taken a leading part in establishing a parish school for



St. Paul's church in Syracuse, in accordance with the



High Church views of our rector, Dr. Gregory, and there



was finally called to the mastership a young candidate



for orders, a brilliant scholar and charming man, who has



since become an eminent bishop of the Protestant Episcopal



Church.  To him was intrusted my final preparation



for college.  I had always intended to enter one



of the larger New England universities, but my teacher



was naturally in favor of his Alma Mater, and the influence



of our bishop, Dr. de Lancey, being also thrown



powerfully into the scale, my father insisted on placing



me at a small Protestant Episcopal college in western



New York.  I went most reluctantly.  There were in the



faculty several excellent men, one of whom afterward



became a colleague of my own in Cornell University, and



proved of the greatest value to it.  Unfortunately, we of



the lower college classes could have very little instruction



from him; still there was good instruction from



others; the tutor in Greek, James Morrison Clarke, was



one of the best scholars I have ever known.







It was in the autumn of 1849 that I went into residence



at the little college and was assigned a very unprepossessing



room in a very ugly barrack.  Entering my new



quarters I soon discovered about me various cabalistic



signs, some of them evidently made by heating large iron



keys, and pressing them against the woodwork.  On



inquiring I found that the room had been occupied some



years before by no less a personage than Philip Spencer,



a member of the famous Spencer family of Albany, who,



having passed some years at this little college, and never



having been able to get out of the freshman class, had



gone to another institution of about the same grade, had



there founded a Greek letter fraternity which is now



widely spread among American universities, and then,



through the influence of his father, who was Secretary



of War, had been placed as a midshipman under



Commodore McKenzie on the brig-of-war Somers.  On the



coast of Africa a mutiny was discovered, and as, on



examination, young Spencer was found at the head of it,



and papers discovered in his cabin revealed the plan of



seizing the ship and using it in a career of piracy, the



young man, in spite of his connection with a member of



the Cabinet, was hanged at the yard-arm with two of his



associates.







The most curious relic of him at the college was



preserved in the library of the Hermean Society.  It was a



copy of ``The Pirates' Own Book'': a glorification of the



exploits of ``Blackbeard'' and other great freebooters,



profusely adorned with illustrations of their joys and



triumphs.  This volume bore on the fly-leaf the words,



``Presented to the Hermean Society by Philip Spencer,'' and



was in those days shown as a great curiosity.







The college was at its lowest ebb; of discipline there



was none; there were about forty students, the majority



of them, sons of wealthy churchmen, showing no inclination



to work and much tendency to dissipation.  The



authorities of the college could not afford to expel or even



offend a student.  for its endowment was so small that it



must have all the instruction fees possible, and must keep



on good terms with the wealthy fathers of its scapegrace



students.  The scapegraces soon found this out, and the



result was a little pandemonium.  Only about a dozen



of our number studied at all; the rest, by translations,



promptings, and evasions escaped without labor.  I have



had to do since, as student, professor, or lecturer, with



some half-dozen large universities at home and abroad,



and in all of these together have not seen so much



carousing and wild dissipation as I then saw in this little



``Church college'' of which the especial boast was that,



owing to the small number of its students, it was ``able



to exercise a direct Christian influence upon every young



man committed to its care.''







The evidences of this Christian influence were not clear. 



The president of the college, Dr. Benjamin Hale, was a



clergyman of the highest character; a good scholar, an



excellent preacher, and a wise administrator; but his



stature was very small, his girth very large, and his hair



very yellow.  When, then, on the thirteenth day of the



month, there was read at chapel from the Psalter the



words, ``And there was little Benjamin, their ruler,''



very irreverent demonstrations were often made by the



students, presumably engaged in worship; demonstrations



so mortifying, indeed, that at last the president frequently



substituted for the regular Psalms of the day one of the



beautiful ``Selections'' of Psalms which the American



Episcopal Church has so wisely incorporated into its



prayer-book.







But this was by no means the worst indignity which



these youth ``under direct Christian influence''



perpetrated upon their reverend instructors.  It was my



privilege to behold a professor, an excellent clergyman,



seeking to quell hideous riot in a student's room, buried under



a heap of carpets, mattresses, counterpanes, and blankets;



to see another clerical professor forced to retire through



the panel of a door under a shower of lexicons, boots, and



brushes, and to see even the president himself, on one



occasion, obliged to leave his lecture-room by a ladder from



a window, and, on another, kept at bay by a shower of



beer-bottles.







One favorite occupation was rolling cannon-balls along



the corridors at midnight, with frightful din and much



damage: a tutor, having one night been successful



in catching and confiscating two of these, pounced from



his door the next night upon a third; but this having



been heated nearly to redness and launched from a shovel,



the result was that he wore bandages upon his hands for



many days.







Most ingenious were the methods for ``training freshmen,''--



one of the mildest being the administration of



soot and water by a hose-pipe thrust through the broken



panel of a door.  Among general freaks I remember seeing



a horse turned into the chapel, and a stuffed wolf,



dressed in a surplice, placed upon the roof of that sacred



edifice.







But the most elaborate thing of the kind I ever saw



was the breaking up of a ``Second Adventist'' meeting



by a score of student roysterers.  An itinerant fanatic had



taken an old wooden meeting-house in the lower part



of the town, had set up on either side of the pulpit large



canvas representations of the man of brass with feet of



clay, and other portentous characters of the prophecies,



and then challenged the clergy to meet him in public



debate.  At the appointed time a body of college youth



appeared, most sober in habit and demure in manner,



having at their head ``Bill'' Howell of Black Rock and



``Tom'' Clark of Manlius, the two wildest miscreants in



the sophomore class, each over six feet tall, the latter



dressed as a respectable farmer, and the former as a



country clergyman, wearing a dress-coat, a white cravat,



a tall black hat wrapped in crape, leaning on a heavy,



ivory-knobbed cane, and carrying ostentatiously a Greek



Testament.  These disguised malefactors, having taken



their seats in the gallery directly facing the pulpit, the



lecturer expressed his ``satisfaction at seeing clergymen



present,'' and began his demonstrations.  For about five



minutes all went well; then ``Bill'' Howell solemnly arose



and, in a snuffling voice, asked permission to submit a few



texts from scripture.  Permission being granted, he put



on a huge pair of goggles, solemnly opened his Greek



Testament, read emphatically the first passage which attracted



his attention and impressively asked the lecturer what



he had to say to it.  At this, the lecturer, greatly puzzled,



asked what the reverend gentleman was reading.  Upon



this Howell read in New Testament Greek another utterly



irrelevant passage.  In reply the lecturer said, rather



roughly, ``If you will speak English I will answer you.'' 



At this Howell said with the most humble suavity, ``Do



I understand that the distinguished gentleman does not



recognize what I have been reading?''  The preacher



answered, ``I don't understand any such gibberish;



speak English.''  Thereupon Howell threw back his long



black hair and launched forth into eloquent denunciation



as follows:  ``Sir, is it possible that you come here to



interpret to us the Holy Bible and do not recognize the



language in which that blessed book was written?  Sir,



do you dare to call the very words of the Almighty



`gibberish?' ''  At this all was let loose; some students put



asafetida on the stove; others threw pigeon-shot against



the ceiling and windows, making a most appalling din,



and one wretch put in deadly work with a syringe thrust



through the canvas representation of the man of brass



with feet of clay.  But, alas, Constable John Dey had



recognized Howell and Clark, even amid their disguises. 



He had dealt with them too often before.  The next



tableau showed them, with their tall hats crushed over their



heads, belaboring John Dey and his myrmidons, and presently,



with half a dozen other ingenuous youth, they were



haled to the office of justice.  The young judge who



officiated on this occasion was none other than a personage



who will be mentioned with great respect more than



once in these reminiscences,--Charles James Folger,--



afterward my colleague in the State Senate, Chief Justice



of the State and Secretary of the Treasury of the United



States.  He had met Howell often, for they were members



of the same Greek letter fraternity,--the thrice illustrious



Sigma Phi,--and, only a few days before, Howell had



presented me to him; but there was no fraternal bond



visible now; justice was sternly implacable, and good



round fines were imposed upon all the culprits caught.







The philosophy of all this waywardness and dissipation



was very simple.  There was no other outlet for the animal



spirits of these youth.  Athletics were unknown; there



was no gymnasium, no ball-playing, and, though the college



was situated on the shore of one of the most beautiful



lakes in the world, no boating.  As regards my own personal



relation to this condition of things I have pictured, it



was more that of a good-natured spectator than of an active



accomplice.  My nearest friends were in the thick of



it, but my tastes kept me out of most of it.  I was fond of



books, and, in the little student's library in my college



building I reveled.  Moreover, I then began to accumulate



for myself the library which has since grown to such large



proportions.  Still the whole life of the place became more



and more unsatisfactory to me, and I determined, at any



cost, to escape from it and find some seat of learning where



there was less frolic and more study.















CHAPTER II







YALE AND EUROPE--1850-1857







At the close of my year at the little Western New York



College I felt that it was enough time wasted, and,



anxious to try for something better, urged upon my father



my desire to go to one of the larger New England universities. 



But to this he would not listen.  He was assured by



the authorities of the little college that I had been doing



well, and his churchmanship, as well as his respect for the



bishop, led him to do what was very unusual with him--to



refuse my request.  Up to this period he had allowed me to



take my own course; but now he was determined that I



should take his.  He was one of the kindest of men, but he



had stern ideas as to proper subordination, and these he



felt it his duty to maintain.  I was obliged to make a coup



d'<e'>tat, and for a time it cost me dear.  Braving the



censure of family and friends, in the early autumn of 1850 I



deliberately left the college, and took refuge with my old



instructor P----, who had prepared me for college at



Syracuse, and who was now principal of the academy at



Moravia, near the head of Owasco Lake, some fifty miles



distant.  To thus defy the wishes of those dearest to me



was a serious matter.  My father at first took it deeply to



heart.  His letters were very severe.  He thought my



career wrecked, avowed that he had lost all interest in it,



and declared that he would rather have received news of



my death than of such a disgrace.  But I knew that my dear



mother was on my side.  Her letters remained as affectionate



as ever; and I determined to atone for my disobe-



dience by severe and systematic work.  I began to study



more earnestly than ever before, reviewed my mathematics



and classics vigorously, and began a course of reading



which has had great influence on all my life since. 



Among my books was D'Aubigne's ``History of the Reformation.'' 



Its deficiencies were not of a sort to harm me,



its vigor and enthusiasm gave me a great impulse.  I not



only read but studied it, and followed it with every other



book on the subject that I could find.  No reading ever did



a man more good.  It not only strengthened and deepened



my better purposes, but it continued powerfully the impulse



given me by the historical novels of Scott, and led



directly to my devoting myself to the study and teaching



of modern history.  Of other books which influenced me



about this period, Emerson's ``Representative Men'' was



one; another was Carlyle's ``Past and Present,'' in which



the old Abbot of Bury became one of my ideals; still



another was Buskin's ``Seven Lamps of Architecture'';



and to such a degree that this art has given to my life some



of its greatest pleasures.  Ruskin was then at his best. 



He had not yet been swept from his bearings by popular



applause, or intoxicated by his own verbosity.  In later



years he lost all influence over me, for, in spite of his



wonderful style, he became trivial, whimsical, peevish,



goody-goody;--talking to grown men and women as a



dyspeptic Sunday-school teacher might lay down the



law to classes of little girls.  As regards this later



period, Max Nordau is undoubtedly right in speaking of



Ruskin's mind as ``turbid and fallacious''; but the time



of which I speak was his best, and his influence upon



me was good.  I remember especially that his ``Lamp



of Power'' made a very deep impression upon me.  Carlyle,



too, was at his best.  He was the simple, strong



preacher;--with nothing of the spoiled cynic he afterward



became.







The stay of three months with my friend--the future



bishop--in the little country town, was also good for me



physically.  In our hours of recreation we roamed through



the neighboring woods, shooting squirrels and pigeons



with excellent effect on my health.  Meantime I kept up



my correspondence with all the members of the family



save my father;--from him there was no sign.  But at last



came a piece of good news.  He was very fond of music,



and on the arrival of Jenny Lind in the United States he



went to New York to attend her concerts.  During one of



these my mother turned suddenly toward him and said: 



``What a pity that the boy cannot hear this; how he would



enjoy it!''  My father answered, ``Tell him to come



home and see us.''  My mother, of course, was not slow in



writing me, and a few days later my father cordially



greeted my home-coming, and all difficulties seemed over. 



Shortly after Christmas he started with me for Yale; but



there soon appeared a lion in the path.  Our route lay



through Hartford, the seat of Trinity College, and to my



consternation I found at the last moment that he had



letters from our rector and others to the president and



professors of that institution.  Still more alarming, we



had hardly entered the train when my father discovered



a Trinity student on board.  Of course, the youth spoke



in the highest terms of his college and of his faculty, and



more and more my father was pleased with the idea of



staying a day or two at Hartford, taking a look at Trinity,



and presenting our letters of introduction.  During a



considerably extended career in the diplomatic service I have



had various occasions to exercise tact, care, and discretion,



but I do not think that my efforts on all these together



equaled those which I then put forth to avoid stopping



at Hartford.  At last my father asked me, rather severely,



why I cared so much about going to New Haven, and I



framed an answer offhand to meet the case, saying that



Yale had an infinitely finer library than Trinity.  Thereupon



he said, ``My boy, if you will go to Trinity College



I will give you the best private library in the United



States.''  I said, ``No, I am going to New Haven; I started



for New Haven, and I will go there.''  I had never braved



him before.  He said not a word.  We passed quietly



through Hartford, and a day or two later I was entered



at Yale.







It was a happy change.  I respected the institution, for



its discipline, though at times harsh, was, on the whole,



just, and thereby came a great gain to my own self-respect. 



But as to the education given, never was a man more



disappointed at first.  The president and professors were



men of high character and attainments; but to the lower



classes the instruction was given almost entirely by tutors,



who took up teaching for bread-winning while going



through the divinity school.  Naturally most of the



work done under these was perfunctory.  There was too



much reciting by rote and too little real intercourse



between teacher and taught.  The instructor sat in a box,



heard students' translations without indicating anything



better, and their answers to questions with very few



suggestions or remarks.  The first text-book in Greek was



Xenophon's ``Memorabilia,'' and one of the first men



called up was my classmate Delano Goddard.  He made an



excellent translation,--clean, clear, in thoroughly good



English; but he elicited no attention from the instructor,



and was then put through sundry grammatical puzzles,



among which he floundered until stopped by the word,



``Sufficient.''  Soon afterward another was called up who



rattled off glibly a translation without one particle of



literary merit, and was then plied with the usual grammatical



questions.  Being asked to ``synopsize'' the Greek verb,



he went through the various moods and tenses, in all sorts



of ways and in all possible combinations, his tongue



rattling like the clapper of a mill.  When he sat down my



next neighbor said to me, ``that man will be our



valedictorian.''  This disgusted me.  If that was the style of



classical scholarship at Yale, I knew that there was nothing



in it for me.  It turned out as my friend said.  That



glib reciter did become the valedictorian of the class, but



stepped from the commencement stage into nothingness,



and was never heard of more.  Goddard became the



editor of one of the most important metropolitan news-



papers of the United States, and, before his early death,



distinguished himself as a writer on political and historical



topics.







Nor was it any better in Latin.  We were reading, during



that term the ``De Senectute'' of Cicero,--a beautiful



book; but to our tutor it was neither more nor less than



a series of pegs on which to hang Zumpt's rules for the



subjunctive mood.  The translation was hurried through,



as of little account.  Then came questions regarding the



subjunctives;--questions to which very few members of



the class gave any real attention.  The best Latin scholar



in the class, G. W. S----, since so distinguished as the



London correspondent of the ``New York Tribune,'' and,



at present, as the New York correspondent of the London



``Times,'' having one day announced to some of us,--with



a very round expletive,--that he would answer no more



such foolish questions, the tutor soon discovered his



recalcitrancy, and thenceforward plied him with such



questions and nothing else.  S---- always answered that he



was not prepared on them; with the result that at the



Junior Exhibition he received no place on the programme.







In the junior year matters improved somewhat; but,



though the professors were most of them really distinguished



men, and one at least, James Hadley, a scholar



who, at Berlin or Leipsic, would have drawn throngs of



students from all Christendom, they were fettered by a



system which made everything of gerund-grinding and



nothing of literature.







The worst feature of the junior year was the fact that



through two terms, during five hours each week, ``recitations''



were heard by a tutor in ``Olmsted's Natural Philosophy.'' 



The text-book was simply repeated by rote.  Not



one student in fifty took the least interest in it; and



the man who could give the words of the text most glibly



secured the best marks.  One exceedingly unfortunate



result of this kind of instruction was that it so disgusted



the class with the whole subject, that the really excellent



lectures of Professor Olmsted, illustrated by probably



the best apparatus then possessed by any American



university, were voted a bore.  Almost as bad was the



historical instruction given by Professor James Hadley.  It



consisted simply in hearing the student repeat from memory



the dates from ``P<u:>tz's Ancient History.''  How a man



so gifted as Hadley could have allowed any part of his



work to be so worthless, it is hard to understand.  And,



worse remained behind.  He had charge of the class in



Thucydides; but with every gift for making it a means



of great good to us, he taught it in the perfunctory way of



that period;--calling on each student to construe a few



lines, asking a few grammatical questions, and then, with



hardly ever a note or comment, allowing him to sit down. 



Two or three times during a term something would occur



to draw Hadley out, and then it delighted us all to hear



him.  I recall, to this hour, with the utmost pleasure, some



of his remarks which threw bright light into the general



subject; but alas! they were few and far between.







The same thing must be said of Professor Thatcher's



instruction in Tacitus.  It was always the same mechanical



sort of thing, with, occasionally, a few remarks which



really aroused interest.







In the senior year the influence of President Woolsey



and Professor Porter was strong for good.  Though the



``Yale system'' fettered them somewhat, their personality



often broke through it.  Yet it amazes me to remember



that during a considerable portion of our senior year no



less a man than Woolsey gave instruction in history by



hearing men recite the words of a text-book;--and that



text-book the Rev. John Lord's little, popular treatise



on the ``Modern History of Europe!''  Far better was



Woolsey's instruction in Guizot.  That was stimulating. 



It not only gave some knowledge of history, but suggested



thought upon it.  In this he was at his best.  He had not



at that time begun his new career as a professor of



International Law, and that subject was treated by a kindly



old governor of the State, in a brief course of instruction,



which was, on the whole, rather inadequate.  Professor



Porter's instruction in philosophy opened our eyes and



led us to do some thinking for ourselves.  In political



economy, during the senior year, President Woolsey heard the



senior class ``recite'' from Wayland's small treatise,



which was simply an abridged presentation of the Manchester



view, the most valuable part of this instruction



being the remarks by Woolsey himself, who discussed



controverted questions briefly but well.  He also delivered,



during one term, a course of lectures upon the historical



relations between the German States, which had some



interest, but, not being connected with our previous



instruction, took little hold upon us.  As to natural science,



we had in chemistry and geology, doubtless, the best



courses then offered in the United States.  The first was



given by Benjamin Silliman, the elder, an American pioneer



in science, and a really great character; the second,



by James Dwight Dana, and in his lecture-room one felt



himself in the hands of a master.  I cannot forgive myself



for having yielded to the general indifference of the



class toward all this instruction.  It was listlessly heard,



and grievously neglected.  The fault was mainly our own;



--but it was partly due to ``The System,'' which led



students to neglect all studies which did not tell upon



``marks'' and ``standing.''







Strange to say, there was not, during my whole course



at Yale, a lecture upon any period, subject, or person in



literature, ancient or modern:--our only resource, in this



field, being the popular lecture courses in the town each



winter, which generally contained one or two presentations



of literary subjects.  Of these, that which made the



greatest impression upon me was by Ralph Waldo Emerson. 



Sundry lectures in my junior year, by Whipple, and



at a later period by George William Curtis, also influenced



me.  It was one of the golden periods of English literature,



the climax of the Victorian epoch;--the period of



Wordsworth, Tennyson, and the Brownings, of Thackeray



and Dickens, of Macaulay and Carlyle on one side



of the Atlantic, and of Emerson, Irving, Hawthorne, Ban-



croft, Prescott, Motley, Lowell, Longfellow, Horace



Bushnell, and their compeers on the other.  Hence came strong



influences; but in dealing with them we were left to ourselves.







Very important in shaping my intellectual development



at this time were my fellow-students.  The class of 1853



was a very large one for that day, and embraced far more



than the usual proportion of active-minded men.  Walks



and talks with these were of great value to me; thence



came some of my best impulses and suggestions to reading



and thought.







Especially fortunate was I in my ``chum,'' the friend



that stood closest to me.  He was the most conservative



young man I ever knew, and at the very opposite pole



from me on every conceivable subject.  But his deeply



religious character, his thorough scholarship, and his real



devotion to my welfare, were very precious to me.  Our



very differences were useful, since they obliged me to



revise with especial care all my main convictions and



trains of thought.  He is now, at this present writing, the



Bishop of Michigan, and a most noble and affectionate



pastor of his flock.







The main subjects of interest to us all had a political



bearing.  Literature was considered as mainly subsidiary



to political discussion.  The great themes, in the minds



of those who tried to do any thinking, were connected with



the tremendous political struggle then drawing toward



its climax in civil war.  Valuable to me was my membership



of sundry student fraternities.  They were vealy,



but there was some nourishment in them; by far the best



of all being a senior club which, though it had adopted



a hideous emblem, was devoted to offhand discussions of



social and political questions;--on the whole, the best club



I have ever known.







The studies which interested me most were political and



historical; from classical studies the gerund-grinding and



reciting by rote had completely weaned me.  One of our



Latin tutors, having said to me:  ``If you would try you



could become a first-rate classical scholar,'' I answered:



``Mr. B----, I have no ambition to become a classical



scholar, as scholarship is understood here.''







I devoted myself all the more assiduously to study on



my own lines, especially in connection with the subjects



taught by President Woolsey in the senior year, and the



one thing which encouraged me was that, at the public



reading of essays, mine seemed to interest the class.  Yet



my first trial of strength with my classmates in this



respect did not apparently turn out very well.  It was at



a prize debate, in one of the large open societies, but



while I had prepared my speech with care, I had given



no thought to its presentation, and, as a result, the judges



passed me by.  Next day a tutor told me that Professor



Porter wished to see me.  He had been one of the judges,



but it never occurred to me that he could have summoned



me for anything save some transgression of college rules. 



But, on my arrival at his room, he began discussing my



speech, said some very kind things of its matter, alluded



to some defects in its manner, and all with a kindness



which won my heart.  Thus began a warm personal friendship



which lasted through his professorship and presidency



to the end of his life.  His kindly criticism was



worth everything to me; it did far more for me than any



prize could have done.  Few professors realize how much



a little friendly recognition may do for a student.  To



this hour I bless Dr. Porter's memory.







Nor did my second effort, a competition in essay-writing,



turn out much better.  My essay was too labored, too



long, too crabbedly written, and it brought me only half



a third prize.







This was in the sophomore year.  But in the junior year



came a far more important competition; that for the Yale



Literary Gold Medal, and without any notice of my



intention to any person, I determined to try for it.  Being



open to the entire university, the universal expectation



was that it would be awarded to a senior, as had hitherto



been the case, and speculations were rife as to what mem-



ber of the graduating class would take it.  When the committee



made their award to the essay on ``The Greater



Distinctions in Statesmanship,'' opened the sealed



envelopes and assigned the prize to me, a junior, there was



great surprise.  The encouragement came to me just at



the right time, and did me great good.  Later, there were



awarded to me the first Clarke Prize for the discussion



of a political subject, and the De Forest Gold Medal, then



the most important premium awarded in the university,



my subject being, ``The Diplomatic History of Modern



Times.''  Some details regarding this latter success may



serve to show certain ways in which influence can be



exerted powerfully upon a young man.  The subject had



been suggested to me by hearing Edwin Forrest in Bulwer's



drama of ``Richelieu.''  The character of the great



cardinal, the greatest statesman that France has produced,



made a deep impression upon me, and suggested the



subjects in both the Yale Literary and the De Forest



competitions, giving me not only the initial impulse, but



maintaining that interest to which my success was largely due. 



Another spur to success was even more effective.  Having



one day received a telegram from my father, asking me



to meet him in New York, I did so, and passed an hour



with him, all the time at a loss to know why he had sent



for me.  But, finally, just as I was leaving the hotel to



return to New Haven, he said, ``By the way, there is still



another prize to be competed for, the largest of all.'' 



``Yes,'' I answered, ``the De Forest; but I have little



chance for that; for though I shall probably be one of the



six Townsend prize men admitted to the competition, there



are other speakers so much better, that I have little hope



of taking it.''  He gave me rather a contemptuous look,



and said, somewhat scornfully:  ``If I were one of the first



SIX competitors, in a class of over a hundred men, I would



try hard to be the first ONE.''  That was all.  He said



nothing more, except good-bye.  On my way to New Haven



I thought much of this, and on arriving, went to a student,



who had some reputation as an elocutionist, and engaged



him for a course in vocal gymnastics.  When he wished



me to recite my oration before him, I declined, saying that



it must be spoken in my own way, not in his; that his



way might be better, but that mine was my own, and I



would have no other.  He confined himself, therefore, to



a course of vocal gymnastics, and the result was a



surprise to myself and all my friends.  My voice, from



being weak and hollow, became round, strong, and flexible. 



I then went to a student in the class above my own, a



natural and forcible speaker, and made an arrangement



with him to hear me pronounce my oration, from time to



time, and to criticize it in a common-sense way.  This he



did.  At passages where he thought my manner wrong,



he raised his finger, gave me an imitation of my manner,



then gave the passage in the way he thought best, and



allowed me to choose between his and mine.  The result was



that, at the public competition, I was successful.  This



experience taught me what I conceive to be the true theory



of elocutionary training in our universities--vocal



gymnastics, on one side; common-sense criticism, on the other.







As to my physical education: with a constitution far



from robust, there was need of special care.  Fortunately,



I took to boating.  In an eight-oared boat, spinning down



the harbor or up the river, with G. W. S---- at the stroke



--as earnest and determined in the Undine then as in the



New York office of the London ``Times'' now, every condition



was satisfied for bodily exercise and mental recreation. 



I cannot refrain from mentioning that our club sent



the first challenge to row that ever passed between Yale



and Harvard, even though I am obliged to confess that we



were soundly beaten; but neither that defeat at Lake



Quinsigamond, nor the many absurdities which have grown out



of such competitions since, have prevented my remaining



an apostle of college boating from that day to this.  If



guarded by common-sense rules enforced with firmness



by college faculties, it gives the maximum of healthful



exercise, with a minimum of danger.  The most detestable



product of college life is the sickly cynic; and a thor-



ough course in boating, under a good stroke oar, does as



much as anything to make him impossible.







At the close of my undergraduate life at Yale I went



abroad for nearly three years, and fortunately had, for



a time, one of the best of companions, my college mate,



Gilman, later president of Johns Hopkins University, and



now of the Carnegie Institution, who was then, as he has



been ever since, a source of good inspirations to me,--



especially in the formation of my ideas regarding



education.  During the few weeks I then passed in England I



saw much which broadened my views in various ways. 



History was made alive to me by rapid studies of persons



and places while traveling, and especially was this the



case during a short visit to Oxford, where I received some



strong impressions, which will be referred to in another



chapter.  Dining at Christ Church with Osborne Gordon,



an eminent tutor of that period, I was especially interested



in his accounts of John Ruskin, who had been his pupil. 



Then, and afterward, while enjoying the hospitalities of



various colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, I saw the



excellencies of their tutorial system, but also had my eyes



opened to some of their deficiencies.







Going thence to Paris I settled down in the family of



a very intelligent French professor, where I remained



nearly a year.  Not a word of English was spoken in the



family; and, with the daily lesson in a French method,



and lectures at the Sorbonne and Coll<e!>ge de France, the



new language soon became familiar.  The lectures then



heard strengthened my conception of what a university



should be.  Among my professors were such men as St.



Marc Girardin, Arnould, and, at a later period, Laboulaye. 



In connection with the lecture-room work, my studies in



modern history were continued, especially by reading Guizot,



Thierry, Mignet, Thiers, Ch<a^>teaubriand, and others,



besides hearing various masterpieces in French dramatic



literature, as given at the Th<e'><a^>tre Fran<c,>ais, where



Rachel was then in her glory, and at the Od<e'>on, where Mlle.



Georges, who had begun her career under the first Napoleon,



was ending it under Napoleon III.







My favorite subject of study was the French Revolution,



and, in the intervals of reading and lectures, I sought



out not only the spots noted in its history, but the men



who had taken part in it.  At the H<o^>tel des Invalides I



talked with old soldiers, veterans of the Republic and of



the Napoleonic period, discussing with them the events



through which they had passed; and, at various other



places and times, with civilians who had heard orations



at the Jacobin and Cordelier clubs, and had seen the



guillotine at work.  The most interesting of my old soldiers



at the Invalides wore upon his breast the cross of the



Legion of Honor, which he had received from Napoleon



at Austerlitz.  Still another had made the frightful



marches through the Spanish Peninsula under Soult, and



evidently felt very humble in the presence of those who



had taken part in the more famous campaigns under Napoleon



himself.  The history of another of my old soldiers



was pathetic.  He was led daily into the cabaret, where my



guests were wont to fight their battles o'er again, his eyes



absolutely sightless, and his hair as white as snow.  Getting



into conversation with him I learned that he had gone



to Egypt with Bonaparte, had fought at the Battle of the



Pyramids, had been blinded by the glaring sun on the



sand of the desert, and had been an inmate at the Invalides



ever since;--more than half a century.  At a later period



I heard from another of my acquaintances how, as a



schoolboy, he saw Napoleon beside his camp-fire at



Cannes, just after his landing from Elba.







There still remained at Paris, in those days, one main



connecting link between the second empire and the first,



and this was the most contemptible of all the Bonapartes,--



the younger brother of the great Napoleon,--



J<e'>rome, ex-king of Westphalia.  I saw him, from time to



time, and was much struck by his resemblance to the first



emperor.  Though taller, he still had something of that



Roman imperial look, so remarkable in the founder of the



family; but in J<e'>rome, it always recalled to me such



Caesars as Tiberius and Vitellius.







It was well known that the ex-king, as well as his son,



Prince J<e'>rome Napoleon, were thorns in the side of



Napoleon III, and many stories illustrating this were



current during my stay in Paris, the best, perhaps, being an



answer made by Napoleon III to another representative



of his family.  The question having been asked, ``What



is the difference between an accident and a misfortune



(un accident et un malheur)?'' the emperor answered. 



``If my cousin, Prince Napoleon, should fall into the



Seine, it would be an ACCIDENT; if anybody were to pull him



out, it would be a MISFORTUNE.''  Although this cousin had



some oratorical ability, both he and his father were most



thoroughly despised.  The son bore the nickname of



``Plon-Plon,'' probably with some reference to his reputation



for cowardice; the father had won the appellation



of ``Le Roi Loustic,'' and, indeed, had the credit of



introducing into the French language the word ``loustic,''



derived from the fact that, during his short reign at Cassel,



King J<e'>rome was wont, after the nightly orgies at his



palace, to dismiss his courtiers with the words:  ``Morgen



wieder loustic, Messieurs.''







During the summer of 1854 I employed my vacation in



long walks and drives with a college classmate through



northern, western, and central France, including Picardy,



Normandy, Brittany, and Touraine, visiting the spots



of most historical and architectural interest.  There were,



at that time, few railways in those regions, so we put on



blouses and took to the road, sending our light baggage



ahead of us, and carrying only knapsacks.  In every way



it proved a most valuable experience.  Pleasantly come



back to me my walks and talks with the peasantry, and



vividly dwell in my memory the cathedrals of Beauvais,



Amiens, Rouen, Bayeux, Coutances, Le Mans, Tours,



Chartres, and Orl<e'>ans, the fortress of Mont St. Michel,



the Ch<a^>teaux of Chenonceaux, Chambord, Nantes, Am-



boise, and Angers, the tombs of the Angevine kings at



Fontevrault, and the stone cottage of Louis XI at Cl<e'>ry. 



Visiting the grave of Ch<a^>teaubriand at St. Malo, we met



a little old gentleman, bent with age, but very brisk and



chatty.  He was standing with a party of friends on one



side of the tomb, while we stood on the other.  Presently,



one of the gentlemen in his company came over and asked



our names, saying that his aged companion was a great



admirer of Ch<a^>teaubriand, and was anxious to know something



of his fellow pilgrims.  To this I made answer, when



my interlocutor informed me that the old gentleman was



the Prince de Rohan-Soubise.  Shortly afterward the old



gentleman came round to us and began conversation, and



on my making answer in a way which showed that I knew



his title, he turned rather sharply on me and said, ``How



do you know that?''  To this I made answer that even



in America we had heard the verse:







        ``Roi, je ne puis,



          Prince ne daigne,



          Rohan je suis.''







At this he seemed greatly pleased, grasped my hand, and



launched at once into extended conversation.  His great



anxiety was to know who was to be the future king of



our Republic, and he asked especially whether Washington



had left any direct descendants.  On my answering in the



negative, he insisted that we would have to find some



descendant in the collateral line, ``for,'' said he, ``you can't



escape it; no nation can get along for any considerable



time without a monarch.''







Returning to Paris I resumed my studies, and, at the



request of Mr. Randall, the biographer of Jefferson,



made some search in the French archives for correspondence



between Jefferson and Robespierre,--search made



rather to put an end to calumny than for any other



purpose.







At the close of this stay in France, by the kindness of



the American minister to Russia, Governor Seymour, of



Connecticut, I was invited to St. Petersburg, as an attach<e'>



of the American Legation, and resided for over six months



in his household.  It was a most interesting period.  The



Crimean War was going on, and the death of the Emperor



Nicholas, during my stay, enabled me to see how a great



change in autocratic administration is accomplished.  An



important part of my duty was to accompany the minister



as an interpreter, not only at court, but in his interviews



with Nesselrode, Gortschakoff, and others then in power. 



This gave me some chance also to make my historical



studies more real by close observation of a certain sort



of men who have had the making of far too much history;



but books interested me none the less.  An epoch in my



development, intellectual and moral, was made at this time



by my reading large parts of Gibbon, and especially by



a very careful study of Guizot's ``History of Civilization



in France,'' which greatly deepened and strengthened the



impression made by his ``History of Civilization in



Europe,'' as read under President Woolsey at Yale.  During



those seven months in St. Petersburg and Moscow, I read



much in modern European history, paying considerable



attention to the political development and condition of



Russia, and, for the first time, learned the pleasures of



investigating the history of our own country.  Governor



Seymour was especially devoted to the ideas of Thomas



Jefferson, and late at night, as we sat before the fire, after



returning from festivities or official interviews, we



frequently discussed the democratic system, as advocated by



Jefferson, and the autocratic system, as we saw it in the



capital of the Czar.  The result was that my beginning



of real study in American history was made by a very



close examination of the life and writings of Thomas



Jefferson, including his letters, messages, and other papers,



and of the diplomatic history revealed in the volumes of



correspondence preserved in the Legation.  The general



result was to strengthen and deepen my democratic creed,



and a special result was the preparation of an article on



``Jefferson and Slavery,'' which, having been at a later



period refused by the ``New Englander,'' at New Haven,



on account of its too pronounced sympathy with democracy



against federalism, was published by the ``Atlantic



Monthly,'' and led to some acquaintances of value to me



afterward.







Returning from St. Petersburg, I was matriculated at



the University of Berlin, and entered the family of a



very scholarly gymnasial professor, where nothing but



German was spoken.  During this stay at the Prussian



capital, in the years 1855 and 1856, I heard the lectures of



Lepsius, on Egyptology; August Boeckh, on the History



of Greece; Friedrich von Raumer, on the History of Italy;



Hirsch, on Modern History in general; and Carl Ritter,



on Physical Geography.  The lectures of Ranke, the most



eminent of German historians, I could not follow.  He had



a habit of becoming so absorbed in his subject, as to slide



down in his chair, hold his finger up toward the ceiling,



and then, with his eye fastened on the tip of it, to go



mumbling through a kind of rhapsody, which most of my



German fellow-students confessed they could not understand. 



It was a comical sight: half a dozen students



crowding around his desk, listening as priests might listen



to the sibyl on her tripod, the other students being



scattered through the room, in various stages of



discouragement.  My studies at this period were mainly in the



direction of history, though with considerable reading on



art and literature.  Valuable and interesting to me at this



time were the representations of the best dramas of Goethe,



Schiller, Lessing, and Gutzkow, at the Berlin theaters. 



Then, too, really began my education in Shakspere, and



the representations of his plays (in Schlegel and Tieck's



version) were, on the whole, the most satisfactory I have



ever known.  I thus heard plays of Shakspere which, in



English-speaking countries, are never presented, and,



even into those better known, wonderful light was at times



thrown from this new point of view.







As to music, the Berlin Opera was then at the height



of its reputation, the leading singer being the famous



Joanna Wagner.  But my greatest satisfaction was derived



from the ``Liebig Classical Concerts.''  These were,



undoubtedly, the best instrumental music then given in



Europe, and a small party of us were very assiduous in



our attendance.  Three afternoons a week we were, as a



rule, gathered about our table in the garden where the



concerts were given, and, in the midst of us, Alexander



Thayer, the biographer of Beethoven, who discussed the



music with us during its intervals.  Beethoven was, for



him, the one personage in human history, and Beethoven's



music the only worthy object of human concern.  He knew



every composition, every note, every variant, and had



wrestled for years with their profound meanings.  Many



of his explanations were fantastic, but some were



suggestive and all were interesting.  Even more inspiring



was another new-found friend, Henry Simmons Frieze; a



thorough musician, and a most lovely character.  He



broached no theories, uttered no comments, but sat rapt



by the melody and harmony--transfigured--``his face as



it had been the face of an angel.''  In these Liebig



concerts we then heard, for the first time, the music of a



new composer,--one Wagner,--and agreed that while it



was all very strange, there was really something in the



overture to ``Tannh<a:>user.''







At the close of this stay in Berlin, I went with a party



of fellow-students through Austria to Italy.  The whole



journey was a delight, and the passage by steamer from



Trieste to Venice was made noteworthy by a new



acquaintance,--James Russell Lowell.  As he had already



written the ``Vision of Sir Launfal,'' the ``Fable for



Critics,'' and the ``Biglow Papers,'' I stood in great awe of



him; but this feeling rapidly disappeared in his genial



presence.  He was a student like the rest of us,--for



he had been passing the winter at Dresden, working



in German literature, as a preparation for succeeding



Longfellow in the professorship at Harvard.  He



came to our rooms, and there linger delightfully in



my memory his humorous accounts of Italian life as he



had known it.







During the whole of the journey, it was my exceeding



good fortune to be thrown into very close relations with



two of our party, both of whom became eminent Latin



professors, and one of whom,--already referred to,--



Frieze, from his lecture-room in the University of



Michigan, afterward did more than any other man within my



knowledge to make classical scholarship a means of culture



throughout our Western States.  My excursions in



Rome, under that guidance, I have always looked upon



as among the fortunate things of life.  The day was given



to exploration, the evening to discussion, not merely of



archaeological theories, but of the weightier matters



pertaining to the history of Roman civilization and its



influence.  Dear Frieze and Fishburne!  How vividly come



back the days in the tower of the Croce di Malta, at Genoa,



in our sky-parlor of the Piazza di Spagna at Rome, and



in the old ``Capuchin Hotel'' at Amalfi, when we held high



debate on the analogies between the Roman Empire and



the British, and upon various kindred subjects.







An episode, of much importance to me at this time,



was my meeting our American minister at Naples, Robert



Dale Owen.  His talks on the political state of Italy, and



his pictures of the monstrous despotism of ``King



Bomba'' took strong hold upon me.  Not even the pages



of Colletta or of Settembrini have done so much to arouse



in me a sense of the moral value of political history.







Then, too, I made the first of my many excursions



through the historic towns of Italy.  My reading of



Sismondi's ``Italian Republics'' had deeply interested me in



their history, and had peopled them again with their old



turbulent population.  I seemed to see going on before my



eyes the old struggle between Guelphs and Ghibellines,



and between the demagogues and the city tyrants.  In the



midst of such scenes my passion for historical reading



was strengthened, and the whole subject took on new and



deeper meanings.







On my way northward, excursions among the cities



of southern France, especially Nismes, Arles, and Orange,



gave me a far better conception of Roman imperial power



than could be obtained in Italy alone, and Avignon,



Bourges, and Toulouse deepened my conceptions of



mediaeval history.







Having returned to America in the summer of 1856



and met my class, assembled to take the master's degree



in course at Yale, I was urged by my old Yale friends,



especially by Porter and Gilman, to remain in New Haven. 



They virtually pledged me a position in the school of art



about to be established; but my belief was in the value



of historical studies, and I accepted an election to a



professorship of history at the University of Michigan.  The



work there was a joy to me from first to last, and my



relations with my students of that period, before I had



become distracted from them by the cares of an executive



position, were among the most delightful of my life. 



Then, perhaps, began the most real part of my education. 



The historical works of Buckle, Lecky, and Draper, which



were then appearing, gave me a new and fruitful impulse;



but most stimulating of all was the atmosphere coming



from the great thought of Darwin and Herbert Spencer,--



an atmosphere in which history became less and less a



matter of annals, and more and more a record of the



unfolding of humanity.  Then, too, was borne in upon



me the meaning of the proverb docendo disces.  I found



energetic Western men in my classes ready to discuss



historical questions, and discovered that in order to keep



up my part of the discussions, as well as to fit myself for



my class-room duties, I must work as I had never worked



before.  The education I then received from my classes at



the University of Michigan was perhaps the most effective



of all.























PART III







AS UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR















CHAPTER XV







LIFE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN--1857-1864







As I looked out upon the world during my childhood,



there loomed up within my little horizon certain



personages as ideals.  Foremost of these was the surpliced



clergyman of the parish.  So strong was my admiration



for him that my dear mother, during her entire life, never



relinquished the hope, and indeed the expectation, that I



would adopt the clerical profession.







Another object of my admiration--to whose profession



I aspired--was the village carpenter.  He ``did things,''



and from that day to this I have most admired the men



who ``do things.''







Yet another of these personages was the principal of



Cortland Academy.  As I saw him addressing his students,



or sitting in the midst of them observing with a telescope



the satellites of Jupiter, I was overawed.  A sense of my



littleness overcame me, and I hardly dared think of aspiring



to duties so exalted.







But at the age of seven a new ideal appeared.  The



family had removed from the little town where I was born



to Syracuse, then a rising village of about five thousand



inhabitants.  The railways, east and west, had just been



created,--the beginnings of what is now the New York



Central Railroad,--and every day, so far as possible, I



went down-town ``to see the cars go out.''  During a large



part of the year there was but one passenger-train in each



direction, and this was made up of but three or four small



compartment-cars drawn by a locomotive which would



now be considered ridiculously small, at the rate of twelve



to fifteen miles an hour.







Yet I doubt whether the express trains on the New York



Central, drawn by hundred-ton locomotives at a speed of



sixty miles an hour, produce on the youth of the present



generation anything like the impression made by those



simple beginnings.  The new personage who now attracted



my homage was the locomotive-driver.  To me his profession



transcended all others.  As he mounted the locomotive,



and especially as he pulled the starting-bar, all other



functions seemed insignificant.  Every day I contemplated



him; often I dreamed of him; saw him in my mind's



eye dashing through the dark night, through the rain and



hail, through drifting snow, through perils of ``wash-



outs'' and ``snake-heads,'' and no child in the middle ages



ever thought with more awe of a crusading knight leading



his troops to the Holy City than did I think of this hero



standing at his post in all weathers, conducting his train



to its destination beyond the distant hills.  It was indeed



the day of small things.  The traveler passing from New



York to Buffalo in those days changed from the steamer



at Albany to the train for Schenectady, there changed to



the train for Utica, thence took the train for Syracuse,



there stayed overnight, then took a train for Auburn,



where he found the train for Rochester, and after two more



changes arrived in Buffalo after a journey of two days



and a night, which is now made in from eight to ten hours.







But the locomotive-driver was none the less a personage,



and I must confess that my old feeling of respect for him



clings to me still.  To this hour I never see him controlling



his fiery steed without investing him with some of the



attributes which I discerned in him during my childhood. 



It is evident to me that the next heroes whom poets will



exploit will be the drivers of our railway trains and the pilots



of our ocean steamers.  One poet has, indeed, made a beginning



already,--and this poet the Secretary of State of the



United States under whom I am now serving, the Hon.



John Hay.  Still another poet, honored throughout the



world, has also found a hero in the engine-driver, and



Rudyard Kipling will no doubt be followed by others.







But my dream of becoming a locomotive-driver faded,



and while in college I speculated not a little as to what,



after all, should be my profession.  The idea of becoming



a clergyman had long since left my mind.  The medical



profession had never attracted me.  For the legal profession



I sought to prepare myself somewhat, but as I saw it



practised by the vast majority of lawyers, it seemed a



waste of all that was best in human life.  Politics were



from an early period repulsive to me, and, after my first



sight of Washington in its shabby, sleazy, dirty, unkempt



condition under the old slave oligarchy, political life



became absolutely repugnant to my tastes and desires.  At



times a longing came over me to settle down in the country,



to make an honest living from a farm--a longing



which took its origin in a visit which I had made as a child



to the farm of an uncle who lived upon the shores of



Seneca Lake.  He was a man of culture, who, by the aid



of a practical farmer and an income from other sources,



got along very well.  His roomy, old-fashioned house, his



pleasant library, his grounds sloping to the lake, his



peach-orchard, which at my visit was filled with delicious



fruit, and the pleasant paths through the neighboring



woods captivated me, and for several years the agricultural



profession lingered in my visions as the most attractive



of all.







As I now look back to my early manhood, it seems that



my natural inclination should have been toward journalism;



but although such a career proves attractive to many



of our best university-bred men now, it was not so then. 



In those days men did not prepare for it; they drifted



into it.  I do not think that at my graduation there was



one out of the one hundred and eight members of my class



who had the slightest expectation of permanently connecting



himself with a newspaper.  This seems all the more



singular since that class has since produced a large



number of prominent journalists, and among these George



Washburne Smalley, the most eminent, by far, among



American newspaper correspondents of our time; Evarts



Greene, a leading editor of Worcester; Delano Goddard,



late editor of the ``Boston Advertiser''; Kinsley Twining,



for a considerable time an editor of the ``Independent'';



Isaac Bromley, who for years delighted the Republican



party with his contributions to the editorial page of the



``Tribune''; Dr. James Morris Whiton, a leading writer



for the ``Outlook''; and others.  Yet in those days probably



not one of these ever thought of turning to journalism as



a career.  There were indeed at that time eminent editors,



like Weed, Croswell, Greeley, Raymond, and Webb, but



few college-bred men thought of journalism as a profession. 



Looking back upon all this, I feel certain that, were



I to begin life again with my present experience, that



would be the career for which I would endeavor to fit



myself.  It has in it at present many admirable men, but far



more who are manifestly unfit.  Its capacities for good or



evil are enormous, yet the majority of those at present in



it seem to me like savages who have found a watch.  I



can think of no profession in which young men properly



fitted--gifted with ideas and inspired by a real wish to do



something for their land and time--can more certainly do



good work and win distinction.  To supplant the present



race of journalistic prostitutes, who are making many of



our newspapers as foul in morals, as low in tone, and as



vile in utterance as even the worst of the French press,



might well be the ambition of leading thinkers in any of



our universities.  There is nothing so greatly needed in



our country as an uplifting of the daily press, and there



is no work promising better returns.







But during my student life in Paris and Berlin another



vista began to open before me.  I had never lost that



respect for the teaching profession which had been aroused



in my childhood by the sight of Principal Woolworth



enthroned among the students of Cortland Academy, and



this early impression was now greatly deepened by my



experience at the Sorbonne, the College of France, and the



University of Berlin.  My favorite studies at Yale had



been history and kindred subjects, but these had been



taught mainly from text-books.  Lectures were few and



dry.  Even those of President Woolsey were not inspiring;



he seemed paralyzed by the system of which he



formed a part.  But men like Arnould, St. Marc Girardin,



and Laboulaye in France, and Lepsius, Ritter, von Raumer,



and Curtius in Germany, lecturing to large bodies of



attentive students on the most interesting and instructive



periods of human history, aroused in me a new current of



ideas.  Gradually I began to ask myself the question:  Why



not help the beginnings of this system in the United States? 



I had long felt deeply the shortcomings of our American



universities, and had tried hard to devise something better;



yet my ideas as to what could really be done to improve



them had been crude and vague.  But now, in these great



foreign universities, one means of making a reform became



evident, and this was, first of all, the substitution of



lectures for recitations, and the creation of an interest



in history by treating it as a living subject having relations



to present questions.  Upon this I reflected much,



and day by day the idea grew upon me.  So far as I can



remember, there was not at that time a professor of history



pure and simple in any American university.  There



had been courses of historical lectures at a few institutions,



but they were, as a rule, spasmodic and perfunctory.  How



history was taught at Yale is shown in another chapter of



these reminiscences.  The lectures of President Sparks



had evidently trained up no school of historical professors



at Harvard.  There had been a noted professor at William



and Mary College, Virginia,--doubtless, in his time, the



best historical lecturer in the United States,--Dr. William



Dew, the notes of whose lectures, as afterward published,



were admirable; but he had left no successor.  Francis



Lieber, at the University of South Carolina, had taught



political philosophy with much depth of thought and



wealth of historical illustration; but neither there nor



elsewhere did there exist anything like systematic courses in



history such as have now been developed in so many of



our universities and colleges.







During my stay as resident graduate at Yale after my



return from Europe in 1856, I often discussed the subject



with my old friend and companion Gilman, now president



of the Carnegie Institution, and with my beloved instructor,



Professor Porter.  Both were kind enough to urge me



to remain at New Haven, assuring me that in time a



professorship would be established.  To promote this I wrote an



article on ``German Instruction in General History,''



which was well received when published in the ``New



Englander,'' and prepared sundry lectures, which were



received by the university people and by the New York press



more favorably than I now think they deserved.  But there



seemed, after all, no chance for a professorship devoted to



this line of study.  More and more, too, I felt that even if I



were called to a historical professorship at Yale, the old-



fashioned orthodoxy which then prevailed must fetter me:



I could not utter the shibboleths then demanded, and the



future seemed dark indeed.  Yet my belief in the value



of better historical instruction in our universities grew



more and more, and a most happy impulse was now given



to my thinking by a book which I read and reread--



Stanley's ``Life of Arnold.''  It showed me much, but



especially two things: first, how effective history might



be made in bringing young men into fruitful trains of



thought regarding present politics; and, secondly, how



real an influence an earnest teacher might thus exercise



upon his country.







While in this state of mind I met my class assembled at



the Yale commencement of 1856 to take the master's



degree in course, after the manner of those days.  This was



the turning-point with me.  I had been for some time more



and more uneasy and unhappy because my way did not



seem to clear; but at this commencement of 1856, while



lounging among my classmates in the college yard, I heard



some one say that President Wayland of Brown University



was addressing the graduates in the Hall of the Alumni. 



Going to the door, I looked in, and saw at the high table an



old man, strong-featured, heavy-browed, with spectacles



resting on the top of his head, and just at that moment he



spoke very impressively as follows:  ``The best field of



work for graduates is now in the WEST; our country is



shortly to arrive at a switching-off place for good or evil;



our Western States are to hold the balance of power in



the Union, and to determine whether the country shall



become a blessing or a curse in human history.''







I had never seen him before; I never saw him afterward. 



His speech lasted less than ten minutes, but it settled a



great question for me.  I went home and wrote to sundry



friends that I was a candidate for the professorship of



history in any Western college where there was a chance



to get at students, and as a result received two calls--one



to a Southern university, which I could not accept on



account of my anti-slavery opinions; the other to the



University of Michigan, which I accepted.  My old college friends



were kind enough to tender me later the professorship in



the new School of Art at Yale, but my belief was firm in



the value of historical studies.  The words of Wayland



rang in my ears, and I went gladly into the new field.







On arriving at the University of Michigan in October,



1857, although I had much to do with other students, I took



especial charge of the sophomore class.  It included many



young men of ability and force, but had the reputation of



being the most unmanageable body which had been known



there in years.  Thus far it had been under the charge of



tutors, and it had made life a burden to them.  Its preparation



for the work I sought to do was wretchedly imperfect. 



Among my duties was the examination of entrance



classes in modern geography as a preliminary to their



admission to my course in history, and I soon discovered a



serious weakness in the public-school system.  In her



preparatory schools the State of Michigan took especial



pride, but certainly at that time they were far below



their reputation.  If any subject was supposed to be



thoroughly taught in them it was geography, but I soon



found that in the great majority of my students there was



not a trace of real knowledge of physical geography and



very little of political.  With this state of things I at once



grappled, and immediately ``conditioned'' in these studies



about nine tenths of the entering class.  At first there were



many protests; but I said to my ingenuous youths that no



pedantic study was needed, that all I required was a preparation



such as would enable any one of them to read intelligently



his morning newspaper, and to this end I advised



each one of them to accept his conditions, to abjure all



learning by rote from text-books, to take up simply any



convenient atlas which came to hand, studying first the



map of our own country, with its main divisions, physical



and political, its water communications, trend of coasts,



spurring of mountains, positions of leading cities, etc., and



then to do the same thing with each of the leading countries



of Europe, and finally with the other main divisions



of the world.  To stimulate their interest and show them



what was meant, I gave a short course of lectures on



physical geography, showing some of its more striking



effects on history; then another course on political



geography, with a similar purpose; and finally notified my



young men that they were admitted to my classes in history



only under condition that, six weeks later, they should



pass an examination in geography, full, satisfactory, and



final.  The young fellows now took their conditions very



kindly, for they clearly saw the justice of them.  One



young man said to me:  ``Professor, you are entirely right



in conditioning me, but I was never so surprised in my



life; if there was anything which I supposed I knew well



it was geography; why, I have taught it, and very successfully,



in a large public school.''  On my asking him how he



taught a subject in which he was so deficient, he answered



that he had taught his pupils to ``sing'' it.  I replied that if



he would sing the answers to my questions, I would admit



him at once; but this he declined, saying that he much



preferred to accept the conditions.  In about six weeks I held



the final examinations, and their success amazed us all. 



Not a man failed, and some really distinguished themselves. 



They had all gone at the work cordially and heartily,



arranging themselves in squads and clubs for mutual



study and examination on each physical and political map;



and it is certain that by this simple, common-sense method



they learned more in six weeks than they had previously



learned in years of plodding along by rote, day after day



through text-books.







Nor was this mere ``cram.''  Their geographical



knowledge lasted and was increased, as was proved at my



historical examinations afterward.







I soon became intensely interested in my work, and



looked forward to it every day with pleasure.  The first



part of it was instruction in modern history as a basis for



my lectures which were to follow, and for this purpose I



used with the sophomores two text-books.  The first of



these was Robertson's ``Philosophical View of the Middle



Ages,'' which forms the introduction to his ``Life of



Charles the Fifth.''  Although superseded in many of



its parts by modern investigation, very defective in



several important matters, and in some things--as, for



example, in its appreciation of medieval literature--entirely



mistaken, it was, when written one hundred years ago,



recognized as a classic, and it remains so to this day.  It



was a work of genius.  Supplemented by elucidations and



extensions, it served an admirable purpose in introducing



my students to the things really worth knowing in modern



history, without confusing them with masses of pedantic



detail.







The next text-book which I took up was Dr. John Lord's



``Modern History,'' the same which President Woolsey



had used with my class during its senior year at Yale.  It



was imperfect in every respect, with no end of gaps and



errors, but it had one real merit--it interested its readers. 



It was, as every such work ought to be, largely biographic. 



There was enthusiasm, a sort of ``go,'' in Dr. Lord, and



this quality he had communicated to his book, so that, with



all its faults, it formed the best basis then obtainable for



further instruction.  Its omissions and errors I sought to



rectify--as Woolsey, I am sorry to say, had never done to



any extent--by offhand talks and by pointing out supplementary



reading, such as sundry chapters of Gibbon and



Hallam, essays by Macaulay, extracts from Lingard,



Ranke, Prescott, Motley, and others.  Once a fortnight



through the winter, the class assembled at my house



socially, ``the more attractive young women of the little city



being invited to meet them; but the social part was always



preceded by an hour and a half's reading of short passages



from eminent historians or travelers, bearing on our classroom



work during the previous fortnight.  These passages



were read by students whom I selected for the



purpose, and they proved useful from the historical,



literary, and social point of view.







For the class next above, the juniors, I took for textbook



preparation Guizot's ``History of Civilization in



Europe''--a book tinged with the doctrinairism of its



author, but a work of genius; a GREAT work, stimulating



new trains of thought, and opening new vistas of



knowledge.  This, with sundry supplementary talks, and with



short readings from Gibbon, Thierry, Guizot's ``History



of Civilization in France,'' and Sir James Stephen's



``Lectures on French History,'' served an excellent purpose.







Nor was the use of Guizot's book entirely confined to



historical purposes.  Calling attention to the Abb<e'>



Bautain's little book on extemporaneous speaking, as the best



treatise on the subject I had ever seen, I reminded my



students that these famous lectures of Guizot, which had



opened a new epoch in modern historical investigation and



instruction, were given, as regards phrasing, extemporaneously,



but that, as regards matter, they were carefully



prepared beforehand, having what Bautain calls a ``self-



developing order''; and I stated that I would allow any



member of my class who might volunteer for the purpose



to give, in his own phrasing, the substance of an entire



lecture.  For a young man thus to stand up and virtually



deliver one of Guizot's lectures required great concentration



of thought and considerable facility in expression, but



several students availed themselves of the permission, and



acquitted themselves admirably.  This seemed to me an



excellent training for effective public speaking, and



several of my old students, who have since distinguished



themselves in public life, have confessed to me that they



found it so.







My next and highest duty was giving lectures to the



senior class and students from the law school.  Into this



I threw myself heartily, and soon had the satisfaction of



seeing my large lecture-room constantly full.  The first



of these courses was on the ``Development of Civilization



during the Middle Ages''; and, as I followed the logical



rather than the chronological order,--taking up the subject,



not by a recital of events, but by a discussion of



epochs and subjects,--I thought it best to lecture without



manuscript or even notes.  This was, for me, a bold



venture.  I had never before attempted anything in the way



of extended extemporaneous speaking; and, as I entered



the old chapel of the university for my first lecture, and



saw it full of students of all classes, I avowed my trepidation



to President Tappan, who, having come to introduce



me, was seated by my side.  He was an admirable



extemporaneous speaker in the best sense, and he then and there



gave me a bit of advice which proved of real value.  He



said:  ``Let me, as an old hand, tell you one thing: never



stop dead; keep saying something.''  This course of lectures



was followed by others on modern history, one of



these being on ``German History from the Revival of



Learning and the Reformation to Modern Times,''



another on ``French History from the Consolidation of the



Monarchy to the French Revolution,'' and still another on



the ``French Revolution.''  To this latter course I gave



special attention, the foundation having been laid for it



in France, where I had visited various interesting places



and talked with interesting men who recalled events and



people of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic periods.  For



a text-book foundation I read with my lower classes



Mignet's ``History of the Revolution,'' which still



remained what Carlyle pronounced it--the best short summary



of that great period.







To further the work of my students in the lecture-room,



I published an interleaved syllabus of each course, and



was, I think, the first person in our country who ever did



this in connection with historical lectures.  It is a matter



of wonder to me that so few professors in these days resort



to this simple means of strengthening their instruction. 



It ought to be required by university statutes.  It seems



to me indispensable to anything like thorough work.  A



syllabus, properly interleaved, furnishes to a student by



far the best means of taking notes on each lecture, as well



as of reviewing the whole course afterward, and to a professor



the best means of testing the faithfulness of his



students.  As regards myself personally, there came to



me from my syllabus an especial advantage; for, as I have



shown in my political experiences, it gained for me the



friendship of Charles Sumner.







I have stated elsewhere that my zeal in teaching history



was by no means the result of a mere liking for that field



of thought.  Great as was my love for historical studies,



there was something I prized far more--and that was the



opportunity to promote a better training in thought



regarding our great national problems then rapidly



approaching solution, the greatest of all being the question



between the supporters and opponents of slavery.







In order that my work might be fairly well based, I had,



during my college days and my first stay abroad, begun



collecting the private library which has added certainly



to the pleasures, and probably to the usefulness, of my



life.  Books which are now costly rarities could then be



bought in the European capitals for petty sums.  There



is hardly any old European city which has not been, at



some time, one of my happy hunting-grounds in the chase



for rare books bearing upon history; even now, when



my collection, of which the greater part has been trans-



ferred to Cornell University, numbers not far short of



forty thousand volumes, the old passion still flames up at



times; and during the inditing of this chapter I have



secured two series of manuscripts of very great value in



illustrating the evolution of modern civilization.  My reason



for securing such original material was not the desire



to possess rarities and curiosities.  I found that passages



actually read from important originals during my lectures



gave a reality and vividness to my instruction which were



otherwise unattainable.  A citation of the ipsissima verba



of Erasmus, or Luther, or Melanchthon, or Peter Canisius,



or Louis XIV, or Robespierre, or Marat, interested my



students far more than any quotation at second hand could



do.  No rhetoric could impress on a class the real spirit



and strength of the middle ages as could one of my



illuminated psalters or missals; no declamation upon the



boldness of Luther could impress thinking young men as



did citations from his ``Erfurt Sermon,'' which, by weakening



his safe-conduct, put him virtually at the mercy of



his enemies at the Diet of Worms; no statements as to the



fatuity of Robespierre could equal citations from an original



copy of his ``Report on the Moral and Religious



Considerations which Ought to Govern the Republic''; all



specifications of the folly of Marat paled before the



ravings in the original copies of his newspaper, ``L'Ami



du Peuple''; no statistics regarding the paper-money



craze in France could so impress its actuality on students



as did the seeing and handling of French revolutionary



assignats and mandats, many of them with registration



numbers clearly showing the enormous quantities of this



currency then issued; no illustration, at second hand,



of the methods of the French generals during the



Revolutionary period could produce the impression given



by a simple exhibition of the broadsides issued by the



proconsuls of that period; no description of the collapse



of the triumvirate and the Reign of Terror could



equal a half-hour's reading from the ``Moniteur'';



and all accounts of the Empire were dim compared



to grandiose statements read from the original bulletins



of Napoleon.







In this way alone can history be made real to students. 



Both at my lectures and in the social gatherings at my



house, I laid out for my classes the most important originals



bearing upon their current work; and it was no small



pleasure to point out the relations of these to the events



which had formed the subject of our studies together.  I



say ``our studies together,'' because no one of my students



studied more hours than myself.  They stimulated me



greatly.  Most of them were very near my own age; several



were older.  As a rule, they were bright, inquiring,



zealous, and among them were some of the best minds I



have ever known.  From among them have since come



senators, members of Congress, judges, professors,



lawyers, heads of great business enterprises, and foreign



ministers.  One of them became my successor in the



professorship in the University of Michigan and the



presidency of Cornell, and, in one field, the leading American



historian of his time.  Another became my predecessor in



the embassy to Germany.  Though I had what might be



fairly called ``a good start'' of these men, it was necessary



to work hard to maintain my position; but such labor was



then pleasure.







Nor was my work confined to historical teaching.  After



the fashion of that time, I was called upon to hear the



essays and discussions of certain divisions of the upper



classes.  This demanded two evenings a week through two



terms in each year, and on these evenings I joyfully went



to my lecture-room, not infrequently through drifts of



snow, and, having myself kindled the fire and lighted the



lamps, awaited the discussion.  This subsidiary work,



which in these degenerate days is done by janitors, is



mentioned here as showing the simplicity of a bygone



period.  The discussions thus held were of a higher range



than any I had known at Yale, and some were decidedly



original.  One deserves especial mention.  A controversy



having arisen in Massachusetts and spread throughout the



country regarding the erection of a statue of Daniel Webster





in front of the State House at Boston, and bitter opposition



having been aroused by his seventh-of-March



speech, two groups of my student-disputants agreed to



take up this subject and model their speeches upon those



of Demosthenes and Aeschines on the crown, which they



were then reading in the original.  It was a happy thought,



and well carried out.















CHAPTER XVI







UNIVERSITY LIFE IN THE WEST--1857-1864











It must be confessed that all was not plain sailing



in my new position.  One difficulty arose from my



very youthful, not to say boyish, appearance.  I was,



indeed, the youngest member of the faculty; but at



twenty-four years one has the right to be taken for a



man, and it was vexatious to be taken for a youth of



seventeen.  At my first arrival in the university town



I noticed, as the train drew up to the station, a number



of students, evidently awaiting the coming of such



freshmen as might be eligible to the various fraternities;



and, on landing, I was at once approached by a sophomore,



who asked if I was about to enter the university.  For an



instant I was grievously abashed, but pulling myself



together, answered in a sort of affirmative way; and at this



he became exceedingly courteous, taking pains to pilot me



to a hotel, giving me much excellent advice, and even



insisting on carrying a considerable amount of my baggage. 



Other members of fraternities joined us, all most courteous



and kind, and the d<e'>nouement came only at the



registration of my name in the hotel book, when they



recognized in me ``the new professor.''  I must say to



their credit that, although they were for a time laughed



at throughout the university, they remained my warm



personal friends.







But after I had discharged the duties of my professorship



for a considerable period, this same difficulty existed. 



On a shooting excursion, an old friend and myself came,



and, being very hungry, asked for bread and milk.  My



companion being delayed outside, cleaning the guns, the



farmer's wife left me and went out to talk with him.  I



continued eating my bread and milk voraciously, and



shortly afterward they entered, he laughing heartily and



she looking rather shamefaced.  On my asking the cause



he declined for a time to state it, but at length said that



she had come out to warn him that if he did not come in



pretty soon ``that boy would eat up all the bread and milk



in the house.''  This story leaked out, and even appeared



in a local paper, but never, I think, did me any harm.







Another occurrence, shortly afterward, seemed likely



for a time to be more serious.  The sophomore class,



exuberant and inventive as ever, were evidently determined



to ``try it on'' their young professor--in fact, to treat me



as they had treated their tutors.  Any mistake made by a



student at a quiz elicited from sundry benches expressions



of regret much too plaintive, or ejaculations of contempt



much too explosive; and from these and various similar



demonstrations which grew every day among a certain set



in my class-room, it was easy to see that a trial of strength



must soon come, and it seemed to me best to force the



fighting.  Looking over these obstreperous youths I noticed



one tall, black-bearded man with a keen twinkle in his eye,



who was evidently the leader.  There was nothing in him



especially demonstrative.  He would occasionally nod in



this direction, or wink in that, or smile in the other; but



he was solemn when others were hilarious, unconcerned



when others applauded.  It was soon clear to me that in



him lay the key to the situation, and one day, at the close



of the examination, I asked him to remain.  When we were



alone I said to him, in an easy-going way, ``So, F----, I



see that either you or I must leave the university.''  He



at once bristled up, feigned indignation, and said that he



could not understand me.  This I pooh-poohed, saying that



we understood each other perfectly; that I had been only



recently a student myself; that, if the growing trouble in



the class continued, either he or I must give it up, and



added, ``I believe the trustees will prefer your departure to



mine.''  At this he protested that he had made no



demonstrations, to which I answered that if I put him on his



honor he would not deny that he was the real center of



the difficulty; that the others were, comparatively, men of



small account; and that, with him gone, the backbone of



the whole difficulty would be broken.  He seemed



impressed by this view--possibly he was not wholly



displeased at the importance it gave him; and finally he



acknowledged that perhaps he had been rather foolish, and



suggested that we try to live together a little longer.  I



answered cordially, we shook hands at parting, and there



was never any trouble afterward.  I soon found what sort



of questions interested him most, took especial pains to



adapt points in my lectures to his needs, and soon had no



stronger friend in the university.







But his activity finally found a less fortunate outcome. 



A year or two afterward came news of a terrible affair in



the university town.  A student was lying dead at the



coroner's rooms, and on inquiry it was found that his



death was the result of a carousal in which my friend F----



was a leading spirit.  Eight men were concerned, of



whom four were expelled--F---- being one--and four suspended. 



On leaving, he came to me and thanked me most



heartily for what I had done for him, said that the action



of the faculty was perfectly just, that no other course was



open to us, but that he hoped yet to show us all that he



could make a man of himself.  He succeeded.  Five years



later he fell as a general at the head of his brigade at



Gettysburg.







In addition to my regular work at the university, I



lectured frequently in various cities throughout Michigan



and the neighboring States.  It was the culminating period



of the popular-lecture system, and through the winter



months my Friday and Saturday evenings were generally



given to this sort of duty.  It was, after its fashion, what



in these days is called ``university extension''; indeed, the



main purpose of those members of the faculty thus



invited to lecture was to spread the influence of the



university.  But I received from the system more than I gave to



it; for it gave me not only many valuable acquaintances



throughout the West, but it brought to Ann Arbor the best



men then in the field, among them such as Emerson, Curtis,



Whipple, Wendell Phillips, Carl Schurz, Moncure



Conway, Bayard Taylor, and others noted then, but, alas,



how few of them remembered now!  To have them by my



fireside and at my table was one of the greatest pleasures



of a professorial life.  It was at the beginning of my



housekeeping; and under my roof on the university



grounds we felt it a privilege to welcome these wise men



from the East, and to bring the faculty and students into



closer relations with them.







As regards the popular-lecture pulpit, my main wish



was to set people thinking on various subjects, and



especially regarding slavery and ``protection.''  This



presently brought a storm upon me.  Some years before there



had settled in the university town a thin, vociferous lawyer,



past his prime, but not without ideas and force.  He



had for many years been a department subordinate at



Washington; but, having accumulated some money, he had



donned what was then known as senatorial costume--



namely, a blue swallow-tailed coat, and a buff vest, with



brass buttons--and coming to this little Michigan town



he had established a Whig paper, which afterward became



Republican.  He was generally credited, no doubt justly,



with a determination to push himself into the United



States Senate; but this determination was so obvious that



people made light of it, and he never received the honor



of a nomination to that or any other position.  The main



burden of his editorials was the greatness of Henry Clay,



and the beauties of a protective tariff, his material being



largely drawn from a book he had published some years



before; and, on account of the usual form of his arguments,



he was generally referred to, in the offhand Western



way, as ``Old Statistics.''







In a public lecture based upon my Russian experiences,



I had incidentally attacked paternal government, and



especially such developments of it as tariffs for protection. 



The immediate result was a broadside from this



gentleman's paper, and this I answered in an article which



was extensively copied throughout the State.  At this he



evidently determined to crush this intruder upon his



domain.  That an ``upstart''--a ``mere school-teacher''--



should presume to reply to a man like himself, who had



sat at the feet of Henry Clay, and was old enough to be



my father, was monstrous presumption; but that a professor



in the State university of a commonwealth largely



Republican should avow free-trade opinions was akin to



treason, and through twelve successive issues of his



paper he lashed me in all the moods and tenses.  As these



attacks soon became scurrilous, I made no reply to any



after the first; but his wrath was increased when he saw



my reply quoted by the press throughout the State and his



own diatribes neglected.  Among his more serious charges



I remember but one, and this was that I had evidently



come into the State as a secret emissary of Van Burenism. 



But I recalled the remark of my enemy's idol, Henry



Clay, to the effect that no one should ever reply to an



attack by an editor, a priest, or a woman, since each of



them is sure to have the last word.  This feeling was soon



succeeded by indifference; for my lecture-rooms, both at



the university and throughout the State, were more and



more frequented, and it became clear that my opponent's



attacks simply advertised me.  The following year I had



my revenge.  From time to time debates on current topics



were held at the city hall, the participants being generally



young professional men; but, the subject of a tariff for



protection having been announced, my old enemy declared,



several weeks beforehand, his intention of taking part in



the discussion.  Among my students that winter was one



of the most gifted young scholars and speakers I have



ever known.  Not long after his graduation he was sent



to the United States Senate from one of the more important



Western States, and nothing but his early death



prevented his attaining a national reputation.  He was a man



of convictions, strong and skilful in impressing them upon



his hearers, of fine personal appearance, with a pleasing



voice, and in every way fitted to captivate an audience. 



Him I selected as the David who was to punish the



protectionist Goliath.  He had been himself a protectionist,



having read Greeley's arguments in the ``New York



Tribune,'' but he had become a convert to my views, and



day after day and week after week I kept him in training



on the best expositions of free trade, and, above all, on



Bastiat's ``Sophisms of Protection.''  On the appointed



evening the city hall was crowded, and my young David



having modestly taken a back seat, the great Goliath



appeared at the front in full senatorial costume, furbished



up for the occasion, with an enormous collection of books



and documents; and, the subject being announced, he arose,



assumed his most imposing senatorial attitude, and began



a dry, statistical oration.  His manner was harsh, his



matter wearisome; but he plodded on through an hour



--and then my David arose.  He was at his best.  In



five minutes he had the audience fully with him.  Every



point told.  From time to time the house shook with



applause; and at the close of the debate, a vote of the meeting



being taken after the usual fashion in such assemblies, my



old enemy was left in a ridiculous minority.  Not only



free-traders, but even protectionists voted against him. 



As he took himself very seriously, he was intensely



mortified, and all the more so when he learned from one of my



students that I now considered that we were ``even.''[4]











[4] The causes of my change of views on the question of



``protection'' are given in my political reminiscences.











The more I threw myself into the work of the university



the more I came to believe in the ideas on which it was



founded, and to see that it was a reality embodying many



things of which I had previously only dreamed.  Up to



that time the highest institutions of learning in the United



States were almost entirely under sectarian control.  Even



the University of Virginia, which Thomas Jefferson had



founded as a center of liberal thought, had fallen under



the direction of sectarians, and among the great majority



of the Northern colleges an unwritten law seemed to



require that a university president should be a clergyman. 



The instruction in the best of these institutions was, as I



have shown elsewhere, narrow, their methods outworn,



and the students, as a rule, confined to one simple, single,



cast-iron course, in which the great majority of them took



no interest.  The University of Michigan had made a



beginning of something better.  The president was Dr.



Henry Philip Tappan, formerly a Presbyterian clergyman,



a writer of repute on philosophical subjects, a strong



thinker, an impressive orator, and a born leader of men,



who, during a visit to Europe, had been greatly impressed



by the large and liberal system of the German universities,



and had devoted himself to urging a similar system



in our own country.  On the Eastern institutions--save,



possibly, Brown--he made no impression.  Each of them



was as stagnant as a Spanish convent, and as self-satisfied



as a Bourbon duchy; but in the West he attracted



supporters, and soon his ideas began to show themselves



effective in the State university over which he had been



called to preside.







The men he summoned about him were, in the main,



admirably fitted to aid him.  Dearest of all to me, though



several years my senior, was Henry Simmons Frieze,



professor of Latin.  I had first met him at the University of



Berlin, had then traveled with him through Germany and



Italy, and had found him one of the most charming men



I had ever met--simple, modest, retiring to a fault, yet a



delightful companion and a most inspiring teacher.  There



was in him a combination which at first seemed singular;



but experience has since shown me that it is by no means



unnatural, for he was not only an ideal professor of Latin,



but a gifted musician.  The first revelation of this latter



quality was made to me in a manner which showed his



modesty.  One evening during our student days at Berlin,



at a reception given by the American minister of that



period,--Governor Vroom of New Jersey,--I heard the



sound of music coming from one of the more distant



apartments.  It was a sonata of Beethoven, wonderfully



interpreted, showing not only skill but deep feeling.  On



my asking my neighbors who the performer might be,



no one seemed to know, until, at last, some one suggested



that it might be Professor Frieze.  I made my way through



the crowd toward the room from which the sounds came,



but before arriving there the music had ended; and when I



met the professor shortly afterward, and asked him if he



had been the musician, his reply was so modest and evasive



that I thought the whole thing a mistake and said nothing



more about it.  On our way to Italy some months



later, I observed that, as we were passing through Bohemia,



he jotted down in his note-book the quaint songs of the



peasants and soldiers, and a few weeks later still he gave an



exhibition of his genius.  Sitting down one evening at the



piano on the little coasting steamer between Genoa and



Civit<a!> Vecchia, he began playing, and though it has



been my good fortune to hear all the leading pianists



of my time, I have never heard one who seemed to interpret



the masterpieces of music more worthily.  At Ann Arbor



I now came to know him intimately.  Once or twice a



week he came to my house, and, as mine was the only grand



piano in the town, he enjoyed playing upon it.  His



extemporizations were flights of genius.  At these gatherings



he was inspired by two other admirable musicians, one



being my dear wife, and the other Professor Brunnow, the



astronomer.  Nothing could be more delightful than their



interpretations together of the main works of Beethoven



Handel, Mozart, Haydn, Weber, and other masters.  On



one of these evenings, when I happened to speak of the



impression made upon me at my first hearing of a choral



in a German church, Frieze began playing Luther's hymn,



``Ein' feste Burg ist unser Gott,'' throwing it into all



forms and keys, until we listened to his improvisations



in a sort of daze which continued until nearly midnight. 



Next day, at St. Andrew's Church, he, as usual, had charge



of the organ.  Into his opening voluntary he wove the



music of the preceding evening, the ``Feste Burg''; it



ran through all the chants of the morning service; it



pervaded the accompaniment to the hymns; it formed the



undertone of all the interludes; it was not relinquished



until the close of the postlude.  And the same was true of



the afternoon service.  I have always insisted that, had he



lived in Germany, he would have been a second Beethoven. 



This will seem a grossly exaggerated tribute, but I do not



hesitate to maintain it.  So passionately was he devoted



to music that at times he sent his piano away from his



house in order to shun temptation to abridge his professorial



work, and especially was this the case when he was



preparing his edition of Vergil.  A more lovely spirit



never abode in mortal frame.  No man was ever more



generally beloved in a community; none, more lamented at



his death.  The splendid organ erected as a memorial to



him in the great auditorium of the university; the noble



monument which his students have placed over his grave;



his portrait, which hangs in one of the principal rooms;



the society which commemorates his name--all combine



to show how deeply he was respected and beloved.







Entwined also with my happiest recollections is Brunnow,



professor of astronomy and director of the observatory. 



His eminence in his department was widely recognized,



as was shown when he was afterward made



director of the Dudley Observatory at Albany, N. Y., and,



finally, astronomer royal of Ireland.  His musical abilities,



in connection with those of Frieze, aided to give a delightful



side to this period of my life.  There was in him a quiet



simplicity which led those who knew him best to love him



most, but it occasionally provoked much fun among the



students.  On one occasion, President Tappan, being



suddenly called out of town, requested Brunnow, who had



married his daughter and was an inmate of his family, to



find some member of the faculty to take his place at



morning prayers next day.  Thereupon Brunnow visited sev-



eral professors, his first question to each of them being,



with his German use of the consonants, ``Professor, can



you BRAY?'' and henceforward this was added to the many



standing jokes upon him in the student world.







I also found at the university other admirable men, and



among those to whom I became specially attached was



Thomas M. Cooley.  When he had become chief justice



of the State, and the most eminent writer of his time on the



Constitution of the United States, he was still the same



man, gentle, simple, and kindly.  Besides these were



such well-known professors as Fasquelle in modern



literature; Williams, Douglass, and Winchell in science;



Boise in Greek; Palmer, Sager, and Gunn in medicine



and surgery; Campbell and Walker in law.  Of these



Judge Campbell was to me one of the main attractions



of the place--a profound lawyer, yet with a kindly humor



which lighted up all about him.  He was especially interested



in the early French history of the State, to which he



had been drawn by his study of the titles to landed property



in Detroit and its neighborhood, and some of his discoveries



were curious.  One of these had reference to an



island in the straits near Detroit known as ``Skillagalee,''



which had puzzled him a long time.  The name seemed to be



Irish, and the question was how an Irish name could have



been thus applied.  Finally he found on an old map an earlier



name.  It was <I^>le aus Galets, or Pebble Island, which, in



the mouths of Yankee sailors, had taken this apparently



Celtic form.  Another case was that of a river in Canada



emptying into the straits not far from Detroit.  It was



known as ``Yellow Dog River''; but, on rummaging



through the older maps, he discovered that the earlier



name was River St. John.  To account for the transformation



was at first difficult, but the mystery was finally



unraveled: the Rivi<e!>re St. Jean became, in the Canadian



patois, Rivi<e!>re Saan Jawne, and gradually Rivi<e!>re Chien



Jaune; recent geographers had simply translated it into



English.







The features which mainly distinguished the University



of Michigan from the leading institutions of the East



were that it was utterly unsectarian, that various courses



of instruction were established, and that options were



allowed between them.  On these accounts that university



holds a most important place in the history of American



higher education; for it stands practically at the beginning



of the transition from the old sectarian college to the



modern university, and from the simple, single, cast-iron



course to the form which we now know, in which various



courses are presented, with free choice between them.  The



number of students was about five hundred, and the faculty



corresponded to these in numbers.  Now that the



university includes over four thousand students, with a



faculty in proportion, those seem the days of small



things; but to me at that period it was all very grand.  It



seemed marvelous that there were then very nearly as



many students at the University of Michigan as at Yale;



and, as a rule, they were students worth teaching--hardy,



vigorous, shrewd, broad, with faith in the greatness of



the country and enthusiasm regarding the nation's future. 



It may be granted that there was, in many of them, a



lack of elegance, but there was neither languor nor



cynicism.  One seemed, among them, to breathe a purer,



stronger air.  Over the whole institution Dr. Tappan



presided, and his influence, both upon faculty and students,



was, in the main, excellent.  He sympathized heartily with



the work of every professor, allowed to each great liberty,



yet conducted the whole toward the one great end of



developing a university more and more worthy of our



country.  His main qualities were of the best.  Nothing



could be better than his discussions of great questions of



public policy and of education.  One of the noblest



orations I have ever heard was an offhand speech of his on



receiving for the university museum a cast of the Laoco<o:>n



from the senior class; yet this speech was made without



preparation, and in the midst of engrossing labor.  He



often showed, not only the higher qualities required in a



position like his, but a remarkable shrewdness and tact in



dealing with lesser questions.  Typical was one example,



which taught me much when, in after years, I was called



to similar duties at Cornell.  The present tower and chime



of the University of Michigan did not then exist; between



the two main buildings on the university grounds there



was simply a wooden column, bearing a bell of moderate



size, which was rung at every lecture-hour by the principal



janitor.  One cold winter night those of us living in the



immediate neighborhood heard the sound of axe-strokes. 



Presently there came a crash, and all was still.  Next



morning, at the hour for chapel, no bell was rung; it



was found that the column had been cut down and the bell



carried off.  A president of less shrewdness would have



declaimed to the students on the enormity of such a



procedure, and have accentuated his eloquence with threats. 



Not so Dr. Tappan.  At the close of the morning prayers



he addressed the students humorously.  There was a great



attendance, for all wished to know how he would deal



with the affair.  Nothing could be better than his matter



and manner.  He spoke somewhat on this wise:  ``Gentlemen,



there has doubtless been a mistake in the theory of



some of you regarding the college bell.  It would seem



that some have believed that if the bell were destroyed,



time would cease, and university exercises would be



suspended.  But, my friends, time goes on as ever, without



the bell as with it; lectures and exercises of every sort



continue, of course, as usual.  The only thing which has



occurred is that some of you have thought it best to



dispense with the aid in keeping time which the regents of



the university have so kindly given you.  Knowing that



large numbers of you were not yet provided with watches,



the regents very thoughtfully provided the bell, and a man



to ring it for you at the proper hours; and they will doubtless



be pleased to learn that you at last feel able to dispense



with it, and save them the expense of maintaining



it.  You are trying an interesting experiment.  In most



of the leading European universities, students get along



perfectly without a bell; why should we not?  In the interests 



of the finances of the university, I am glad to see



you trying this experiment, and will only suggest that it



be tried thoroughly.  Of course the rolls will be called in the



lecture-rooms promptly, as usual, and you will, of course,



be present.  If the experiment succeeds, it will enable us



to dispense with a university bell forever; but if, after a



suitable time, you decide that it is better to have the bell



back again to remind you of the hours, and if you will make



a proper request to the regents through me, I trust that



they will allow you to restore it to its former position.''







The students were greatly amused to see the matter



taken in this way.  They laughingly acknowledged themselves



outwitted, and greeted the doctor's speech with applause. 



All of the faculty entered into the spirit of the



matter; rolls were called perhaps rather more promptly



than formerly, and students not present were marked



rather more mercilessly than of old.  There was evidently



much reluctance on their part to ask for excuses, in view



of the fact that they had themselves abolished the bell



which had enabled them to keep the time; and one morning,



about a month or six weeks later, after chapel, a big



jolly student rose and asked permission to make a motion. 



This motion was that the president of the university be



requested to allow the students to restore the bell to its



former position.  The proposal was graciously received by



the doctor, put by him after the usual parliamentary manner,



carried unanimously, and, a few mornings later, the



bell was found in its old place on a new column, was rung



as usual, and matters went on after the old fashion.







Every winter Dr. Tappan went before the legislature



to plead the cause of the university, and to ask for



appropriations.  He was always heard with pleasure, since he



was an excellent speaker; but certain things militated



against him.  First of all, he had much to say of the



excellent models furnished by the great German universities,



and especially by those of Prussia.  This gave demagogues



in the legislature, anxious to make a reputation in



buncombe, a great chance.  They orated to the effect that



we wanted an American and not a Prussian system.  Moreover,



some unfortunate legends were developed.  Mrs.



Tappan, a noble and lovely woman belonging to the



Livingston family, had been brought up in New York and



New England, and could hardly suppress her natural



preference for her old home and friends.  A story grew



that in an assembly of Michigan ladies she once remarked



that the doctor and herself considered themselves as



``missionaries to the West.''  This legend spread far and



wide.  It was resented, and undoubtedly cost the doctor dear.







The worst difficulty by far which he had to meet was the



steady opposition of the small sectarian colleges scattered



throughout the State.  Each, in its own petty interest,



dreaded the growth of any institution better than itself;



each stirred the members of the legislature from its locality



to oppose all aid to the State university; each, in its



religious assemblages, its synods, conferences, and the



like, sought to stir prejudice against the State institution



as ``godless.''  The result was that the doctor, in spite of



his eloquent speeches, became the butt of various wretched



demagogues in the legislature, and he very rarely secured



anything in the way of effective appropriations.  The



university had been founded by a grant of public lands from



the United States to Michigan; and one of his arguments



was based on the fact that an immensely valuable tract, on



which a considerable part of the city of Toledo now stands,



had been taken away from the university without any



suitable remuneration.  But even this availed little, and



it became quite a pastime among demagogues at the



State Capitol to bait the doctor.  On one of these occasions



he was inspired to make a prophecy.  Disgusted at the



poor, cheap blackguardism, he shook the dust of the legislature



off his feet, and said:  ``The day will come when my



students will take your places, and then something will be



done.''  That prophecy was fulfilled.  In a decade the



leading men in the legislature began to be the graduates



of the State university; and now these graduates are



largely in control, and they have dealt nobly with their



alma mater.  The State has justly become proud of it, and



has wisely developed it.







Dr. Tappan's work was great, indeed.  He stood not



only at the beginning of the institution at Ann Arbor, but



really at the beginning of the other universities of the



Western States, from which the country is gaining so



much at present, and is sure to gain vastly more in the



future.  The day will come when his statue will commemorate



his services.







But there was another feature in his administration to



which I refer with extreme reluctance.  He had certain



``defects of his qualities.''  Big, hearty, frank, and



generous, he easily became the prey of those who wrought



upon his feelings; and, in an evil hour, he was drawn into



a quarrel not his own, between two scientific professors. 



This quarrel became exceedingly virulent; at times it



almost paralyzed the university, and finally it convulsed the



State.  It became the main object of the doctor's thoughts. 



The men who had drawn him into it quietly retired under



cover, and left him to fight their battle in the open.  He



did this powerfully, but his victories were no less calamitous



than his defeats; for one of the professors, when



overcome, fell back upon the church to which he belonged,



and its conference was led to pass resolutions warning



Christian people against the university.  The forces of



those hostile to the institution were marshaled to the sound



of the sectarian drum.  The quarrel at last became political;



and when the doctor unwisely entered the political



field in hopes of defeating the candidates put forward by



his opponents, he was beaten at the polls, and his resignation



followed.  A small number of us, including Judge



Cooley and Professors Frieze, Fasquelle, Boise, and myself,



simply maintained an ``armed neutrality,'' standing



by the university, and refusing to be drawn into this



whirlpool of intrigue and objurgation.  Personally, we



loved the doctor.  Every one of us besought him to give up



the quarrel, but in vain.  He would not; he could not.  It



went on till the crash came.  He was virtually driven from



the State, retired to Europe, and never returned.







Years afterward, the citizens of Michigan in all parts of



the State sought to make amends to him.  The great body



of the graduates, who loved and respected him, with leading



men throughout the commonwealth, joined in a letter



inviting him to return as a public guest; but he declined,



and never again saw his native land.  His first main place



of residence was Basel, where, at the university, he



superintended the education of his grandson, who, at a later



period, became a professor at Heidelberg.  Finally, he



retired to a beautiful villa on the shores of Lake Leman



and there, with his family about him, peacefully followed



his chosen studies.  At his death he was buried amid the



vineyards and orchards of Vevey.







Though I absolutely refused to be drawn into any of



his quarrels, my relations with the doctor remained kindly



and not a single feeling was left which marred my visit



to him in after years at Basel, or my later pilgrimage to



his grave on the shores of Lake Leman.  To no man is any



success I may have afterward had in the administration



of Cornell University so greatly due as to him.







In this summary I have hardly touched upon the most



important part of my duty,--namely, the purpose of my



lecture-courses, with their relations to that period in the



history of our country, and to the questions which thinking



men, and especially thinking young men, were then



endeavoring to solve,--since all this has been given in my



political reminiscences.







So much for my main work at the University of Michigan. 



But I had one recreation which was not without its



uses.  The little city of Ann Arbor is a beautiful place on



the Huron River, and from the outset interested me. 



Even its origin had a peculiar charm.  About a quarter



of a century before my arrival, three families came from



the East to take up the land which they had bought



of the United States; and, as their three holdings touched



each other at one corner, they brought boughs of trees



to that spot and erected a sort of hut, or arbor, in which



to live until their log houses were finished.  On coming



together in this arbor they discovered that the



Christian name of each of the three wives was Ann:



hence the name of the place; and this fact gave a



poetic coloring to it which was a permanent pleasure to



me.  It was an unending satisfaction to reflect that no



misguided patriot had been allowed to inflict upon that



charming university town the name of ``Athens,'' or 



``Oxford,'' or ``Socratopolis,'' or ``Anacreonsburg,'' or



``Platoville,'' or ``Emporium,'' or ``Eudaimonia.''  What, but



for those three good women, the name might have been,



may be judged from the fact that one of the founders of



the university did his best to have it called a



``Katholo<e:>pistemiad''!







But there was one drawback.  The ``campus,'' on which



stood the four buildings then devoted to instruction,



greatly disappointed me.  It was a flat, square inclosure



of forty acres, unkempt and wretched.  Throughout



its whole space there were not more than a score of



trees outside the building sites allotted to professors;



unsightly plank walks connected the buildings, and in



every direction were meandering paths, which in dry weather



were dusty and in wet weather muddy.  Coming, as



I did, from the glorious elms of Yale, all this distressed



me, and one of my first questions was why no trees had



been planted.  The answer was that the soil was so hard



and dry that none would grow.  But on examining



the territory in the neighborhood, especially the little



inclosures about the pretty cottages of the town, I found



fine large trees, and among them elms.  At this, without



permission from any one, I began planting trees within the



university inclosure; established, on my own account,



several avenues; and set out elms to overshadow them. 



Choosing my trees with care, carefully protecting and



watering them during the first two years, and gradually



adding to them a considerable number of evergreens, I



preached practically the doctrine of adorning the campus. 



Gradually some of my students joined me; one class after



another aided in securing trees and in planting them,



others became interested, until, finally, the university



authorities made me ``superintendent of the grounds,''



and appropriated to my work the munificent sum of



seventy-five dollars a year.  So began the splendid growth



which now surrounds those buildings.  These trees became



to me as my own children.  Whenever I revisit Ann Arbor



my first care is to go among them, to see how they prosper,



and especially how certain peculiar examples are flourishing;



and at my recent visit, forty-six years after their



planting, I found one of the most beautiful academic



groves to be seen in any part of the world.







The most saddening thing during my connection with



the university I have touched upon in my political



reminiscences.  Three years after my arrival the Civil War



broke out, and there came a great exodus of students into



the armies, the vast majority taking up arms for the



Union, and a few for the Confederate States.  The very



noblest of them thus went forth--many of them, alas!



never to return, and among them not a few whom I loved



as brothers and even as my own children.  Of all the



experiences of my life, this was among the most saddening.







My immediate connection with the University of Michigan



as resident professor of history lasted about six years;



and then, on account partly of business interests which



resulted from the death of my father, partly of my election



to the New York State Senate, and partly of my



election to the presidency of Cornell University, I resided



in central New York, but retained a lectureship at the



Western institution.  I left the work and the friends who



had become so dear to me with the greatest reluctance, and



as long as possible I continued to revisit the old scenes,



and to give courses of lectures.  But at last my duties at



Cornell absolutely forbade this, and so ended a connection



which was to me one of the most fruitful in useful



experiences and pregnant thoughts that I have ever known.



















PART II







POLITICAL LIFE















CHAPTER III







FROM JACKSON TO FILLMORE--1832-1851







My arrival in this world took place at one of the



stormy periods of American political history.  It



was on the third of the three election days which carried



Andrew Jackson a second time into the Presidency. 



Since that period, the election, with its paralysis of



business, ghastly campaign lying, and monstrous vilification



of candidates, has been concentrated into one day; but at



that time all the evil passions of a presidential election



were allowed to ferment and gather vitriolic strength



during three days.







I was born into a politically divided family.  My



grandfather, on my mother's side, whose name I was destined



to bear, was an ardent Democrat; had, as such, represented



his district in the State legislature, and other public



bodies; took his political creed from Thomas Jefferson, and



adored Andrew Jackson.  My father, on the other hand,



was in all his antecedents and his personal convictions, a



devoted Whig, taking his creed from Alexander Hamilton,



and worshiping Henry Clay.







This opposition between my father and grandfather did



not degenerate into personal bitterness; but it was very



earnest, and, in later years, my mother told me that when



Hayne, of South Carolina, made his famous speech,



charging the North with ill-treatment of the South, my



grandfather sent a copy of it to my father, as unanswerable;



but that, shortly afterward, my father sent to my



grandfather the speech of Daniel Webster, in reply, and



that, when this was read, the family allowed that the



latter had the better of the argument.  I cannot help thinking



that my grandfather must have agreed with them, tacitly,



if not openly.  He loved the Hampshire Hills of



Massachusetts, from which he came.  Year after year he took



long journeys to visit them, and Webster's magnificent



reference to the ``Old Bay State'' must have aroused his



sympathy and pride.







Fortunately, at that election, as at so many others since,



the good sense of the nation promptly accepted the result,



and after its short carnival of political passion, dismissed



the whole subject; the minority simply leaving the responsibility



of public affairs to the majority, and all betaking



themselves again to their accustomed vocations.







I do not remember, during the first seven years of my



life, ever hearing any mention of political questions.  The



only thing I heard during that period which brings back a



chapter in American politics, was when, at the age of five



years, I attended an infant school and took part in a sort



of catechism, all the children rising and replying to the



teacher's questions.  Among these were the following:







Q.  Who is President of the United States?







A.  Martin Van Buren.







Q.  Who is governor of the State of New York?







A.  William L. Marcy.







This is to me somewhat puzzling, for I was four years



old when Martin Van Buren was elected, and my father



was his very earnest opponent, yet, though I recall easily



various things which occurred at that age and even earlier,



I have no remembrance of any general election before



1840, and my only recollection of the first New York



statesman elected to the Presidency is this mention of his



name, in a child's catechism.







My recollections of American polities begin, then, with



the famous campaign of 1840, and of that they are vivid. 



Our family had, in 1839, removed to Syracuse, which,



although now a city of about one hundred and twenty



thousand inhabitants, was then a village of fewer than six



thousand; but, as the central town of the State, it was



already a noted gathering-place for political conventions



and meetings.  The great Whig mass-meeting held there,



in 1840, was long famous as the culmination of the



campaign between General Harrison and Martin Van Buren.







As a President, Mr. Van Buren had fallen on evil times. 



It was a period of political finance; of demagogical



methods in public business; and the result was ``hard



times,'' with an intense desire throughout the nation for a



change.  This desire was represented especially by the



Whig party.  General Harrison had been taken up as its



candidate, not merely because he had proved his worth



as governor of the Northwestern Territory, and as a



senator in Congress, but especially as the hero of sundry



fights with the Indians, and, above all, of the plucky little



battle at Tippecanoe.  The most popular campaign song,



which I soon learned to sing lustily, was ``Tippecanoe and



Tyler, Too,'' and sundry lines of it expressed, not only



my own deepest political convictions and aspirations, but



also those cherished by myriads of children of far larger



growth.  They ran as follows:







     ``Oh, have you heard the great commotion-motion-motion



       Rolling the country through?



       It is the ball a-rolling on



       For Tippecanoe and Tyler, too,



       For Tippecanoe and Tyler, too;



       And with them we 'll beat little Van;



       Van, Van is a used up man;



       And with them we 'll beat little Van.''











The campaign was an apotheosis of tom-foolery. 



General Harrison had lived the life, mainly, of a Western



farmer, and for a time, doubtless, exercised amid his rude



surroundings the primitive hospitality natural to sturdy



Western pioneers.  On these facts the changes were rung. 



In every town and village a log cabin was erected where



the Whigs held their meetings; and the bringing of logs,



with singing and shouting, to build it, was a great event;



its front door must have a wooden latch on the inside;



but the latch-string must run through the door; for the



claim which the friends of General Harrison especially



insisted upon was that he not only lived in a log cabin, but



that his latch-string was always out, in token that all his



fellow-citizens were welcome at his fireside.







Another element in the campaign was hard cider. 



Every log cabin must have its barrel of this acrid fluid,



as the antithesis of the alleged beverage of President Van



Buren at the White House.  He, it was asserted, drank



champagne, and on this point I remember that a verse



was sung at log-cabin meetings which, after describing,



in a prophetic way the arrival of the ``Farmer of North



Bend'' at the White House, ran as follows:







   ``They were all very merry, and drinking champagne



     When the Farmer, impatient, knocked louder again;



     Oh, Oh, said Prince John, I very much fear



     We must quit this place the very next year.''











``Prince John'' was President Van Buren's brilliant



son; famous for his wit and eloquence, who, in after years,



rose to be attorney-general of the State of New York, and



who might have risen to far higher positions had his



principles equaled his talents.







Another feature at the log cabin, and in all political



processions, was at least one raccoon; and if not a live



raccoon in a cage, at least a raccoon skin nailed upon the



outside of the cabin.  This gave local color, but hence



came sundry jibes from the Democrats, for they were



wont to refer to the Whigs as ``coons,'' and to their log



cabins as ``coon pens.''  Against all these elements of



success, added to promises of better times, the Democratic



party could make little headway.  Martin Van Buren,



though an admirable public servant in many ways, was



discredited.  M. de Bacourt, the French Minister at



Washington, during his administration, was, it is true, very



fond of him, and this cynical scion of French nobility



wrote in a private letter, which has been published in these



latter days, ``M. Van Buren is the most perfect imitation



of a gentleman I ever saw.''  But this commendation had



not then come to light, and the main reliance of the Democrats



in capturing the popular good-will was their candidate



for the Vice-Presidency, Colonel Richard M. Johnson,



of Kentucky.  He, too, had fought in the Indian wars,



and bravely.  Therefore it was that one of the Whig songs



which especially rejoiced me, ran:







     ``They shout and sing, Oh humpsy dumpsy,



       Colonel Johnson killed Tecumseh.''











Among the features of that period which excited my



imagination were the enormous mass meetings, with



processions, coming in from all points of the compass, miles



in length, and bearing every patriotic device and political



emblem.  Here the Whigs had infinitely the advantage. 



Their campaign was positive and aggressive.  On platform-



wagons were men working at every trade which expected



to be benefited by Whig success; log cabins of all



sorts and sizes, hard-cider barrels, coon pens, great



canvas balls, which were kept ``a-rolling on,'' canoes, such



as General Harrison had used in crossing Western rivers,



eagles that screamed in defiance, and cocks that crowed



for victory.  The turning ball had reference to sundry



lines in the foremost campaign song.  For the October



election in Maine having gone Whig by a large majority,



clearly indicating what the general result was to be in



November, the opening lines ran as follows:







   ``Oh, have you heard the news from Maine--Maine--Maine?



     Rolling the country through?



     It is the ball a-rolling on



     For Tippecanoe and Tyler, too.''



                  &c., &c., &c.











Against all this the Democrats, with their negative and



defensive platform, found themselves more and more at



a disadvantage; they fought with desperation, but in vain,



and one of their most unlucky ventures to recover their



position was an effort to undermine General Harrison's



military reputation.  For this purpose they looked about,



and finally found one of their younger congressional



representatives, considered to be a rising man, who, having



gained some little experience in the Western militia, had



received the honorary title of ``General,'' Isaac M. Crary,



of Michigan; him they selected to make a speech in Congress



exhibiting and exploding General Harrison's military



record.  He was very reluctant to undertake it, but



at last yielded, and, after elaborate preparation, made an



argument loud and long, to show that General Harrison



was a military ignoramus.  The result was both comic



and pathetic.  There was then in Congress the most famous



stump-speaker of his time, and perhaps of all times,



a man of great physical, intellectual, and moral vigor;



powerful in argument, sympathetic in manner, of infinite



wit and humor, and, unfortunately for General Crary,



a Whig,--Thomas Corwin, of Ohio.  Mr. Crary's heavy,



tedious, perfunctory arraignment of General Harrison



being ended, Corwin rose and began an offhand speech



on ``The Military Services of General Isaac M. Crary.''



In a few minutes he had as his audience, not only the House



of Representatives, but as many members of the Senate,



of the Supreme Court, and visitors to the city, as could



be crowded into the congressional chamber, and, of all



humorous speeches ever delivered in Congress, this of



Corwin has come down to us as the most successful.  Long



afterward, parts of it lingered in our ``speakers' manuals''



and were declaimed in the public schools as examples



of witty oratory.  Many years later, when the



House of Representatives left the old chamber and went



into that which it now occupies, Thurlow Weed wrote



an interesting article on scenes he had witnessed in the old



hall, and most vivid of all was his picture of this speech



by Corwin.  His delineations of Crary's brilliant exploits,



his portrayal of the valiant charges made by Crary's



troops on muster days upon the watermelon patches of



Michigan, not only convulsed his audience, but were



echoed throughout the nation, Whigs and Democrats



laughing alike; and when John Quincy Adams, in a speech



shortly afterward, referred to the man who brought on



this tempest of fun as ``the late General Crary,'' there



was a feeling that the adjective indicated a fact.  It really



was so; Crary, although a man of merit, never returned



to Congress, but was thenceforth dropped from political



life.  More than twenty years afterward, as I was passing



through Western Michigan, a friend pointed out to me



his tombstone, in a little village cemetery, with comments,



half comic, half pathetic; and I also recall a mournful



feeling when one day, in going over the roll of my



students at the University of Michigan, I came upon one who



bore the baptismal name of Isaac Crary.  Evidently, the



blighted young statesman had a daughter who, in all this



storm of ridicule and contempt, stood by him, loved him,



and proudly named her son after him.







Another feature in the campaign also impressed me. 



A blackguard orator, on the Whig side, one of those



whom great audiences applaud for the moment and ever



afterward despise,--a man named Ogle,--made a speech



which depicted the luxury prevailing at the White House,



and among other evidences of it, dwelt upon the ``gold



spoons'' used at the President's table, denouncing their



use with such unction that, for the time, unthinking



people regarded Martin Van Buren as a sort of American



Vitellius.  As a matter of fact, the scanty silver-gilt table



utensils at the White House have been shown, in these



latter days, in some very pleasing articles written by



General Harrison's grandson, after this grandson had



himself retired from the Presidency, to have been, for the



most part, bought long before;--and by order of General



Washington.







The only matter of political importance which, as a boy



eight years old, I seized upon, and which dwells in my



memory, was the creation of the ``Sub-Treasury.''  That



this was a wise measure seems now proven by the fact that



through all the vicissitudes of politics, from that day to



this, it has remained and rendered admirable service.  But



at that time it was used as a weapon against the



Democratic party, and came to be considered by feather-



brained partizans, young and old, as the culmination of



human wickedness.  As to what the ``Sub-Treasury''



really was I had not the remotest idea; but this I knew;--



that it was the most wicked outrage ever committed by a



remorseless tyrant upon a long-suffering people.







In November of 1840 General Harrison was elected.  In



the following spring he was inaugurated, and the Whigs



being now for the first time in power, the rush for office



was fearful.  It was undoubtedly this crushing pressure



upon the kindly old man that caused his death.  What



British soldiers, and Indian warriors, and fire, flood, and



swamp fevers could not accomplish in over sixty years,



was achieved by the office-seeking hordes in just one



month.  He was inaugurated on the fourth of March and



died early in April.







I remember, as if it were yesterday, my dear mother



coming to my bedside, early in the morning, and saying



to me, ``President Harrison is dead.''  I wondered what



was to become of us.  He was the first President who had



died during his term of service, and a great feeling of



relief came over me when I learned that his high office



had devolved upon the Vice-President.







But now came a new trouble, and my youthful mind was



soon sadly agitated.  The Whig papers, especially the



``New York Express'' and ``Albany Evening Journal,''



began to bring depressing accounts of the new President,



--tidings of extensive changes in the offices throughout the



country, and especially in the post-offices.  At first the



Whig papers published these under the heading



``Appointments by the President.''  But soon the heading



changed; it became ``Appointments by Judas Iscariot,''



or ``Appointments by Benedict Arnold,'' and war was



declared against President Tyler by the party that elected



him.  Certain it is that no party ever found itself in a



worse position than did the Whigs, when their Vice-President



came into the Chief Magistracy; and equally certain



is it that this position was the richly earned punishment



of their own folly.







I have several times since had occasion to note the



carelessness of National and State conventions in nominating



a candidate for the second place upon the ticket--whether



Vice-President or Lieutenant-Governor.  It would seem



that the question of questions--the nomination to the



first office--having been settled, there comes a sort of



collapse in these great popular assemblies, and that then,



for the second office, it is very often anybody's race and



mainly a matter of chance.  In this way alone can be



explained several nominations which have been made to



second offices, and above all, that of John Tyler.  As a



matter of fact, he was not commended to the Whig party



on any solid grounds.  His whole political life had shown



him an opponent of their main ideas; he was, in fact, a



Southern doctrinaire, and frequently suffered from acute



attacks of that very troublesome political disease,



Virginia metaphysics.  As President he attempted to enforce



his doctrines, and when Whig leaders, and above all



Henry Clay attempted, not only to resist, but to crush him,



he asserted his dignity at the cost of his party, and finally



tried that which other accidental Presidents have since



tried with no better success, namely, to build up a party



of his own by a new distribution of offices.  Never was a



greater failure.  Mr. Tyler was dropped by both parties



and disappeared from American political life forever. 



I can now see that he was a man obedient to his convictions



of duty, such as they were, and in revolt against



attempts of Whig leaders to humiliate him; but then, to



my youthful mind, he appeared the very incarnation of



evil.







My next recollections are of the campaign of 1844. 



Again the Whig party took courage, and having, as a boy



of twelve years, acquired more earnest ideas regarding



the questions at issue, I helped, with other Whig boys,



to raise ash-poles, and to hurrah lustily for Clay at public



meetings.  On the other hand, the Democratic boys hurrahed



as lustily around their hickory poles and, as was



finally proved, to much better purpose.  They sang doggerel



which, to me, was blasphemous, and especially a song



with the following refrain:







   ``Alas poor Cooney Clay,



     Alas poor Cooney Clay,



     You never can be President,



     For so the people say.''







The ash-poles had reference to Ashland, Clay's Kentucky



estate; and the hickory poles recalled General Jackson's



sobriquet, ``Old Hickory.''  For the Democratic candidate



in 1844, James Knox Polk, was considered heir to



Jackson's political ideas.  The campaign of 1844 was not



made so interesting by spectacular outbursts of tom-foolery



as the campaign of 1840 had been.  The sober second



thought of the country had rather sickened people of that



sort of thing; still, there was quite enough of it, especially



as shown in caricatures and songs.  The poorest of the



latter was perhaps one on the Democratic side, for as the



Democratic candidates were Polk of Tennessee and Dallas



of Pennsylvania, one line of the song embraced probably



the worst pun ever made, namely--







     ``PORK in the barrel, and DOLLARS in the pocket.''











It was at this period that the feeling against the extension



of slavery, especially as indicated in the proposed



annexation of Texas, began to appear largely in politics,



and though Clay at heart detested slavery and always



refused to do the bidding of its supporters beyond what he



thought absolutely necessary in preserving the Union, an



unfortunate letter of his led great numbers of anti-



slavery men to support a separate anti-slavery ticket, the



candidate being James G. Birney.  The result was that



the election of Clay became impossible.  Mr. Polk was



elected, and under him came the admission of Texas,



which caused the Mexican War, and gave slavery a new



lease of life.  The main result, in my own environment,



was that my father and his friends, thenceforward for a



considerable time, though detesting slavery, held all



abolitionists and anti-slavery men in contempt,--as unpatriotic



because they had defeated Henry Clay, and as idiotic



because they had brought on the annexation of Texas and



thereby the supremacy of the slave States.







But the flame of liberty could not be smothered by



friends or blown out by enemies; it was kept alive by



vigorous counterblasts in the press, and especially fed by



the lecture system, which was then at the height of its



efficiency.  Among the most powerful of lecturers was



John Parker Hale, senator of the United States from



New Hampshire, his subject being, ``The Last Gladiatorial



Combat at Rome.''  Taking from Gibbon the story of



the monk Telemachus, who ended the combats in the arena



by throwing himself into them and sacrificing his life, Hale



suggested to his large audiences an argument that if men



wished to get rid of slavery in our country they must be



ready to sacrifice themselves if need be.  His words sank



deep into my mind, and I have sometimes thought that



they may have had something to do in leading John



Brown to make his desperate attempt on slavery at



Harper's Ferry.







How blind we all were!  Henry Clay, a Kentucky slave-



holder, would have saved us.  Infinitely better than the



violent solutions proposed to us was his large statesman-



like plan of purchasing the slave children as they were



born and setting them free.  Without bloodshed, and at



cost of the merest nothing as compared to the cost of the



Civil War, he would thus have solved the problem; but



it was not so to be.  The guilt of the nation was not to be



so cheaply atoned for.  Fanatics, North and South,



opposed him and, as a youth, I yielded to their arguments.







Four years later, in 1848, came a very different sort of



election.  General Zachary Taylor, who had shown ster-



ling qualities in the Mexican War, was now the candidate



of the Whigs, and against him was nominated Mr.



Cass, a general of the War of 1812, afterward governor



of the Northwestern Territory, and senator from



Michigan.  As a youth of sixteen, who by that time had become



earnestly interested in politics, I was especially struck



by one event in this campaign.  The Democrats of course



realized that General Taylor, with the prestige gained in



the Mexican War, was a very formidable opponent.  Still,



if they could keep their party together, they had hopes of



beating him.  But a very large element in their party



had opposed the annexation of Texas and strongly disliked



the extension of slavery;--this wing of the party



in New York being known as the ``Barn Burners,'' because



it was asserted that they ``believed in burning the



barn to drive the rats out.''  The question was what these



radical gentlemen would do.  That question was answered



when a convention, controlled largely by the anti-slavery



Democrats of New York and other States, met at Buffalo



and nominated Martin Van Buren to the Presidency. 



For a time it was doubtful whether he would accept the



nomination.  On one side it was argued that he could not



afford to do so, since he had no chance of an election,



and would thereby forever lose his hold upon the Democratic



party; but, on the other hand, it was said that he



was already an old man; that he realized perfectly the



impossibility of his re<e:>lection, and that he had a bitter



grudge against the Democratic candidate, General Cass,



who had voted against confirming him when he was sent



as minister to Great Britain, thus obliging him to return



home ingloriously.  He accepted the nomination.







On the very day which brought the news of this



acceptance, General Cass arrived in Syracuse, on his way



to his home at Detroit.  I saw him welcomed by a great



procession of Democrats, and marched under a broiling



sun, through dusty streets, to the City Hall, where he was



forced to listen and reply to fulsome speeches prophesying



his election, which he and all present knew to be impos-



sible.  For Mr. Van Buren's acceptance of the ``free soil''



nomination was sure to divide the Democratic vote of the



State of New York, thus giving the State to the Whigs;



and in those days the proverb held good, ``As New York



goes, so goes the Union.''







For years afterward there dwelt vividly in my mind



the picture of this old, sad man marching through the



streets, listening gloomily to the speeches, forced to



appear confident of victory, yet evidently disheartened and



disgusted.







Very vivid are my recollections of State conventions



at this period.  Syracuse, as the ``Central City,'' was a



favorite place for them, and, as they came during the



summer vacations, boys of my age and tastes were able



to admire the great men of the hour,--now, alas, utterly



forgotten.  We saw and heard the leaders of all parties. 



Many impressed me; but one dwells in my memory, on



account of a story which was told of him.  This was a



very solemn, elderly gentleman who always looked very



wise but said nothing,--William Bouck of Schoharie



County.  He had white hair and whiskers, and having



been appointed canal commissioner of the State, had



discharged his duties by driving his old white family nag



and buggy along the towing-path the whole length of the



canals, keeping careful watch of the contractors, and so,



in his simple, honest way, had saved the State much money. 



The result was the nickname of the ``Old White Hoss of



Schoharie,'' and a reputation for simplicity and honesty



which made him for a short time governor of the State.







A story then told of him reveals something of his



character.  Being informed that Bishop Hughes of New York



was coming to Albany, and that it would be well to treat



him with especial courtesy, the governor prepared himself



to be more than gracious, and, on the arrival of the



bishop, greeted him most cordially with the words, ``How



do you do, Bishop; I hope you are well.  How did you



leave Mrs. Hughes and your family?''  To this the bishop



answered, ``Governor, I am very well, but there is no



Mrs. Hughes; bishops in our church don't marry.'' 



``Good gracious,'' answered the governor, ``you don't



say so; how long has that been?''  The bishop must have



thoroughly enjoyed this.  His Irish wit made him quick



both at comprehension and repartee.  During a debate



on the school question a leading Presbyterian merchant



of New York, Mr. Hiram Ketchum, made a very earnest



speech against separate schools for Roman Catholics, and



presently, turning to Bishop Hughes, said, ``Sir, we



respect you, sir, but, sir, we can't go your purgatory, sir.'' 



To this the bishop quietly replied, ``You might go further



and fare worse.''







Another leading figure, but on the Whig side, was a



State senator, commonly known as ``Bray'' Dickinson,



to distinguish him from D. S. Dickinson who had been a



senator of the United States, and a candidate for the



Presidency.  ``Bray'' Dickinson was a most earnest



supporter of Mr. Seward; staunch, prompt, vigorous, and



really devoted to the public good.  One story regarding



him shows his rough-and-readiness.







During a political debate in the old Whig days, one



of his Democratic brother senators made a long harangue



in favor of Martin Van Buren as a candidate for the



Presidency, and in the course of his speech referred to



Mr. Van Buren as ``the Curtius of the Republic.''  Upon



this Dickinson jumped up, went to some member better



educated in the classics than himself, and said, ``Who in



thunder is this Curtis that this man is talking about?''  ``It



isn't Curtis, it 's Curtius, ``was the reply.  ``Well, now, ``



said Dickinson, ``what did Curtius do?''  ``Oh,'' said his



informant, ``he threw himself into an abyss to save



the Roman Republic.''  Upon this Dickinson returned to



his seat, and as soon as the Democratic speaker had



finished, arose and said:  ``Mr. President, I deny the justice



of the gentleman's reference to Curtius and Martin Van



Buren.  What did Curtius do?  He threw himself, sir,



into an abyss to save his country.  What, sir, did Martin



Van Buren do?  He threw his country into an abyss to



save himself.''







Rarely, if ever, has any scholar used a bit of classical



knowledge to better purpose.







Another leading figure, at a later period, was a Democrat,



Fernando Wood, mayor of New York, a brilliant



desperado; and on one occasion I saw the henchmen whom



he had brought with him take possession of a State



convention and deliberately knock its president, one of the



most respected men in the State, off the platform.  It was



an unfortunate performance for Mayor Wood, since the



disgust and reaction thereby aroused led all factions of



the Democratic party to unite against him.







Other leading men were such as Charles O'Conor and



John Van Buren; the former learned and generous, but



impracticable; the latter brilliant beyond belief, but not



considered as representing any permanent ideas or principles.







During the campaign of 1848, as a youth of sixteen,



I took the liberty of breaking from the paternal party;



my father voting for General Taylor, I hurrahing for



Martin Van Buren.  I remember well how one day my



father earnestly remonstrated against this.  He said, ``My



dear boy, you cheer Martin Van Buren's name because



you believe that if he is elected he will do something



against slavery: in the first place, he cannot be elected;



and in the second place, if you knew him as we older



people do, you would not believe in his attachment to any



good cause whatever.''







The result of the campaign was that General Taylor



was elected, and I recall the feeling of awe and hope with



which I gazed upon his war-worn face, for the first and



last time, as he stopped to receive the congratulations of



the citizens of Syracuse;--hope, alas, soon brought to



naught, for he, too, soon succumbed to the pressure of



official care, and Millard Fillmore of New York, the Vice-



President, reigned in his stead.







I remember Mr. Fillmore well.  He was a tall, large,



fine-looking man, with a face intelligent and kindly, and



he was noted both as an excellent public servant and an



effective public speaker.  He had been comptroller of



the State of New York,--then the most important of State



offices, had been defeated as Whig candidate for governor,



and had been a representative in Congress.  He was the



second of the accidental Presidents, and soon felt it his



duty to array himself on the side of those who, by



compromise with the South on the slavery question, sought



to maintain and strengthen the Federal Union.  Under



him came the compromise measures on which our great



statesmen of the middle period of the nineteenth century,



Clay, Webster, Calhoun, and Benton, made their last



speeches.  Mr. Fillmore was undoubtedly led mainly by



patriotic motives, in promoting the series of measures



which were expected to end all trouble between the North



and South, but which, unfortunately, embraced the Fugitive



Slave Law; yet this, as I then thought, rendered him



accursed.  I remember feeling an abhorrence for his very



name, and this feeling was increased when there took



place, in the city of Syracuse, the famous ``Jerry Rescue.''















CHAPTER IV



EARLY MANHOOD--1851-1857







On the first day of October, 1851, there was shuffling



about the streets of Syracuse, in the quiet pursuit



of his simple avocations, a colored person, as nearly ``of



no account'' as any ever seen.  So far as was known



he had no surname, and, indeed, no Christian name, save



the fragment and travesty,--``Jerry.''







Yet before that day was done he was famous; his name,



such as it was, resounded through the land; and he had



become, in all seriousness, a weighty personage in American



history.







Under the law recently passed, he was arrested, openly



and in broad daylight, as a fugitive slave, and was carried



before the United States commissioner, Mr. Joseph



Sabine, a most kindly public officer, who in this matter



was sadly embarrassed by the antagonism between his



sworn duty and his personal convictions.







Thereby, as was supposed, were fulfilled the Law and the



Prophets--the Law being the fugitive slave law recently



enacted, and the Prophets being no less than Henry Clay



and Daniel Webster.







For, as if to prepare the little city to sacrifice its



cherished beliefs, Mr. Clay had some time before made a



speech from the piazza of the Syracuse House, urging



upon his fellow-citizens the compromises of the



Constitution; and some months later Mr. Webster appeared,



spoke from a balcony near the City Hall, and to the same



purpose; but more so.  The latter statesman was prophetic,



not only in the hortatory, but in the predictive



sense; for he declared not only that the Fugitive Slave



Law must be enforced, but that it WOULD be enforced, and



he added, in substance: ``it will be enforced throughout



the North in spite of all opposition--even in this city--



even in the midst of your abolition conventions.''  This



piece of prophecy was accompanied by a gesture which



seemed to mean much; for the great man's hand was



waved toward the City Hall just across the square--the



classic seat and center of abolition conventions.







How true is the warning, ``Don't prophesy unless you



know!''  The arrest of Jerry took place within six months



after Mr. Webster's speech, and indeed while an abolition



convention was in session at that same City Hall;



but when the news came the convention immediately



dissolved, the fire-bells began to ring, a crowd moved upon



the commissioner's office, surged into it, and swept Jerry



out of the hands of the officers.  The authorities having



rallied, re-arrested the fugitive, and put him in confinement



and in irons.  But in the evening the assailants returned



to the assault, carried the jail by storm, rescued



Jerry for good, and spirited him off safe and sound to



Canada, thus bringing to nought the fugitive slave law,



as well as the exhortations of Mr. Clay and the predictions



of Mr. Webster.







This rescue produced great excitement throughout the



nation.  Various persons were arrested for taking part



in it, and their trials were adjourned from place to place,



to the great hardship of all concerned.  During a college



vacation I was present at one of these trials at Canandaigua,



the United States Judge, before whom it was held,



being the Hon. N. K. Hall, who had been Mr. Fillmore's



law partner in Buffalo.  The evening before the trial an



anti-slavery meeting was held, which I attended.  It was



opened with prayer by a bishop of the African Methodist



Episcopal Church, Loguen, and of all prayers I have



ever heard, this dwells in my mind as perhaps the most



impressive.  The colored minister's petitions for his race,



bond and free, for Jerry and for those who had sought



to rescue him, for the souls of the kidnappers, and for



the country which was to his people a land of bondage,



were most pathetic.  Then arose Gerrit Smith.  Of all



Tribunes of the People I have ever known he dwells in



my memory as possessing the greatest variety of gifts. 



He had the prestige given by great wealth, by lavish



generosity, by transparent honesty, by earnestness of



purpose, by advocacy of every good cause, by a superb



presence, and by natural eloquence of a very high order.  He



was very tall and large, with a noble head, an earnest, yet



kindly face, and of all human voices I have ever heard



his was the most remarkable for its richness, depth, and



strength.  I remember seeing and hearing him once at



a Republican State Convention in the City Hall at Syracuse,



when, having come in for a few moments as a spectator,



he was recognized by the crowd and greeted



with overwhelming calls for a speech.  He was standing



at the entrance door, towering above all about him, and



there was a general cry for him to come forward to



the platform.  He declined to come forward; but finally



observed to those near him, in his quiet, natural way,



with the utmost simplicity, ``Oh, I shall be heard.''  At



this a shout went up from the entire audience; for every



human being in that great hall had heard these words



perfectly, though uttered in his usual conversational



voice.







I also remember once entering the old Delavan House



at Albany, with a college friend of mine, afterward



Bishop of Maine, and seeing, at the other end of a long



hall, Gerrit Smith in quiet conversation.  In a moment



we heard his voice, and my friend was greatly impressed



by it, declaring he had never imagined such



an utterance possible.  It was indeed amazing; it was



like the deep, clear, rich tone from the pedal bass



of a cathedral organ.  During his career in Congress,



it was noted that he was the only speaker within



remembrance who without effort made himself heard in every



part of the old chamber of the House of Representatives,



which was acoustically one of the worst halls ever



devised.  And it was not a case of voice and nothing else;



his strength of argument, his gift of fit expression, and



his wealth of illustration were no less extraordinary.







On this occasion at Canandaigua he rose to speak, and



every word went to the hearts of his audience.  ``Why,''



he began, ``do they conduct these harassing proceedings



against these men?  If any one is guilty, I am guilty. 



With Samuel J. May I proposed the Jerry Rescue.  We



are responsible for it; why do they not prosecute us?'' 



And these words were followed by a train of cogent



reasoning and stirring appeal.







The Jerry Rescue trials only made matters worse. 



Their injustice disgusted the North, and their futility



angered the South.  They revealed one fact which especially



vexed the Southern wing of the Democratic party, and



this was, that their Northern allies could not be depended



upon to execute the new compromise.  In this Syracuse



rescue one of the most determined leaders was a rough



burly butcher, who had been all his life one of the loudest



of pro-slavery Democrats, and who, until he saw Jerry



dragged in manacles through the streets, had been most



violent in his support of the fugitive slave law.  The



trials also stimulated the anti-slavery leaders and orators



to new vigor.  Garrison, Phillips, Gerrit Smith, Sumner,



and Seward aroused the anti-slavery forces as never



before, and the ``Biglow Papers'' of James Russell Lowell,



which made Northern pro-slavery men ridiculous, were



read with more zest than ever.







But the abolition forces had the defects of their



qualities, and their main difficulty really arose from the



stimulus given to a thin fanaticism.  There followed, in



the train of the nobler thinkers and orators, the ``Fool



Reformers,''--sundry long-haired men and short-haired



women, who thought it their duty to stir good Christian



people with blasphemy, to deluge the founders of the



Republic with blackguardism, and to invent ever more



and more ingenious ways for driving every sober-minded



man and woman out of the anti-slavery fold.  More than



once in those days I hung my head in disgust as I listened



to these people, and wondered, for the moment, whether,



after all, even the supremacy of slaveholders might not



be more tolerable than the new heavens and the new earth,



in which should dwell such bedraggled, screaming,



denunciatory creatures.







At the next national election the Whigs nominated



General Scott, a man of extraordinary merit and of



grandiose appearance; but of both these qualities he was



himself unfortunately too well aware; as a result the



Democrats gave him the name of ``Old Fuss and Feathers,'' and



a few unfortunate speeches, in one of which he expressed



his joy at hearing that ``sweet Irish brogue,'' brought



the laugh of the campaign upon him.







On the other hand the Democrats nominated Franklin



Pierce; a man greatly inferior to General Scott in military



matters, but who had served well in the State politics



of New Hampshire and in Congress, was widely beloved,



of especially attractive manners, and of high personal



character.







He also had been in the Mexican War, but though he



had risen to be brigadier-general, his military record



amounted to very little.  There was in him, no doubt,



some alloy of personal with public motives, but it would



be unjust to say that selfishness was the only source of



his political ideas.  He was greatly impressed by the



necessity of yielding to the South in order to save the



Union, and had shown this by his utterances and votes in



Congress: the South, therefore, accepted him against



General Scott, who was supposed to have moderate anti-



slavery views.







General Pierce was elected; the policy of his



administration became more and more deeply pro-slavery; and



now appeared upon the scene Stephen Arnold Douglas--



senator from Illinois, a man of remarkable ability,--a



brilliant thinker and most effective speaker, with an



extraordinary power of swaying men.  I heard him at vari-



ous times; and even after he had committed what seemed



to me the unpardonable sin, it was hard to resist his



eloquence.  He it was who, doubtless from a mixture of



motives, personal and public, had proposed the abolition of



the Missouri Compromise, which since the year 1820 had



been the bulwark of the new territories against the



encroachments of slavery.  The whole anti-slavery sentiment



of the North was thereby intensified, and as the



establishment of north polarity at one end of the magnet



excites south polarity at the other, so Southern feeling



in favor of slavery was thereby increased.  Up to a recent



period Southern leaders had, as a rule, deprecated



slavery, and hoped for its abolition; now they as generally



advocated it as good in itself;--the main foundation of



civil liberty; the normal condition of the working classes



of every nation; and some of them urged the revival of



the African slave-trade.  The struggle became more and



more bitter.  I was during that time at Yale, and the general



sentiment of that university in those days favored



almost any concession to save the Union.  The venerable



Silliman, and a great majority of the older professors



spoke at public meetings in favor of the pro-slavery



compromise measures which they fondly hoped would settle



the difficulty between North and South and re<e:>stablish



the Union on firm foundations.  The new compromise was



indeed a bitter dose for them, since it contained the



fugitive slave law in its most drastic form; and every one



of them, with the exception of a few theological doctrinaires



who found slavery in the Bible, abhorred the whole



slave system.  The Yale faculty, as a rule, took ground



against anti-slavery effort, and, among other ways of



propagating what they considered right opinions, there



was freely distributed among the students a sermon by



the Rev. Dr. Boardman of Philadelphia, which went to



extremes in advocating compromise with slavery and the



slave power.







The great body of the students, also, from North and



South, took the same side.  It is a suggestive fact that



whereas European students are generally inclined to



radicalism, American students have been, since the war of



the Revolution, eminently conservative.







To this pro-slavery tendency at Yale, in hope of saving



the Union, there were two remarkable exceptions, one



being the beloved and respected president of the university,



Dr. Theodore Dwight Woolsey, and the other his



classmate and friend, the Rev. Dr. Leonard Bacon, pastor



of the great Center Church of New Haven, and frequently



spoken of as the ``Congregational Pope of New



England.''  They were indeed a remarkable pair; Woolsey,



quiet and scholarly, at times irascible, but always kind



and just; Bacon a rugged, leonine sort of man who, when



he shook his mane in the pulpit and addressed the New



England conscience, was heard throughout the nation. 



These two, especially, braved public sentiment, as well



as the opinion of their colleagues, and were supposed,



at the time, to endanger the interests of Yale by standing



against the fugitive slave law and other concessions to



slavery and its extension.  As a result Yale fell into



disrepute in the South, which had, up to that time, sent large



bodies of students to it, and I remember that a classmate



of mine, a tall, harum-scarum, big-hearted, sandy-haired



Georgian known as ``Jim'' Hamilton, left Yale in disgust,



returned to his native heath, and was there welcomed with



great jubilation.  A poem was sent me, written by some



ardent admirer of his, beginning with the words:







     ``God bless thee, noble Hamilton,'' &c.











On the other hand I was one of the small minority of



students who remained uncompromisingly anti-slavery,



and whenever I returned from Syracuse, my classmates



and friends used to greet me in a jolly way by asking me



``How are you, Gerrit; how did you leave the Rev.



Antoinette Brown and brother Fred Douglas?''  In consequence



I came very near being, in a small way, a martyr



to my principles.  Having had some success in winning



essay prizes during my sophomore and junior years, my



name was naturally mentioned in connection with the election



of editors for the ``Yale Literary Magazine.''  At this



a very considerable body of Southern students and their



Northern adherents declared against me.  I neither said



nor did anything in the premises, but two of my most



conservative friends wrought valiantly in my behalf. 



One was my dear old chum, Davies, the present Bishop



of Michigan, at the very antipodes from myself on every



possible question; and the other my life-long friend,



Randall Lee Gibson of Kentucky, himself a large slaveholder,



afterward a general in the Confederate service, and



finally, at his lamented death a few years since, United



States senator from Louisiana.  Both these friends



championed my cause, with the result that they saved me by a



small majority.







As editor of the ``Yale Literary Magazine,'' through



my senior year, I could publish nothing in behalf of my



cherished anti-slavery ideas, since a decided majority



of my fellow-editors would have certainly refused



admission to any obnoxious article, and I therefore confined



myself, in my editorial capacity, to literary and abstract



matters; but with my college exercises it was different. 



Professor Larned, who was charged with the criticism



of our essays and speeches, though a very quiet man, was



at heart deeply anti-slavery, and therefore it was that in



sundry class-room essays, as well as in speeches at the



junior exhibition and at commencement, I was able to



pour forth my ideas against what was stigmatized as the



``sum of human villainies.''







I was not free from temptation to an opposite course. 



My experience at the college election had more than once



suggested to my mind the idea that possibly I might be



wrong, after all; that perhaps the voice of the people was



really the voice of God; that if one wishes to accomplish



anything he must work in harmony with the popular will;



and that perhaps the best way would be to conform to



the general opinion.  To do so seemed, certainly, the only



road to preferment of any kind.  Such were the



temptations which, in those days, beset every young man who



dreamed of accomplishing something in life, and they



beset me in my turn; but there came a day when I dealt



with them decisively.  I had come up across New Haven



Green thinking them over, and perhaps paltering rather



contemptibly with my conscience; but arriving at the door



of North College, I stopped a moment, ran through the



whole subject in an instant, and then and there, on the



stairway leading to my room, silently vowed that, come



what might, I would never be an apologist for slavery



or for its extension, and that what little I could do against



both should be done.







I may add that my conscience was somewhat aided by



a piece of casuistry from the most brilliant scholar in



the Yale faculty of that time, Professor James Hadley. 



I had been brought up with a strong conviction of the



necessity of obedience to law as the first requirement in



any State, and especially in a Republic; but here was the



fugitive slave law.  What was our duty regarding it? 



This question having come up in one of our division-



room debates, Professor Hadley, presiding, gave a decision



to the following effect:  ``On the statute books of all



countries are many laws, obsolete and obsolescent; to



disobey an obsolete law is frequently a necessity and never



a crime.  As to disobedience to an obsolescent law, the



question in every man's mind must be as to the degree



of its obsolescence.  Laws are made obsolescent by change



of circumstances, by the growth of convictions which render



their execution impossible, and the like.  Every man,



therefore, must solemnly decide for himself at what



period a law is virtually obsolete.''







I must confess that the doctrine seems to me now



rather dangerous, but at that time I welcomed it as a very



serviceable piece of casuistry, and felt that there was



indeed, as Mr. Seward had declared, a ``higher law'' than



the iniquitous enactment which allowed the taking of a



peaceful citizen back into slavery, without any of the



safeguards which had been developed under Anglo-Saxon



liberty.







Though my political feelings throughout the senior



year grew more and more intense, there was no chance



for their expression either in competition for the Clarke



Essay Prize or for the De Forest Oration Gold Medal,



the subjects of both being assigned by the faculty; and



though I afterward had the satisfaction of taking both



these, my exultation was greatly alloyed by the thought



that the ideas I most cherished could find little, if any,



expression in them.







But on Commencement Day my chance came.  Then I



chose my own theme, and on the subject of ``Modern



Oracles'' poured forth my views to a church full of people;



many evidently disgusted, but a few as evidently



pleased.  I dwelt especially upon sundry utterances of



John Quincy Adams, who had died not long before, and



who had been, during all his later years, a most earnest



opponent of slavery, and I argued that these, with the



declarations of other statesmen of like tendencies, were the



oracles to which the nation should listen.







Curiously enough this commencement speech secured



for me the friendship of a man who was opposed to my



ideas, but seemed to like my presenting them then and



there--the governor of the State, Colonel Thomas



Seymour.  He had served with distinction in the Mexican



War, had been elected and re<e:>lected, again and again,



governor of Connecticut, was devotedly pro-slavery, in



the interest, as he thought, of preserving the Union; but



he remembered my speech, and afterward, when he was



made minister to Russia, invited me to go with him,



attached me to his Legation, and became one of the dearest



friends I have ever had.







Of the diplomatic phase of my life into which he



initiated me, I shall speak in another chapter; but, as



regards my political life, he influenced me decidedly, for



his conversation and the reading he suggested led me to



study closely the writings of Jefferson.  The impulse



thus given my mind was not spent until the Civil War,



which, betraying the ultimate results of sundry Jeffersonian



ideas, led me to revise my opinions somewhat and



to moderate my admiration for the founder of American



``Democracy,'' though I have ever since retained a strong



interest in his teaching.







But deeply as both the governor and myself felt on the



slavery question, we both avoided it in our conversation. 



Each knew how earnestly the other felt regarding it, and



each, as if by instinct, kept clear of a discussion which



could not change our opinions, and might wreck our



friendship.  The result was, that, so far as I remember,



we never even alluded to it during the whole year we were



together.  Every other subject we discussed freely but



this we never touched.  The nearest approach to a



discussion was when one day in the Legation Chancery at



St. Petersburg, Mr. Erving, also a devoted Union pro-



slavery Democrat, pointing to a map of the United States



hanging on the wall, went into a rhapsody over the



extension of the power and wealth of our country.  I answered,



``If our country could get rid of slavery in all



that beautiful region of the South, such a riddance would



be cheap at the cost of fifty thousand lives and a hundred



millions of dollars.''  At this Erving burst forth



into a torrent of brotherly anger.  ``There was no



conceivable cause,'' he said, ``worth the sacrifice of fifty



thousand lives, and the loss of a hundred millions of



dollars would mean the blotting out of the whole prosperity



of the nation.''  His deep earnestness showed me



the impossibility of converting a man of his opinions,



and the danger of wrecking our friendship by attempting



it.  Little did either of us dream that within ten years



from that day slavery was to be abolished in the United



States, at the sacrifice not of fifty thousand, but of nearly



a million lives, and at the cost not merely of a hundred



millions, but, when all is told, of at least ten thousand



millions of dollars!







I may mention here that it was in this companionship,



at St. Petersburg, that I began to learn why newspaper



criticism has, in our country, so little permanent effect on



the reputation of eminent men.  During four years before



coming abroad I had read, in leading Republican journals



of New York and New Haven, denunciations of Governor



Thomas Hart Seymour as an ignoramus, a pretender,



a blatant demagogue, a sot and companion of sots, an



associate, and fit associate, for the most worthless of the



populace.  I had now found him a man of real convictions,



thoroughly a gentleman, quiet, conscientious, kindly,



studious, thoughtful, modest, abstemious, hardly ever



touching a glass of wine, a man esteemed and beloved by all



who really knew him.  Thus was first revealed to me



what, in my opinion, is the worst evil in American public



life,--that facility for unlimited slander, of which the first



result is to degrade our public men, and the second result



is to rob the press of that confidence among thinking



people, and that power for good and against evil which it



really ought to exercise.  Since that time I have seen



many other examples strengthening the same conviction.







Leaving St. Petersburg, I followed historical and, to



some extent, political studies at the University of Berlin,



having previously given attention to them in France; and



finally, traveling in Italy, became acquainted with a man



who made a strong impression upon me.  This was



Mr. Robert Dale Owen, then the American minister at



Naples, whose pictures of Neapolitan despotism, as it



then existed, made me even a stronger Republican than I



had been before.







Returning to America I found myself on the eve of the



new presidential election.  The Republicans had nominated



John C. Fr<e'>mont, of whom all I knew was gathered



from his books of travel.  The Democrats had nominated



James Buchanan, whom I, as an attach<e'> of the legation



at St. Petersburg, had met while he was minister of the



United States at London.  He was a most kindly and



impressive old gentleman, had welcomed me cordially at



his legation, and at a large dinner given by Mr. George



Peabody, at that time the American Amphitryon in the



British metropolis, discussed current questions in a way



that fascinated me.  Of that I may speak in another chapter;



suffice it here that he was one of the most attractive



men in conversation I have ever met, and that is saying



much.







I took but slight part in the campaign; in fact, a natural



diffidence kept me aloof from active politics.  Having



given up all hope or desire for political preferment, and



chosen a university career, I merely published a few newspaper



and magazine articles, in the general interest of anti-



slavery ideas, but made no speeches, feeling myself, in fact,



unfit to make them.







But I shared more and more the feelings of those who



supported Fr<e'>mont.







Mr. Buchanan, though personal acquaintance had



taught me to like him as a man, and the reading of his



despatches in the archives of our legation at St. Petersburg



had forced me to respect him as a statesman, represented



to me the encroachments and domination of American



slavery, while Fr<e'>mont represented resistance to such



encroachments, and the perpetuity of freedom upon the



American Continent.







On election day, 1856, I went to the polls at the City



Hall of Syracuse to cast my first vote.  There I chanced



to meet an old schoolmate who had become a brilliant



young lawyer, Victor Gardner, with whom, in the old



days, I had often discussed political questions, he being



a Democrat and I a Republican.  But he had now come



upon new ground, and, wishing me to do the same, he



tendered me what was known as ``The American Ticket,''



bearing at its head the name of Millard Fillmore.  He



claimed that it represented resistance to the encroachments



and dangers which he saw in the enormous foreign



immigration of the period, and above all in the



increasing despotism of the Roman Catholic hierarchy



controlling the Irish vote.  Most eloquently did my old



friend discourse on the dangers from this source.  He



insisted that Roman Catholic bishops and priests had



wrecked every country in which they had ever gained



control; that they had aided in turning the mediaeval



republics into despotisms; that they had ruined Spain and



the South American republics; that they had rendered



Poland and Ireland unable to resist oppression; that they



had hopelessly enfeebled Austria and Italy; that by St.



Bartholomew massacres and clearing out of Huguenots



they had made, first, terrorism, and, finally, despotism



necessary in France; that they had rendered every people



they had controlled careless of truth and inclined to



despotism,--either of monarchs or ``bosses'';--that our



prisons were filled with the youth whom they had trained in



religion and morals; that they were ready to ravage the



world with fire and sword to gain the slightest point for



the Papacy; that they were the sworn foes of our public-



school system, without which no such thing as republican



government could exist among us; that, in fact, their



bishops and priests were the enemies of everything we



Americans should hold dear, and that their church was



not so much a religious organization as a political



conspiracy against the best that mankind had achieved.







``Look at the Italians, Spanish, French to-day, ``he



said.  ``The Church has had them under its complete control



fifteen hundred years, and you see the result.  Look



at the Irish all about us;--always screaming for liberty,



yet the most abject slaves of their passions and of their



priesthood.''







He spoke with the deepest earnestness and even



eloquence; others gathered round, and some took his tickets. 



I refused them, saying, ``No.  The question of all questions



to me is whether slavery or freedom is to rule this



Republic,'' and, having taken a Republican ticket, I went



up-stairs to the polls.  On my arrival at the ballot-box



came a most exasperating thing.  A drunken Irish Democrat



standing there challenged my vote.  He had, perhaps,



not been in the country six months; I had lived



in that very ward since my childhood, knew and was



known by every other person present; and such was my



disgust that it is not at all unlikely that if one of



Gardner's tickets had been in my pocket, it would have gone



into the ballot-box.  But persons standing by,--Democrats



as well as Republicans,--having quieted this perfervid 



patriot, and saved me from the ignominy of swearing



in my vote, I carried out my original intention, and



cast my first vote for the Republican candidate.







Certainly Providence was kind to the United States



in that contest.  For Fr<e'>mont was not elected.  Looking



back over the history of the United States I see, thus far,



no instant when everything we hold dear was so much in



peril as on that election day.







We of the Republican party were fearfully mistaken,



and among many evidences in history that there is ``a



Power in the universe, not ourselves, which makes for



righteousness,'' I think that the non-election of Fr<e'>mont



is one of the most convincing.  His election would have



precipitated the contest brought on four years later by



the election of Lincoln.  But the Northern States had in



1856 no such preponderance as they had four years later. 



No series of events had then occurred to arouse and



consolidate anti-slavery feeling like those between 1856 and



1860.  Moreover, of all candidates for the Presidency ever



formally nominated by either of the great parties up to



that time, Fr<e'>mont was probably the most unfit.  He had



gained credit for his expedition across the plains to



California, and deservedly; his popular name of ``Pathfinder''



might have been of some little use in a political campaign,



and some romantic interest attached to him on account of



his marriage with Jessie Benton, daughter of the burly,



doughty, honest-purposed, headstrong senator from Missouri. 



But his earlier career, when closely examined, and,



even more than that, his later career, during the Civil



War, showed doubtful fitness for any duties demanding



clear purpose, consecutive thought, adhesion to a broad



policy, wisdom in counsel, or steadiness in action.  Had



he been elected in 1856 one of two things would 



undoubtedly have followed: either the Union would have



been permanently dissolved, or it would have been 



reestablished by anchoring slavery forever in the 



Constitution. Never was there a greater escape.







On March 1, 1857, I visited Washington for the first



time.  It was indeed the first time I had ever trodden



the soil of a slave State, and, going through Baltimore,



a sense of this gave me a feeling of horror.  The whole



atmosphere of that city seemed gloomy, and the city of



Washington no better.  Our little company established



itself at the National Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue, then



a famous hostelry.  Henry Clay had died there not long



before, and various eminent statesmen had made it, and



were then making it, their headquarters.







On the evening of my arrival a curious occurrence



showed me the difference between Northern and Southern



civilization.  As I sat in the reading-room, there rattled



upon my ear utterances betokening a vigorous dispute in



the adjoining bar-room, and, as they were loud and long,



I rose and walked toward the disputants, as men are wont



to do on such occasions in the North; when, to my surprise



I found that, though the voices were growing steadily



louder, people were very generally leaving the room;



presently, the reason dawned upon me: it was a case in



which revolvers might be drawn at any moment, and the



bystanders evidently thought life and limb more valuable



than any information they were likely to obtain by remaining.







On the evening of the third of March I went with the



crowd to the White House.  We were marshalled through



the halls, President Pierce standing in the small chamber



adjoining the East Room to receive the guests, around



him being members of the Cabinet, with others distinguished



in the civil, military, and naval service, and,



among them, especially prominent, Senator Douglas, then



at the height of his career.  Persons in the procession



were formally presented, receiving a kindly handshake,



and then allowed to pass on.  My abhorrence of the Presi-



dent and of Douglas was so bitter that I did a thing for



which the only excuse was my youth:--I held my right



hand by my side, walked by and refused to be presented.







Next morning I was in the crowd at the east front of the



Capitol, and, at the time appointed, Mr. Buchanan came



forth and took the oath administered to him by the Chief



Justice, Roger Brooke Taney of Maryland.  Though



Taney was very decrepit and feeble, I looked at him much



as a Spanish Protestant in the sixteenth century would



have looked at Torquemada; for, as Chief Justice, he



was understood to be in the forefront of those who would



fasten African slavery on the whole country; and this



view of him seemed justified when, two days after the



inauguration, he gave forth the Dred Scott decision,



which interpreted the Constitution in accordance with



the ultra pro-slavery theory of Calhoun.







Having taken the oath, Mr. Buchanan delivered the



inaugural address, and it made a deep impression upon me. 



I began to suspect then, and I fully believe now, that



he was sincere, as, indeed, were most of those whom



men of my way of thinking in those days attacked as



pro-slavery tools and ridiculed as ``doughfaces.''  We



who had lived remote from the scene of action, and apart



from pressing responsibility, had not realized the danger



of civil war and disunion.  Mr. Buchanan, and men



like him, in Congress, constantly associating with Southern



men, realized both these dangers.  They honestly and



patriotically shrank from this horrible prospect; and so,



had we realized what was to come, would most of us have



done.  I did not see this then, but looking back across



the abyss of years I distinctly see it now.  The leaders



on both sides were honest and patriotic, and, as I firmly



believe, instruments of that ``Power in the universe, not



ourselves, which makes for righteousness.''







There was in Mr. Buchanan's inaugural address a tone



of deep earnestness.  He declared that all his efforts



should be given to restore the Union, and to re<e:>stablish



it upon permanent foundations; besought his fellow-citizens



throughout the Union to second him in this effort,



and promised that under no circumstances would he be



a candidate for re<e:>lection.  My anti-slavery feelings



remained as deep as ever, but, hearing this speech, there



came into my mind an inkling of the truth:  ``Hinter dem



Berge sind auch Leute.''







During my stay in Washington I several times visited



the Senate and the House, in the old quarters which they



shortly afterward vacated in order to enter the more



commodious rooms of the Capitol, then nearly finished. 



The Senate was in the room at present occupied by the



Supreme Court, and from the gallery I looked down



upon it with mingled feelings of awe, distrust, and



aversion.  There, as its president, sat Mason of Virginia,



author of the fugitive slave law; there, at the desk in



front of him, sat Cass of Michigan, who, for years, had



been especially subservient to the slave power; Douglas



of Illinois, who had brought about the destruction of the



Missouri Compromise; Butler of South Carolina, who



represented in perfection the slave-owning aristocracy;



Slidell and Benjamin of Louisiana, destined soon to play



leading parts in the disruption of the Union.







But there were others.  There was Seward, of my own



State, whom I had been brought up to revere, and who



seemed to me, in the struggle then going on, the



incarnation of righteousness; there was Charles Sumner of



Massachusetts, just recovering from the murderous



blows given him by Preston Brooks of South Carolina,



--a martyr, as I held, to his devotion to freedom; there



was John Parker Hale of New Hampshire, who had



been virtually threatened with murder, as a penalty for



his opposition to slavery; and there was bluff Ben Wade



of Ohio, whose courage strengthened the whole North.







The House of Representatives interested me less.  In



it there sat various men now mainly passed out of



human memory; and, unfortunately, the hall, though



one of the finest, architecturally, in the world, was one



of the least suited to its purpose.  To hear anything



either in the galleries or on the floor was almost an



impossibility.







The Supreme Court, though sitting in a wretched



room in the basement, made a far deeper impression



upon me.  The judges, seated in a row, and wearing



their simple, silken gowns, seemed to me, in their quiet



dignity, what the highest court of a great republic ought



to be; though I looked at Chief Justice Taney and his



pro-slavery associates much as a Hindoo regards his



destructive gods.







The general impression made upon me at Washington



was discouraging.  It drove out from my mind the last



lingering desire to take any part in politics.  The whole



life there was repulsive to me, and when I reflected that



a stay of a few years in that forlorn, decaying, reeking



city was the goal of political ambition, the whole thing



seemed to me utterly worthless.  The whole life there



bore the impress of the slipshod habits engendered by



slavery, and it seemed a civilization rotting before



ripeness.  The city was certainly, at that time, the most



wretched capital in Christendom.  Pennsylvania Avenue



was a sort of Slough of Despond,--with ruts and mud-



holes from the unfinished Capitol, at one end, to the



unfinished Treasury building, at the other, and bounded



on both sides with cheap brick tenements.  The extensive



new residence quarter and better hotels of these



days had not been dreamed of.  The ``National,'' where



we were living, was esteemed the best hotel, and it was



abominable.  Just before we arrived, what was known



as the ``National Hotel Disease'' had broken out in it;--



by some imputed to an attempt to poison the incoming



President, in order to bring the Vice-President into his



place.  But that was the mere wild surmise of a political



pessimist.  The fact clearly was that the wretched



sewage of Washington, in those days, which was betrayed



in all parts of the hotel by every kind of noisome odor,



had at last begun to do its work.  Curiously enough there



was an interregnum in the reign of sickness and death,



probably owing to some temporary sanitary efforts, and



that interregnum, fortunately for us, was coincident with



our stay there.  But the disease set in again shortly



afterward, and a college friend of mine, who arrived on the



day of our departure, was detained in the hotel for many



weeks with the fever then contracted.  The number of



deaths was considerable, but, in the interest of the hotel,



the matter was hushed up, as far as possible.







The following autumn I returned to New Haven as a



resident graduate, and, the popular lecture system being



then at its height, was invited to become one of the



lecturers in the course of that winter.  I prepared my



discourse with great care, basing it upon studies and



observations during my recent stay in the land of the



Czar, and gave it the title of ``Civilization in Russia.''







I remember feeling greatly honored by the fact that



my predecessor in the course was Theodore Parker, and



my successor Ralph Waldo Emerson.  Both talked with



me much about my subject, and Parker surprised me. 



He was the nearest approach to omniscience I had ever



seen.  He was able to read, not only Russian, but the



Old Slavonic.  He discussed the most intimate details of



things in Russia, until, at last, I said to him, ``Mr.



Parker, I would much rather sit at your feet and listen



to your information regarding Russia, than endeavor



to give you any of my own.'' He was especially



interested in the ethnology of the empire, and had an



immense knowledge of the different peoples inhabiting



it, and of their characteristics.  Finally, he asked me



what chance I thought there was for the growth of



anything like free institutions in Russia.  To this I



answered that the best thing they had was their system



of local peasant meetings for the repartition of their



lands, and for the discussion of subjects connected with



them, and that this seemed to me something like a germ



of what might, in future generations, become a sort of



town-meeting system, like that of New England.  This



let me out of the discussion very satisfactorily, for



Parker told me that he had arrived at the same



conclusion, after talking with Count Gurowski, who was, in



those days, an especial authority.







In due time came the evening for my lecture.  As it



was the first occasion since leaving college that I had



appeared on any stage, a considerable number of my old



college associates and friends, including Professor



(afterward President) Porter, Dr. Bacon, and Mr. (afterward



Bishop) Littlejohn, were there among the foremost, and



after I had finished they said some kindly things, which



encouraged me.







In this lecture I made no mention of American slavery,



but into an account of the events of my stay at St.



Petersburg and Moscow during the Crimean War, and



of the death and funeral of the Emperor Nicholas, with



the accession and first public address of Alexander II,



I sketched, in broad strokes, the effects of the serf



system,--effects not merely upon the serfs, but upon the



serf owners, and upon the whole condition of the empire. 



I made it black indeed, as it deserved, and though



not a word was said regarding things in America, every



thoughtful man present must have felt that it was the



strongest indictment against our own system of slavery



which my powers enabled me to make.







Next day came a curious episode.  A classmate of mine,



never distinguished for logical acuteness, came out in a



leading daily paper with a violent attack upon me and



my lecture.  He lamented the fact that one who, as he said,



had, while in college, shown much devotion to the anti-



slavery cause, had now faced about, had no longer the



courage of his opinions, and had not dared say a word



against slavery in the United States.  The article was



laughable.  It would have been easy to attack slavery and



thus at once shut the minds and hearts of a large majority



of the audience.  But I felt then, as I have generally felt



since, that the first and best thing to do is to SET PEOPLE AT



THINKING, and to let them discover, or think that they



discover, the truth for themselves.  I made no reply, but an



eminent clergyman of New Haven took up the cudgels in



my favor, covered my opponent with ridicule, and did me



the honor to declare that my lecture was one of the most



effective anti-slavery arguments ever made in that city. 



With this, I retired from the field well satisfied.







The lecture was asked for in various parts of the country,



was delivered at various colleges and universities, and



in many cities of western New York, Michigan, and Ohio;



and finally, after the emancipation of the serfs, was re-



cast and republished in the ``Atlantic Monthly'' under the



title of ``The Rise and Decline of the Serf System in



Russia.''







And now occurred a great change in my career which,



as I fully believed, was to cut me off from all political life



thoroughly and permanently.  This was my election to



the professorship of history and English literature in the



University of Michigan.















CHAPTER V







THE CIVIL WAR PERIOD--1857-1864







Arriving at the University of Michigan in October,



1857, I threw myself into my new work most heartily. 



Though I felt deeply the importance of the questions



then before the country, it seemed to me that the only



way in which I could contribute anything to their solution



was in aiding to train up a new race of young men who



should understand our own time and its problems in the



light of history.







It was not difficult to point out many things in the past



that had an important bearing upon the present, and my



main work in this line was done in my lecture-room.  I



made no attempts to proselyte any of my hearers to either



political party, my main aim being then, as it has been



through my life, when dealing with students and the public



at large, to set my audience or my readers at thinking,



and to give them fruitful historical subjects to think



upon.  Among these subjects especially brought out in



dealing with the middle ages, was the origin, growth, and



decline of feudalism, and especially of the serf system,



and of municipal liberties as connected with it.  This, of



course, had a general bearing upon the important problem



we had to solve in the United States during the second half



of that century.







In my lectures on modern history, and especially on the



Reformation period, and the events which led to the



French Revolution, there were various things throwing



light upon our own problems, which served my purpose



of arousing thought.  My audiences were large and attentive,



and I have never, in the whole course of my life,



enjoyed any work so much as this, which brought me into



hearty and close relations with a large body of active-



minded students from all parts of our country, and



especially from the Northwest.  More and more I realized



the justice of President Wayland's remark, which had so



impressed me at the Yale Alumni meeting just after my



return from Europe: that the nation was approaching



a ``switching-off place''; that whether we were to turn



toward evil or good in our politics would be decided by the



great Northwest, and that it would be well for young



Americans to cast in their lot with that part of the country.







In the intervals of my university work many invitations



came to me from associations in various parts of Michigan



and neighboring States to lecture before them, and these



I was glad to accept.  Such lectures were of a much more



general character than those given in the university, but



by them I sought to bring the people at large into trains



of thought which would fit them to grapple with the great



question which was rising more and more portentously



before us.







Having accepted, in one of my vacations, an invitation



to deliver the Phi Beta Kappa Commencement Address



at Yale, I laid down as my thesis, and argued it from



history, that in all republics, ancient or modern, the worst



foe of freedom had been a man-owning aristocracy--an



aristocracy based upon slavery.  The address was circulated



in printed form, was considerably discussed, and, I



trust, helped to set some few people thinking.







For the same purpose I also threw some of my lectures



into the form of magazine articles for the ``Atlantic



Monthly,'' and especially one entitled ``The Statesmanship



of Richelieu,'' my effort in this being to show that the



one great error of that greatest of all French statesmen



was in stopping short of rooting out the serf system in



France when he had completely subjugated the serf owners



and had them at his mercy.







As the year 1860 approached, the political struggle



became more and more bitter.  President Buchanan in 



redeeming his promise to maintain the Union had gone to



lengths which startled and disappointed many of his most



devoted supporters.  Civil war had broken out in Kansas



and Nebraska, with murder and massacre: desperate



attempts were made to fasten the hold of the pro-slavery



party permanently upon the State, and as desperately were



these efforts repelled.  A certain John Brown, who requited



assassination of free-state men by the assassination



of slave-state men,--a very ominous appearance,--began



to be heard of; men like Professor Silliman, who, during



my stay at Yale had spoken at Union meetings in favor of



the new compromise measures, even including the fugitive



slave law, now spoke publicly in favor of sending rifles to



the free-state men in Kansas; and, most striking symptom



of all, Stephen A. Douglas himself, who had led the



Democratic party in breaking the Missouri Compromise, now



recoiled from the ultra pro-slavery propaganda of President



Buchanan.  Then, too, came a new incitement to



bitterness between North and South.  John Brown, the



man of Scotch-Covenanter type, who had imbibed his



theories of political methods from the Old-Testament



annals of Jewish dealings with the heathen, and who had in



Kansas solemnly slaughtered in cold blood, as a sort of



sacrifice before the Lord, sundry Missouri marauders who



had assassinated free-state men, suddenly appeared in



Virginia, and there, at Harper's Ferry, with a handful of



fanatics subject to his powerful will, raised the standard



of revolution against the slave-power.  Of course he was



easily beaten down, his forces scattered, those dearest to



him shot, and he himself hanged.  But he was a character



of antique mold, and this desperate effort followed by his



death, while it exasperated the South, stirred the North to



its depths.







Like all such efforts, it was really mistaken and



unfortunate.  It helped to obscure Henry Clay's proposal to



extinguish slavery peaceably, and made the solution of the



problem by bloodshed more and more certain.  And in the



execution of John Brown was lost a man who, had he



lived until the Civil War, might have rendered enormous



services as a partizan leader.  Of course, his action aroused



much thought among my students, and their ideas came



out in their public discussions.  It was part of my duty,



once or twice a week, to preside over these discussions, and



to decide between the views presented.  In these decisions



on the political questions now arising I became deeply



interested, and while I was careful not to give them a partizan



character, they were, of course, opposed to the dominance



of slavery.







In the spring of 1860, the Republican National Convention



was held at Chicago, and one fine morning I went to



the railway station to greet the New York delegation on



its way thither.  Among the delegates whom I especially



recall were William M. Evarts, under whose Secretaryship



of State I afterward served as minister at Berlin,



and my old college friend, Stewart L. Woodford, with



whom I was later in close relations during his term as



lieutenant-governor of New York and minister to Spain. 



The candidate of these New York delegates was of course



Mr. Seward, and my most devout hopes were with him,



but a few days later came news that the nomination had



been awarded to Mr. Lincoln.  Him we had come to know



and admire during his debates with Douglas while the



senatorial contest was going on in the State of Illinois;



still the defeat of Mr. Seward was a great disappointment,



and hardly less so in Michigan than in New York.  In the



political campaign which followed I took no direct part,



though especially aroused by the speeches of a new man



who had just appeared above the horizon,--Carl Schurz. 



His arguments seemed to me by far the best of that whole



campaign--the broadest, the deepest, and the most convincing.







My dear and honored father, during the months of July,



August, and the first days of September, was slowly fading



away on his death-bed.  Yet he was none the less interested



in the question at issue, and every day I sat by



his bedside and read to him the literature bearing upon



the contest; but of all the speeches he best liked those of



this new orator--he preferred them, indeed, to those of his



idol Seward.







I have related in another place how, years afterward,



Bismarck asked me, in Berlin, to what Carl Schurz's great



success in America was due, and my answer to this question.







Mr. Lincoln having been elected, I went on with my



duties as before, but the struggle was rapidly deepening. 



Soon came premonitions of real conflict, and, early in the



following spring, civil war was upon us.  My teaching



went on, as of old, but it became more direct.  In order



to show what the maintenance of a republic was worth,



and what patriots had been willing to do for their country



in a struggle not unlike ours, I advised my students to read



Motley's ``History of the Dutch Republic,'' and I still



think it was good advice.  Other works, of a similar



character, showing how free peoples have conducted long and



desperate wars for the maintenance of their national existence



and of liberty, I also recommended, and with good effect.







Reverses came.  During part of my vacation, in the summer



of 1861, I was at Syracuse, and had, as my guest, Mr.



George Sumner, younger brother of the eminent senator



from Massachusetts, a man who had seen much of the



world, had written magazine articles and reviews which



had done him credit, and whose popular lectures were



widely esteemed.  One Sunday afternoon in June my



uncle, Mr. Hamilton White, dropped in at my house to



make a friendly call.  He had just returned from Washington,



where he had seen his old friend Seward, Mr. Lincoln's



Secretary of State, and felt able to give us a forecast



of the future.  This uncle of mine was a thoughtful



man of affairs; successful in business, excellent in judgment,



not at all prone to sanguine or flighty views, and on



our asking him how matters looked in Washington he



said, ``Depend upon it, it is all right:  Seward says that



they have decided to end the trouble at once, even if it is



necessary to raise an army of fifty thousand men;--that



they will send troops immediately to Richmond and finish



the whole thing at once, so that the country can go on



quietly about its business.''







There was, of course, something reassuring in so



favorable a statement made by a sensible man fresh from



the most accredited sources, and yet I could not resist



grave doubts.  Such historical knowledge as I possessed



taught me that a struggle like that just beginning between



two great principles, both of which had been gathering



force for nearly a century, and each of which had drawn



to its support millions of devoted men, was not to be ended



so easily; but I held my peace.







Next day I took Mr. Sumner on an excursion up the



beautiful Onondaga Valley.  As we drove through the



streets of Syracuse, noticing knots of men gathered here



and there in discussion, and especially at the doors of the



news offices, we secured an afternoon newspaper and drove



on, engaged in earnest conversation.  It was a charming



day, and as we came to the shade of some large trees about



two miles from the city we rested and I took out the paper. 



It struck me like death.  There, displayed in all its horrors,



was the first account of the Battle of Bull Run,--



which had been fought the previous afternoon,--exactly



at the time when my uncle was assuring us that the United



States Army was to march at once to Richmond and end



the war.  The catastrophe seemed fatal.  The plans of



General McDowell had come utterly to nought; our army



had been scattered to the four winds; large numbers of



persons, including sundry members of Congress who had



airily gone out with the army to ``see the fun,'' among



them one from our own neighborhood, Mr. Alfred Ely,



of Rochester, had been captured and sent to Richmond,



and the rebels were said to be in full march on the National



Capital.







Sumner was jubilant.  ``This,'' he said, ``will make the



American people understand what they have to do; this



will stop talk such as your uncle gave us yesterday 



afternoon.''  But to me it was a fearful moment.  Sumner's



remarks grated horribly upon my ears; true as his view



was, I could not yet accept it.







And now preparations for war, and, indeed, for repelling



invasion, began in earnest.  My friends all about me



were volunteering, and I also volunteered, but was rejected



with scorn; the examining physician saying to me,



``You will be a burden upon the government in the first



hospital you reach; you have not the constitution to be



of use in carrying a musket; your work must be of a



different sort.''







My work, then, through the summer was with those who



sought to raise troops and to provide equipments for



them.  There was great need of this, and, in my opinion,



the American people have never appeared to better



advantage than at that time, when they began to realize their



duty, and to set themselves at doing it.  In every city,



village, and hamlet, men and women took hold of the work,



feeling that the war was their own personal business.  No



other country since the world began has ever seen a more



noble outburst of patriotism or more efficient aid by



individuals to their government.  The National and State



authorities of course did everything in their power; but



men and women did not wait for them.  With the exception



of those whose bitter partizanship led them to oppose



the war in all its phases, men, women, and children



engaged heartily and efficiently in efforts to aid the Union



in its struggle.







Various things showed the depths of this feeling.  I



remember meeting one day, at that period, a man who had



risen by hard work from simple beginnings to the head



of an immense business, and had made himself a multi-



millionaire.  He was a hard, determined, shrewd man of



affairs, the last man in the world to show anything like



sentimentalism, and as he said something advising an



investment in the newly created National debt, I answered,



``You are not, then, one of those who believe that our



new debt will be repudiated?''  He answered:  ``Repudia-



tion or no repudiation, I am putting everything I can rake



and scrape together into National bonds, to help this



government maintain itself; for, by G--d, if I am not



to have any country, I don't want any money.''  It is



to be hoped that this oath, bursting forth from a patriotic



heart, was, like Uncle Toby's, blotted out by the recording



angel.  I have quoted it more than once to show how



the average American--though apparently a crude materialist--



is, at heart, a thorough idealist.







Returning to the University of Michigan at the close



of the vacation, I found that many of my students had



enlisted, and that many more were preparing to do so.  With



some it was hard indeed.  I remember two especially, who



had for years labored and saved to raise the money which



would enable them to take their university course; they



had hesitated, for a time, to enlist; but very early one



morning I was called out of bed by a message from them,



and, meeting them, found them ready to leave for the



army.  They could resist their patriotic convictions no



longer, and they had come to say good-bye to me.  They



went into the war; they fought bravely through the thickest



of it; and though one was badly wounded, both lived



to return, and are to-day honored citizens.  With many



others it was different; many, very many of them, alas,



were among the ``unreturning brave!'' and loveliest and



noblest of all, my dear friend and student, Frederick Arne,



of Princeton, Illinois, killed in the battle of Shiloh, at the



very beginning of the war, when all was blackness and



discouragement.  Another of my dearest students at that time



was Albert Nye.  Scholarly, eloquent, noble-hearted, with



every gift to ensure success in civil life, he went forth



with the others, rose to be captain of a company, and I



think major of a regiment.  He sent me most kindly messages,



and at one time a bowie-knife captured from a rebel



soldier.  But, alas! he was not to return.







I may remark, in passing, that while these young men



from the universities, and a vast host of others from



different walks of life, were going forth to lay down their



lives for their country, the English press, almost without



exception, from the ``Times'' down, was insisting that we



were fighting our battles with ``mercenaries.''







One way in which those of us who remained at the



university helped the good cause was in promoting the



military drill of those who had determined to become soldiers. 



It was very difficult to secure the proper military instruction,



but in Detroit I found a West Point graduate, engaged



him to come out a certain number of times every week to



drill the students, and he cheered us much by saying that



he had never in his life seen soldiers so much in earnest,



and so rapid in making themselves masters of the drill



and tactics.







One of my advisers at this period, and one of the



noblest men I have ever met, was Lieutenant Kirby Smith,



a graduate of West Point, and a lieutenant in the army. 



His father, after whom he was named, had been killed at



the Battle of Molino del Rey, in the Mexican War.  His



uncle, also known as Kirby Smith, was a general in the



Confederate service.  His mother, one of the dearest



friends of my family, was a woman of extraordinary abilities,



and of the noblest qualities.  Never have I known a



young officer of more promise.  With him I discussed



from time to time the probabilities of the war.  He was



full of devotion, quieted my fears, and strengthened



my hopes.  He, too, fought splendidly for his country, and



like his father, laid down his life for it.







The bitterest disappointment of that period, and I regret



deeply to chronicle it, was the conduct of the government



and ruling classes in England.  In view of the fact that



popular sentiment in Great Britain, especially as voiced



in its literature, in its press, and from its pulpit, had been



against slavery, I had never doubted that in this struggle,



so evidently between slavery and freedom, Great Britain



would be unanimously on our side.  To my amazement



signs soon began to point in another direction.  More and



more it became evident that British feeling was against



us.  To my students, who inquired how this could possibly



be, I said, ``Wait till Lord John Russell speaks.''  Lord



John Russell spoke, and my heart sank within me.  He was



the solemnly constituted impostor whose criminal carelessness



let out the Alabama to prey upon our commerce,



and who would have let out more cruisers had not Mr.



Charles Francis Adams, the American minister, brought



him to reason.







Lord John Russell was noted for his coolness, but in



this respect Mr. Adams was more than his match.  In



after years I remember a joke based upon this characteristic. 



During a very hot summer in Kansas, when the



State was suffering with drought, some newspaper proposed,



and the press very generally acquiesced in the suggestion,



that Mr. Charles Francis Adams should be asked



to take a tour through the State, in order, by his presence,



to reduce its temperature.







When, therefore, Lord John Russell showed no signs



of interfering with the sending forth of English ships,--



English built, English equipped, and largely English



manned,--against our commerce, Mr. Adams, having



summed up to his Lordship the conduct of the British



Government in the matter, closed in his most icy way with



the words:  ``My lord, I need hardly remind you that this



is war.''







The result was, that tardily,--just in time to prevent war



between the two nations,--orders were given which prevented



the passing out of more cruisers.







Goldwin Smith, who in the days of his professorship at



Oxford, saw much of Lord John Russell, once told me that



his lordship always made upon him the impression of



``an eminent corn-doctor.''







During the following summer, that of 1863, being much



broken down by overwork, and threatened, as I supposed,



with heart disease, which turned out to be the beginning



of a troublesome dyspepsia, I was strongly recommended



by my physician to take a rapid run to Europe, and though



very reluctant to leave home, was at last persuaded to go



to New York to take my passage.  Arrived there, bad news



still coming from the seat of war, I could not bring myself



at the steamer office to sign the necessary papers, finally



refused, and having returned home, took part for the first



time in a political campaign as a speaker, going through



central New York, and supporting the Republican candidate



against the Democratic.  The election seemed of



vast importance.  The Democrats had nominated for the



governorship, Mr. Horatio Seymour, a man of the highest



personal character, and, so far as the usual duties of



governor were concerned, admirable; but he had been



bitterly opposed to the war, and it seemed sure that his



election would encourage the South and make disunion



certain; therefore it was that I threw myself into the



campaign with all my might, speaking night and day; but



alas! the election went against us.







At the close of the campaign, my dyspepsia returning



with renewed violence, I was thinking what should be done,



when I happened to meet my father's old friend, Mr.



Thurlow Weed, a devoted adherent of Mr. Seward through



his whole career, and, at that moment, one of the main



supports of the Lincoln Administration.  It was upon the



deck of a North River steamer, and on my mentioning my



dilemma he said:  ``You can just now do more for us



abroad than at home.  You can work in the same line with



Archbishop Hughes, Bishop McIlvaine, and myself; everything



that can be done, in the shape of contributions to



newspapers, or speeches, even to the most restricted



audiences abroad, will help us: the great thing is to gain



time, increase the number of those who oppose European



intervention in our affairs, and procure takers for our



new National bonds.''







The result was that I made a short visit to Europe,



stopping first in London.  Political feeling there was



bitterly against us.  A handful of true men, John Bright and



Goldwin Smith at the head of them, were doing heroic



work in our behalf, but the forces against them seemed



overwhelming.  Drawing money one morning in one of



the large banks of London, I happened to exhibit a few



of the new National greenback notes which had been



recently issued by our Government.  The moment the clerk



saw them he called out loudly, ``Don't offer us any of



those things; we don't take them; they will never be good



for anything.''  I was greatly vexed, of course, but there



was no help for it.  At another time I went into a famous



book-shop near the Haymarket to purchase a rare book



which I had long coveted.  It was just after the Battle of



Fredericksburg.  The book-seller was chatting with a



customer, and finally, with evident satisfaction, said to him: 



``I see the Yankees have been beaten again.''  ``Yes,'' said



the customer, ``and the papers say that ten thousand of



them have been killed.''  ``Good,'' said the shop-keeper,



``I wish it had been twice as many.''  Of course it was



impossible for me to make any purchase in that place.







In order to ascertain public sentiment I visited certain



``discussion forums,'' as they are called, frequented by



contributors to the press and young lawyers from the



Temple and Inns of Court.  In those places there was, as



a rule, a debate every night, and generally, in one form



or another, upon the struggle then going on in the



United States.  There was, perhaps, in all this a trifle



too much of the Three Tailors of Tooley Street; still,



excellent speeches were frequently made, and there was a



pleasure in doing my share in getting the company on the



right side.  On one occasion, after one of our worst



reverses during the war, an orator, with an Irish brogue,



thickened by hot whisky, said, ``I hope that Republic of



blackguards is gone forever.''  But, afterward, on learning



that an American was present, apologized to me in a



way effusive, laudatory, and even affectionate.







But my main work was given to preparing a pamphlet,



in answer to the letters from America by Dr. Russell,



correspondent of the London ``Times.''  Though nominally



on our side, he clearly wrote his letters to suit the demands



of the great journal which he served, and which was most



bitterly opposed to us.  Nothing could exceed its virulence



against everything American.  Every occurrence was



placed in the worst light possible as regarded our



interests, and even the telegraphic despatches were manipulated



so as to do our cause all the injury possible.  I therefore



prepared, with especial care, an answer to these letters



of Dr. Russell, and published it in London.  Its fate



was what might have been expected.  Some papers discussed



it fairly, but, on the whole, it was pooh-poohed, explained



away, and finally buried under new masses of slander. 



I did, indeed, find a few friends of my country in



Great Britain.  In Dublin I dined with Cairnes, the



political economist, who had earnestly written in behalf of the



Union against the Confederates; and in London, with Professor



Carpenter, the eminent physiologist, who, being



devoted to anti-slavery ideas, was mildly favorable to the



Union side.  But I remember him less on account of anything



he said relating to the struggle in America, than for



a statement bearing upon the legitimacy of the sovereign



then ruling in France, who was at heart one of our most



dangerous enemies.  Dr. Carpenter told me that some time



previously he had been allowed by Nassau Senior, whose



published conversations with various men of importance



throughout Europe had attracted much attention, to look



into some of the records which Mr. Senior had not thought



it best to publish, and that among them he had read the



following:







``---- showed me to-day an autograph letter written by



Louis Bonaparte, King of Holland, not far from the time



of the birth of his putative son, now Napoleon III.  One



passage read as follows:  `J'ai le malheur d'avoir pour



femme une Messalene.  Elle a des amants partout, et



partout elle laise des enfants.' ''







I could not but think of this a few weeks later when I



saw the emperor, who derived his title to the throne of



France from his nominal father, poor King Louis, but



whose personal appearance, like that of his brother, the



Duc de Morny, was evidently not derived from any Bonaparte. 



All the J<e'>rome Napoleons I have ever seen, including



old King J<e'>rome of Westphalia, and Prince Na-



poleon J<e'>rome, otherwise known as ``Plon-Plon,'' whom



I saw during my student life at Paris, and the eldest son



of the latter, the present Bonaparte pretender to the



Napoleonic crown of France, whom I saw during my stay



as minister at St. Petersburg, very strikingly resembled



the first Napoleon, though all were of much larger size. 



But the Louis Napoleons, that is, the emperor and his



brother the Duc de Morny, had no single Napoleonic



point in their features or bearing.







I think that the most startling inspiration during my



life was one morning when, on walking through the Garden



of the Tuileries, I saw, within twenty feet of me, at



a window, in the old palace, which afterward disappeared



under the Commune, the emperor and his minister of



finance, Achille Fould, seated together, evidently in earnest



discussion.  There was not at that time any human



being whom I so hated and abhorred as Napoleon III. 



He had broken his oath and trodden the French republic



under his feet, he was aiding to keep down the aspirations



of Italy, and he was doing his best to bring on an



intervention of Europe, in behalf of the Confederate States, to



dissolve our Union.  He was then the arbiter of Europe. 



The world had not then discovered him to be what Bismarck



had already found him--``a great unrecognized incapacity,''



and, as I looked up and distinctly saw him so



near me, there flashed through my mind an understanding



of some of the great crimes of political history, such as I



have never had before or since.[1]











[1] Since writing this I find in the Autobiography of W. J.



Stillman that a similar feeling once beset him on seeing this



imperial malefactor,















In France there was very little to be done for our cause. 



The great mass of Frenchmen were either indifferent or



opposed to us.  The only exception of importance was



Laboulaye, professor at the Coll<e!>ge de France, and his



lecture-room was a center of good influences in favor of



the American cause; in the midst of that frivolous



Napoleonic France he seemed by far ``the noblest Roman of



them all.''







The main effort in our behalf was made by Mr. John



Bigelow, at that time consul-general, but afterward minister



of the United States,--to supply with arguments the



very small number of Frenchmen who were inclined to



favor the Union cause, and this he did thoroughly well.







Somewhat later there came a piece of good fortune. 



Having been sent by a physician to the baths at Homburg,



I found as our consul-general, at the neighboring city of



Frankfort-on-the-Main, William Walton Murphy of Michigan,



a life-long supporter of Mr. Seward, a most devoted



and active American patriot;--a rough diamond; one of



the most uncouth mortals that ever lived; but big-hearted,



shrewd, a general favorite, and prized even by those who



smiled at his oddities.  He had labored hard to induce the



Frankfort bankers to take our government bonds, and to



recommend them to their customers, and had at last been



successful.  In order to gain and maintain this success he



had established in Frankfort a paper called ``L'Europe,''



for which he wrote and urged others to write.  To this



journal I became a contributor, and among my associates I



especially remember the Rev. Dr. John McClintock, formerly



president of Dickinson College, and Dr. E. H.



Chapin, of New York, so eminent in those days as a



preacher.  Under the influence of Mr. Murphy, Frankfort-



on-the-Main became, and has since remained, a center of



American ideas.  Its leading journal was the only influential



daily paper in Germany which stood by us during



our Spanish War.







I recall a story told me by Mr. Murphy at that period. 



He had taken an American lady on a business errand to



the bank of Baron Rothschild, and, after their business was



over, presented her to the great banker.  It happened that



the Confederate loan had been floated in Europe by Baron



Erlanger, also a Frankfort financial magnate, and by birth



a Hebrew.  In the conversation that ensued between this



lady and Baron Rothschild, the latter said:  ``Madam, my



sympathies are entirely with your country; but is it not



disheartening to think that there are men in Europe who



are lending their money and trying to induce others to



lend it for the strengthening of human slavery?  Madam,



NONE BUT A CONVERTED JEW WOULD DO THAT.''







On the Fourth of July of that summer, Consul-General



Murphy--always devising new means of upholding the



flag of his country--summoned Americans from every



part of Europe to celebrate the anniversary of our



National Independence at Heidelberg, and at the dinner given



at the Hotel Schreider seventy-four guests assembled,



including two or three professors from the university, as



against six guests from the Confederate States, who had



held a celebration in the morning at the castle.  Mr. Murphy



presided and made a speech which warmed the hearts



of us all.  It was a thorough-going, old-fashioned, Western



Fourth of July oration.  I had jeered at Fourth of July



orations all my life, but there was something in this one



which showed me that these discourses, so often ridiculed,



are not without their uses.  Certain it is that as the consul-



general repeated the phrases which had more than once



rung through the Western clearings, in honor of the



defenders of our country, the divine inspiration of the



Constitution, our invincibility in war and our superiority in



peace, all of us were encouraged and cheered most lustily. 



Pleasing was it to note various British tourists standing



at the windows listening to the scream of the American



eagle and evidently wondering what it all meant.







Others of us spoke, and especially Dr. McClintock, one



of the foremost thinkers, scholars, and patriots that the



Methodist Episcopal church has ever produced.  His



speech was in a very serious vein, and well it might be.  In



the course of it he said:  ``According to the last accounts



General Lee and his forces are near the town where I live,



and are marching directly toward it.  It is absolutely certain



that, if they reach it, they will burn my house and all



that it contains, but I have no fear; I believe that the Almighty



is with us in this struggle, and though we may suffer



much before its close, the Union is to endure and slavery



is to go down before the forces of freedom.''  These



words, coming from the heart of a strong man, made a



deep impression upon us all.







About two weeks later I left Frankfort for America,



and at my parting from Consul-General Murphy at the



hotel, he said:  ``Let me go in the carriage with you; this



is steamer-day and we shall probably meet the vice-consul



coming with the American mail.''  He got in, and we



drove along the Zeil together.  It was at the busiest time



of the day, and we had just arrived at the point in that



main street of Frankfort where business was most active,



when the vice-consul met us and handed Mr. Murphy a



newspaper.  The latter tore it open, read a few lines,



and then instantly jumped out into the middle of the street,



waved his hat and began to shout.  The public in general



evidently thought him mad; a crowd assembled; but as



soon as he could get his breath he pointed out the headlines



of the newspaper.  They indicated the victories of Gettysburg



and Vicksburg, and the ending of the war.  It was,



indeed, a great moment for us all.







Arriving in America, I found that some friends had



republished from the English edition my letter to Dr.



Russell, that it had been widely circulated, and that, at any



rate, it had done some good at home.







Shortly afterward, being on a visit to my old friend,



James T. Fields of Boston, I received a telegram from



Syracuse as follows:  ``You are nominated to the State



senate: come home and see who your friends are.''  I



have received, in the course of my life, many astonishing



messages, but this was the most unexpected of all.  I had



not merely not been a candidate for any such nomination,



but had forgotten that any nomination was to be made; I



had paid no attention to the matter whatever; all my



thoughts had been given to other subjects; but on returning



to Syracuse I found that a bitter contest having arisen



between two of the regular candidates, each representing a



faction, the delegates had suddenly turned away from both



and nominated me.  My election followed and so began



the most active phase of my political life.















CHAPTER VI







SENATORSHIP AT ALBANY--1864-1865







On the evening of New Year's Day, 1864, I arrived in



Albany to begin my duties in the State Senate, and



certainly, from a practical point of view, no member of the



legislature was more poorly equipped.  I had, indeed,



received a university education, such as it was, in those



days, at home and abroad, and had perhaps read more than



most college-bred men of my age, but all my education,



study, and reading were remote from the duties now assigned



me.  To history, literature, and theoretical politics,



I had given considerable attention, but as regarded the



actual necessities of the State of New York, the relations



of the legislature to the boards of supervisors of



counties, to the municipal councils of cities, to the boards



of education, charity, and the like, indeed, to the whole



system throughout the Commonwealth, and to the



modes of conducting public and private business, my



ignorance was deplorable.  Many a time have I envied some



plain farmer his term in a board of supervisors, or some



country schoolmaster his relations to a board of education,



or some alderman his experience in a common council, or



some pettifogger his acquaintance with justices' courts. 



My knowledge of law and the making of law was wretchedly



deficient, and my ignorance of the practical administration



of law was disgraceful.  I had hardly ever been



inside a court-house, and my main experience of legal



procedure was when one day I happened to step into court



at Syracuse, and some old friends of mine thought it a



good joke to put a university professor as a talesman upon



a jury in a horse case.  Although pressed with business



I did not flinch, but accepted the position, discharged its



duties, and learned more of legal procedure and of human



nature in six hours than I had ever before learned in six



months.  Ever afterward I advised my students to get



themselves drawn upon a petit jury.  I had read some



Blackstone and some Kent and had heard a few law



lectures, but my knowledge was purely theoretical:



in constitutional law it was derived from reading



scattered essays in the ``Federalist,'' with extracts here



and there from Story.  Of the State charitable and



penal institutions I knew nothing.  Regarding colleges



I was fairly well informed, but as to the practical



working of our system of public instruction I had



only the knowledge gained while a scholar in a public



school.









There was also another disadvantage.  I knew nothing



of the public men of the State.  Having lived outside of



the Commonwealth, first, as a student at Yale, then during



nearly three years abroad, and then nearly six years as a



professor in another State, I knew only one of my



colleagues, and of him I had only the knowledge that came



from an introduction and five minutes' conversation ten



years before.  It was no better as regarded my acquaintance



with the State officers; so far as I now remember, I



had never seen one of them, except at a distance,--the



governor, Mr. Horatio Seymour.







On the evening after our arrival the Republican



majority of the Senate met in caucus, partly to become



acquainted, partly to discuss appointments to committees,



and partly to decide on a policy regarding State aid to



the prosecution of the war for the Union.  I found myself



the youngest member of this body, and, indeed, of



the entire Senate, but soon made the acquaintance of my



colleagues and gained some friendships which have been



among the best things life has brought me.







Foremost in the State Senate, at that period, was



Charles James Folger, its president.  He had served in



the Senate several years, had been a county judge, and



was destined to become assistant treasurer of the United



States at New York, chief justice of the highest State



court, and finally, to die as Secretary of the Treasury of



the United States, after the most crushing defeat which



any candidate for the governorship of New York had ever



known.  He was an excellent lawyer, an impressive



speaker, earnestly devoted to the proper discharge of his



duties, and of extraordinarily fine personal appearance. 



His watch upon legislation sometimes amused me, but always



won my respect.  Whenever a bill was read a third



time he watched it as a cat watches a mouse.  His hatred of



doubtful or bad phraseology was a passion.  He was



greatly beloved and admired, yet, with all his fine and



attractive qualities, modest and even diffident to a fault.







Another man whom I then saw for the first time



interested me much as soon as his name was called, and he



would have interested me far more had I known how



closely my after life was to be linked with his.  He was



then about sixty years of age, tall, spare, and austere,



with a kindly eye, saying little, and that little dryly.  He



did not appear unamiable, but there seemed in him a sort



of aloofness: this was Ezra Cornell.







Still another senator was George H. Andrews, from



the Otsego district, the old Palatine country.  He had



been editor of one of the leading papers in New York,



and had been ranked among the foremost men in his



profession, but he had retired into the country to lead the



life of a farmer.  He was a man to be respected and even



beloved.  His work for the public was exceedingly valuable,



and his speeches of a high order.  Judge Folger,



as chairman of the judiciary committee, was most useful



to the State at large in protecting it from evil legislation. 



Senator Andrews was not less valuable to the cities, and



above all to the city of New York, for his intelligent



protection of every good measure, and his unflinching



opposition to every one of the many doubtful projects



constantly brought in by schemers and dreamers.







Still another senator was James M. Cook of Saratoga. 



He had been comptroller of the State and, at various



times, a member of the legislature.  He was the faithful



``watch-dog of the treasury,''--bitter against every



scheme for taking public money for any unworthy purpose,



and, indeed, against any scheme whatever which



could not assign for its existence a reason, clear, cogent,



and honest.







Still another member, greatly respected, was Judge



Bailey of Oneida County.  His experience upon the bench



made him especially valuable upon the judiciary and



other committees.







Yet another man of mark in the body was one of the



younger men, George G. Munger of Rochester.  He had



preceded me by a few years at Yale, had won respect



as a county judge, and had a certain lucid way of



presenting public matters which made him a valuable public



servant.







Another senator of great value was Henry R. Low. 



He, too, had been a county judge and brought not only



legal but financial knowledge to the aid of his colleagues. 



He was what Thomas Carlyle called a ``swallower of



formulas.''  That a thing was old and revered mattered



little with him: his question was what is the best thing



NOW.







From the city of New York came but one Republican,



William Laimbeer, a man of high character and large



business experience; impulsive, but always for right



against wrong; kindly in his nature, but most bitter



against Tammany and all its works.







From Essex County came Senator Palmer Havens, also



of middle age, of large practical experience, with a clear,



clean style of thinking and speaking, anxious to make a



good record by serving well, and such a record he certainly made.







And, finally, among the Republican members of that



session I may name the senator from Oswego, Mr. Cheney



Ames.  Perhaps no one in the body had so large a prac-



tical knowledge of the commercial interests of the State,



and especially of the traffic upon its lakes and inland



waterways; on all questions relating to these his advice



was of the greatest value; he was in every respect a



good public servant.







On the Democratic side the foremost man by far was



Henry C. Murphy of Brooklyn, evidently of Irish ancestry,



though his immediate forefathers had been long in



the United States.  He was a graduate of Columbia College,



devoted to history and literature, had produced sundry



interesting books on the early annals of the State,



had served with distinction in the diplomatic service as



minister to The Hague, was eminent as a lawyer, and



had already considerable legislative experience.







From New York City came a long series of Democratic



members, of whom the foremost was Thomas C. Fields. 



He had considerable experience as a lawyer in the city



courts, had served in the lower house of the legislature,



and was preternaturally acute in detecting the interests



of Tammany which he served.  He was a man of much



humor, with occasional flashes of wit, his own worst



enemy, evidently, and his career was fitly ended when



upon the fall of Tweed he left his country for his country's



good and died in exile.







There were others on both sides whom I could mention



as good men and true, but those I have named took a



leading part as heads of committees and in carrying on



public business.







The lieutenant-governor of the State who presided over



the Senate was Mr. Floyd-Jones, a devoted Democrat of



the old school who exemplified its best qualities; a



gentleman, honest, courteous, not intruding his own views,



ready always to give the fullest weight to those of others



without regard to party.







Among the men who, from their constant attendance,



might almost be considered as officers of the Senate were



sundry representatives of leading newspapers.  Several



of them were men of marked ability, and well known



throughout the State, but they have long since been



forgotten with one exception: this was a quiet reporter who



sat just in front of the clerk's chair, day after day, week



after week, throughout the entire session; a man of very



few words, and with whom I had but the smallest



acquaintance.  Greatly surprised was I in after years when



he rose to be editor of the leading Democratic organ



in the State, and finally, under President Cleveland, a



valuable Secretary of the Treasury of the United States:



Daniel Manning.







In the distribution of committees there fell to me the



chairmanship of the committee on education, or, as it



was then called, the committee on literature.  I was also



made a member of the committee on cities and villages,



afterward known as the committee on municipal affairs,



and of the committee on the library.  For the first of



these positions I was somewhat fitted by my knowledge



of the colleges and universities of the State, but in other



respects was poorly fitted.  For the second of these



positions, that of the committee on cities and villages, I am



free to confess that no one could be more wretchedly



equipped; for the third, the committee on the library, my



qualifications were those of a man who loved both to collect



books and to read them.







But from the beginning I labored hard to fit myself,



even at that late hour, for the duties pressing upon me,



and gradually my practical knowledge was increased. 



Still there were sad gaps in it, and more than once I sat



in the committee-room, looking exceedingly wise, no



doubt, but with an entirely inadequate appreciation of



the argument made before me.







During this first session my maiden speech was upon



the governor's message, and I did my best to show what



I thought His Excellency's shortcomings.  Governor Seymour



was a patriotic man, after his fashion, but the one



agency which he regarded as divinely inspired was the



Democratic party; his hatred of the Lincoln Administration



was evidently deep, and it was also clear that he



did not believe that the war for the Union could be brought



to a successful termination.







With others I did my best against him; but while



condemning his political course as severely as was possible



to me, I never attacked his personal character or his



motives.  The consequence was that, while politically we



were enemies, personally a sort of friendship remained,



and I recall few things with more pleasure than my



journeyings from Albany up the Mohawk Valley, sitting at



his side, he giving accounts to me of the regions through



which we passed, and the history connected with them,



regarding which he was wonderfully well informed.  If



he hated New England as the breeding bed of radicalism,



he loved New York passionately.







The first important duty imposed upon me as chairman



of the committee on education was when there came



up a bill for disposing of the proceeds of public lands



appropriated by the government of the United States



to institutions for scientific and technical education, under



what was then known as the Morrill Act of 1862.  Of



these lands the share which had come to New York was



close upon a million acres--a fair-sized European



principality.  Here, owing to circumstances which I shall



detail in another chapter, I found myself in a contest with



Mr. Cornell.  I favored holding the fund together, letting



it remain with the so-called ``People's College,'' to



which it had been already voted, and insisted that the



matter was one to be referred to the committee on education. 



Mr. Cornell, on the other hand, favored the division



of the fund, and proposed a bill giving one half of



it to the ``State Agricultural College'' recently



established at Ovid on Seneca Lake.  The end was that the



matter was referred to a joint committee composed of



the committees on literature and agriculture, that is, to



Mr. Cornell's committee and my own, and as a result no



meeting to consider the bill was held during that session.







Gradually I accumulated a reasonable knowledge of



the educational interests intrusted to us, but ere long



there came in from the superintendent of public



instruction; Mr. Victor Rice, a plan for codifying the



educational laws of the State.  This necessitated a world of



labor on my part.  Section by section, paragraph by



paragraph, phrase by phrase, I had to go through it, and



night after night was devoted to studying every part



of it in the light of previous legislation, the laws of other



States, and such information as could be obtained from



general sources.  At last, after much alteration and revision,



I brought forward the bill, secured its passage,



and I may say that it was not without a useful influence



upon the great educational interests of the State.







I now brought forward another educational bill.  Various



persons interested in the subject appeared urging



the creation of additional State normal schools, in order



to strengthen and properly develop the whole State



school system.  At that time there was but one; that one at



Albany; and thus our great Commonwealth was in this



respect far behind many of her sister States.  The whole



system was evidently suffering from the want of teachers



thoroughly and practically equipped.  Out of the multitude



of projects presented, I combined what I thought



the best parts of three or four in a single bill, and



although at first there were loud exclamations against so



lavish a use of public money, I induced the committee



to report my bill, argued it in the Senate, overcame much



opposition, and thus finally secured a law establishing



four State normal schools.







Still another duty imposed upon me necessitated much



work for which almost any other man in the Senate would



have been better equipped by experience and knowledge



of State affairs.  The condition of things in the city of



New York had become unbearable; the sway of Tammany



Hall had gradually brought out elements of opposition



such as before that time had not existed.  Tweed



was already making himself felt, though he had not yet



assumed the complete control which he exercised afterward. 



The city system was bad throughout; but at the



very center of evil stood what was dignified by the name



of the ``Health Department.''  At the head of this was a



certain Boole, who, having gained the title of ``city



inspector,'' had the virtual appointment of a whole army



of so-called ``health inspectors,'' ``health officers,'' and



the like, charged with the duty of protecting the public



from the inroads of disease; and never was there a



greater outrage against a city than the existence of this



body of men, absolutely unfit both as regarded character



and education for the duties they pretended to discharge.







Against this state of things there had been developed



a ``citizens' committee,'' representing the better elements



of both parties,--its main representatives being Judge



Whiting and Mr. Dorman B. Eaton,--and the evidence



these gentlemen exhibited before the committee on municipal



affairs, at Albany, as to the wretched condition of



the city health boards was damning.  Whole districts in



the most crowded wards were in the worst possible sanitary



condition.  There was probably at that time nothing



to approach it in any city in Christendom save, possibly,



Naples.  Great blocks of tenement houses were owned by



men who kept low drinking bars in them, each of whom,



having secured from Boole the position of ``health



officer,'' steadily resisted all sanitary improvement or



even inspection.  Many of these tenement houses were



known as ``fever nests''; through many of them small-



pox frequently raged, and from them it was constantly



communicated to other parts of the city.







Therefore it was that one morning Mr. Laimbeer, the



only Republican member from the city, rose, made an



impassioned speech on this condition of things, moved a



committee to examine and report, and named as its members



Judge Munger, myself, and the Democratic senator



from the Buffalo district, Mr. Humphrey.







As a result, a considerable part of my second winter



as senator was devoted to the work of this special committee



in the city of New York.  We held a sort of court,



had with us the sergeant-at-arms, were empowered to send



for persons and papers, summoned large numbers of



witnesses, and brought to view a state of things even worse



than anything any of us had suspected.







Against the citizens' committee, headed by Judge Whiting



and Mr. Eaton, Boole, aided by a most successful



Tammany lawyer of the old sort, John Graham, fought



with desperation.  In order to disarm his assailants as



far as possible, he brought before the committee a number



of his ``health officers'' and ``sanitary inspectors,''



whom he evidently thought best qualified to pass muster;



but as one after another was examined and cross-examined,



neither the cunning of Boole nor the skill of Mr.



Graham could prevent the revelation of their utter unfitness. 



In the testimony of one of them the whole monstrous



absurdity culminated.  Judge Whiting examining



him before the commission with reference to a case of



small-pox which had occurred within his district, and to



which, as health officer it was his duty to give attention,



and asking him if he remembered the case, witness answered



that he did.  The following dialogue then ensued:











Q.  Did you visit this sick person?







A.  No, sir.







Q.  Why did you not?







A.  For the same reason that you would not.







Q.  What was that reason?







A.  I did n't want to catch the disease myself.







Q.  Did the family have any sort of medical aid?







A.  Yes.







Q.  From whom did they have it?







A.  From themselves; they was ``highjinnicks'' (hygienics).







Q.  What do you mean by ``highjinnicks''?







A.  I mean persons who doctor themselves.







After other answers of a similar sort the witness



departed; but for some days afterward Judge Whiting



edified the court, in his examination of Boole's health



officers and inspectors, by finally asking each one whether



he had any ``highjinnicks'' in his health district.  Some



answered that they had them somewhat; some thought



that they had them ``pretty bad,'' others thought that



there was ``not much of it,'' others claimed that they



were ``quite serious''; and, finally, in the examination of



a certain health officer who was very anxious to show that



he had done his best, there occurred the following dialogue



which brought down the house:







Q.  (By Judge Whiting.)  Mr. Health Officer, have you



had any ``highjinnicks'' in your district?







A.  Yes, sir.







Q.  Much?







A.  Yes, sir, quite a good deal.







Q.  Have you done anything in regard to them?







A.  Yes, sir; I have done all that I could.







Q.  Witness, now, on your oath, do you know what the



word ``highjinnicks'' means?







A.  Yes, sir.







Q.  What does it mean?







A.  It means the bad smells that arise from standing



water.







At this the court was dissolved in laughter, but Mr.



Graham made the best that he could of it by the following



questions and answers:







Q.  Witness, have you ever learned Greek?







A.  No, sir.







Q.  Can you speak Greek?







A.  No, sir.







Q.  Do you understand Greek?







A.  No, sir.







``Then you may stand down.''







The examination was long and complicated, so that



with various departments to be examined there was no



time to make a report before the close of the session, and



the whole matter had to go over until the newly elected



senate came into office the following year.







Shortly after the legislature had adjourned I visited



the city of New York, and on arriving took up the evening



paper which, more than any other, has always been supposed to



represent the best sentiment of the city;--the



``New York Evening Post.''  The first article on which my



eye fell was entitled ``The New York Senate Trifling,''



and the article went on to say that the Senate of the



State had wasted its time, had practically done nothing



for the city, had neglected its interests, had paid no



attention to its demands, and the like.  That struck me



as ungrateful, for during the whole session we had



worked early and late on questions relating to the city,



had thwarted scores of evil schemes, and in some cases,



I fear, had sacrificed the interests of the State at large



to those of the city.  Thus there dawned on me a knowledge



of the reward which faithful legislators are likely



to obtain.







Another of these city questions also showed the sort



of work to be done in this thankless protection of the



metropolis.  During one of the sessions there had



appeared in the lobby an excellent man, Dr. Levi Silliman



Ives, formerly Protestant Episcopal Bishop of North



Carolina, who, having been converted to Roman Catholicism,



had become a layman and head of a protectory



for Catholic children.  With him came a number of



others of his way of thinking, and a most determined



effort was made to pass a bill sanctioning a gift of one



half of the great property known as Ward's Island,



adjacent to the city of New York, to this Roman Catholic



institution.







I had strong sympathy with the men who carried on



the protectory, and was quite willing to go as far as



possible in aiding them, but was opposed to voting such



a vast landed property belonging to the city into the



hands of any church, and I fought the bill at all stages. 



In committee of the whole, and at first reading, priestly



influence led a majority to vote for it, but at last, despite



all the efforts of Tammany Hall, it was defeated.







It was during this first period of my service that the



last and most earnest effort of the State was made for



the war.  Various circumstances had caused discourage-



ment.  It had become difficult to raise troops, yet it was



most important to avoid a draft.  In the city of New



York, at the prospect of an enforced levy of troops,



there had been serious uprisings which were only



suppressed after a considerable loss of life.  It was



necessary to make one supreme effort, and the Republican



members of the legislature decided to raise a loan of



several millions for bounties to those who should



volunteer.  This decision was not arrived at without much



opposition, and, strange to say, its most serious opponent



was Horace Greeley, who came to Albany in the



hope of defeating it.  Invaluable as his services had been



during the struggle which preceded the war, it must be



confessed, even by his most devoted friends, that during



the war he was not unfrequently a stumbling block.  His



cry ``on to Richmond'' during the first part of the



struggle, his fearful alarm when, like the heroes in the



``Biglow Papers,'' he really discovered ``why baggonets is



peaked,'' his terror as the conflict deepened, his proposals



for special peace negotiations later--all these things



were among the serious obstacles which President Lincoln



had to encounter; and now, fearing burdens which,



in his opinion, could not and would not be borne by the



State, and conjuring up specters of trouble, he came to



Albany and earnestly advised members of the legislature



against the passage of the bounty bill.  Fortunately,



common sense triumphed, and the bill was passed.







Opposition came also from another and far different



source.  There was then in the State Senate a Democrat



of the oldest and strongest type; a man who believed



most devoutly in Jefferson and Jackson, and abhorred



above all things, abolitionists and protectionists,--Dr.



Allaben of Schoharie.  A more thoroughly honest man



never lived; he was steadily on the side of good legislation;



but in the midst of the discussion regarding this



great loan for bounties he arose and began a speech



which, as he spoke but rarely, received general attention.



He was deeply in earnest.  He said (in substance), ``I



shall vote for this loan; for of various fearful evils it



seems the least.  But I wish, here and now, and with the



deepest sorrow, to record a prediction: I ask you to note



it and to remember it, for it will be fulfilled, and speedily. 



This State debt which you are now incurring will never



be paid.  It cannot be paid.  More than that, none of the



vast debts incurred for military purposes, whether by



the Nation or by the States, will be paid; the people will



surely repudiate them.  Nor is this all.  Not one dollar



of all the treasury notes issued by the United States will



ever be redeemed.  Your paper currency has already



depreciated much and will depreciate more and more; all



bonds and notes, State and National, issued to continue



this fratricidal war will be whirled into the common



vortex of repudiation.  I say this with the deepest pain, for



I love my country, but I cannot be blind to the teachings



of history.''  He then went on to cite the depreciation



of our revolutionary currency, and, at great length



pictured the repudiation of the assignats during the French



Revolution.  He had evidently read Alison and Thiers



carefully, and he spoke like an inspired prophet.







As Senator Allaben thus spoke, Senator Fields of New



York quietly left his seat and came to me.  He was a



most devoted servant of Tammany, but was what was



known in those days as a War Democrat.  His native



pugnacity caused him to feel that the struggle must be



fought out, whereas Democrats of a more philosophic



sort, like Allaben, known in those days as ``Copperheads,''



sought peace at any price.  Therefore it was that,



while Senator Allaben was pouring out with the deepest



earnestness these prophecies of repudiation, Mr. Fields



came round to my desk and said to me:  ``You have been



a professor of history; you are supposed to know something



about the French Revolution; if your knowledge



is good for anything, why in h--l don't you use it now?''







This exhortation was hardly necessary, and at the close



of Senator Allaben's remarks I arose and presented



another view of the case.  It happened by a curious coin-



cidence that, having made a few years before a very careful



study of the issues of paper money during the French



Revolution, I had a portion of my very large collection



of assignats, mandats, and other revolutionary currency



in Albany, having brought it there in order to show



it to one or two of my friends who had expressed an



interest in the subject.







Holding this illustrative material in reserve I showed



the whole amount of our American paper currency in



circulation to be about eight hundred million dollars, of



which only about one half was of the sort to which the



senator referred.  I then pointed to the fact that, although



the purchasing power of the French franc at the time of



the Revolution was fully equal to the purchasing power



of the American dollar of our own time, the French



revolutionary government issued, in a few months, forty-



five thousand millions of francs in paper money, and had



twenty-five thousand millions of it in circulation at the



time when the great depression referred to by Dr. Allaben



had taken place.







I also pointed out the fact that our American notes were



now so thoroughly well engraved that counterfeiting was



virtually impossible, so that one of the leading European



governments had its notes engraved in New York, on this



account, whereas, the French assignats could be easily



counterfeited, and, as a matter of fact, were counterfeited



in vast numbers, the British government pouring them



into France through the agency of the French royalists,



especially in Brittany, almost by shiploads, and to such



purpose, that the French government officials themselves



were at last unable to discriminate between the genuine



money and the counterfeit.  I also pointed out the



connection of our national banking system with our issues



of bonds and paper, one of the happiest and most statesmanlike



systems ever devised, whereas, in France there



was practically no redemption for the notes, save as they



could be used for purchasing from the government the



doubtful titles to the confiscated houses and lands of the



clergy and aristocracy.







The speech of Senator Allaben had exercised a real



effect, but these simple statements, which I supported by



evidence, and especially by exhibiting specimens of the



assignats bearing numbers showing that the issues had



risen into the thousands of millions, and in a style of



engraving most easily counterfeited, sufficed to convince the



Senate that no such inference as was drawn by the senator



was warranted by the historical facts in the case.







A vote was taken, the bill was passed, the troops were



finally raised, and the debt was extinguished not many



years afterward.







It is a pleasure for me to remember that at the close



of my remarks, which I took pains to make entirely



courteous to Dr. Allaben, he came to me, and strongly



opposed as we were in politics, he grasped me by the hand



most heartily, expressed his amazement at seeing these



assignats, mandats, and other forms of French revolutionary



issues, of which he had never before seen one,



and thanked me for refuting his arguments.  It is one of



the very few cases I have ever known, in which a speech



converted an opponent.







Perhaps a word more upon this subject may not be



without interest.  My attention had been drawn to the



issues of paper money during the French Revolution, by



my studies of that period for my lectures on modern



history at the University of Michigan, about five years



before.  In taking up this special subject I had supposed



that a few days would be sufficient for all the study



needed; but I became more and more interested in it,



obtained a large mass of documents from France, and then



and afterward accumulated by far the largest collection of



French paper money, of all the different issues, sorts,



and amounts, as well as of collateral newspaper reports



and financial documents, ever brought into our country. 



The study of the subject for my class, which I had hoped



to confine to a few days, thus came to absorb my leisure



for months, and I remember that, at last, when I had



given my lecture on the subject to my class at the university,



a feeling of deep regret, almost of remorse, came



over me, as I thought how much valuable time I had given



to a subject that, after all, had no bearing on any present



problem, which would certainly be forgotten by the



majority of my hearers, and probably by myself.







These studies were made mainly in 1859.  Then the



lectures were laid aside, and though, from time to time,



when visiting France, I kept on collecting illustrative



materials, no further use was made of them until this debate



during the session of the State Senate of 1864.







Out of this offhand speech upon the assignats grew a



paper which, some time afterward, I presented in



Washington before a number of members of the Senate and



House, at the request of General Garfield, who was then



a representative, and of his colleague, Mr. Chittenden of



Brooklyn.  In my audience were some of the foremost



men of both houses, and among them such as Senators



Bayard, Stevenson, Morrill, Conkling, Edmunds, Gibson,



and others.  This speech, which was the result of



my earlier studies, improved by material acquired later,



and most carefully restudied and verified, I repeated



before a large meeting of the Union League Club at New



York, Senator Hamilton Fish presiding.  The paper thus



continued to grow and, having been published in New



York by Messrs. Appleton, a cheap edition of it was



circulated some years afterward, largely under the auspices



of General Garfield, to act as an antidote to the ``Greenback



Craze'' then raging through Ohio and the Western



States.







Finally, having been again restudied, in the light of my



ever-increasing material, it was again reprinted and



circulated as a campaign document during the struggle



against Mr. Bryan and the devotees of the silver standard



in the campaign of 1896, copies of it being spread



very widely, especially through the West, and placed,



above all, in nearly every public library, university,



college, and normal school in the Union.







I allude to this as showing to any young student who



may happen to read these recollections, the value of a careful



study of any really worthy subject, even though, at



first sight, it may seem to have little relation to present



affairs.







In the spring of 1864, at the close of my first year in



the State Senate, came the national convention at Baltimore



for the nomination of President and Vice-President,



and to that convention I went as a substitute delegate. 



Although I have attended several similar assemblages since,



no other has ever seemed to me so interesting.  It met in



an old theater, on one of the noisiest corners in the city,



and, as it was June, and the weather already very warm,



it was necessary, in order to have as much air as possible,



to remove curtains and scenery from the stage and throw



the back of the theater open to the street.  The result



was, indeed, a circulation of air, but, with this, a noise



from without which confused everything within.







In selecting a president for the convention a new



departure was made, for the man chosen was a clergyman;



one of the most eminent divines in the Union,--the Rev.



Dr. Robert Breckinridge of Kentucky, who, on the



religious side, had been distinguished as moderator of the



Presbyterian General Assembly, and on the political side



was revered for the reason that while very nearly all his



family, and especially his sons and nephews, including



the recent Vice-President, had plunged into the Confederate



service, he still remained a staunch and sturdy adherent



of the Union and took his stand with the Republican



party.  He was a grand old man, but hardly suited



to the presidency of a political assemblage.







The proceedings were opened with a prayer by a



delegate, who had been a colonel in the Union army, and was



now a Methodist clergyman.  The heads of all were



bowed, and the clergyman-soldier began with the words of



the Lord's Prayer; but when he had recited about one half



of it he seemed to think that he could better it, and he



therefore substituted for the latter half a petition which



began with these words:  ``Grant, O Lord, that the ticket



here to be nominated may command a majority of the



suffrages of the American people.''  To those accustomed



to the more usual ways of conducting service this was



something of a shock; still there was this to be said in



favor of the reverend colonel's amendment,--he had faith



to ask for what he wanted.







This opening prayer being ended, there came a display



of parliamentary tactics by leaders from all parts of the



Union: one after another rose in this or that part of the



great assemblage to move this or that resolution, and the



confusion which soon prevailed was fearful, the noise of



the street being steadily mingled with the tumult of the



house.  But good Dr. Breckinridge did his best, and



in each case put the motion he had happened to hear. 



Thereupon each little group, supposing that the resolution



which had been carried was the one it had happened



to hear, moved additional resolutions based upon it. 



These various resolutions were amended in all sorts of



ways, in all parts of the house, the good doctor putting



the resolutions and amendments which happened to reach



his ear, and declaring them ``carried'' or ``lost,'' as the



case might be.  Thereupon ensued additional resolutions



and amendments based upon those which their movers



supposed to have been passed, with the result that, in



about twenty minutes no one in the convention, and least



of all its president, knew what we had done or what we



ought to do.  Each part of the house firmly believed that



the resolutions which it had heard were those which had



been carried, and the clash and confusion between them all



seemed hopeless.







Various eminent parliamentarians from different parts



of the Union arose to extricate the convention from this



welter, but generally, when they resumed their seats, left



the matter more muddled than when they arose.







A very near approach to success was made by my dear



friend George William Curtis of New York, who, in



admirable temper, and clear voice, unraveled the tangle,



as he understood it, and seemed just about to start the



convention fairly on its way, when some marplot arose



to suggest that some minor point in Mr. Curtis's exposition



was not correct, thus calling out a tumult of conflicting



statements, the result of which was yet greater



confusion, so that we seemed fated to adjourn pell-mell



into the street and be summoned a second time into



the hall, in order to begin the whole proceedings over



again.







But just at this moment arose Henry J. Raymond, editor



of the ``New York Times.''  His parliamentary training



had been derived not only from his service as lieutenant-



governor of the State, but from attendance on a



long series of conventions, State and National.  He had



waited for his opportunity, and when there came a lull



of despair, he arose and, in a clear, strong, pleasant voice,



made an alleged explanation of the situation.  As a piece



of parliamentary tactics, it was masterly though from



another point of view it was comical.  The fact was that



he developed a series of motions and amendments:--a



whole line of proceedings,--mainly out of his own interior



consciousness.  He began somewhat on this wise:  ``Mr.



President:  The eminent senator from Vermont moved



a resolution to such an effect; this was amended as follows,



by my distinguished friend from Ohio, and was



passed as amended.  Thereupon the distinguished senator



from Iowa arose and made the following motion, which,



with an amendment from the learned gentleman from



Massachusetts, was passed; thereupon a resolution was



moved by the honorable gentleman from Pennsylvania,



which was declared by the chair to be carried; and now,



sir, I submit the following motion,'' and he immediately



followed these words by moving a procedure to business



and the appointment of committees.  Sundry marplots,



such as afflict all public bodies did, indeed, start to their



feet, but a universal cry of ``question'' drowned all their



efforts, and Mr. Raymond's motion was carried, to all



appearance unanimously.







Never was anything of the kind more effectual. 



Though most, if not all, the proceedings thus stated by



Mr. Raymond were fictions of his own imagination,



they served the purpose; his own resolution started the



whole machinery and set the convention prosperously on



its way.







The general opinion of the delegates clearly favored



the renomination of Mr. Lincoln.  It was an exhibition



not only of American common sense, but of sentiment. 



The American people and the public bodies which represent



them are indeed practical and materialistic to the



last degree, but those gravely err who ignore a very



different side of their character.  No people and no public



bodies are more capable of yielding to deep feeling.  So



it was now proven.  It was felt that not to renominate



Mr. Lincoln would be a sort of concession to the enemy. 



He had gained the confidence and indeed the love of



the entire Republican party.  There was a strong



conviction that, having suffered so much during the



terrible stress and strain of the war, he ought to be retained



as President after the glorious triumph of the Nation



which was felt to be approaching.







But in regard to the second place there was a different



feeling.  The Vice-President who had served with Mr.



Lincoln during his first term, Mr. Hamlin of Maine, was



a steadfast, staunch, and most worthy man, but it was



felt that the loyal element in the border States ought



to be recognized, and, therefore it was that, for the Vice-



Presidency was named a man who had begun life in the



lowest station, who had hardly learned to read until he



had become of age, who had always shown in Congress



the most bitter hatred of the slave barons of the South,



whom he considered as a caste above his own, but who



had distinguished himself, as a man, by high civic courage,



and as a senator by his determined speeches in behalf of



the Union.  This was Andrew Johnson of Tennessee, a



man honest, patriotic, but narrow and crabbed, who



turned out to be the most unfortunate choice ever made,



with the possible exception of John Tyler, twenty-four



years before.







The convention having adjourned, a large number of



delegates visited Washington, to pay their respects to the



President, and among them myself.  The city seemed



to me hardly less repulsive than at my first visit eight



years before; it was still unkempt and dirty,--made indeed



all the more so by the soldiery encamped about it,



and marching through it.







Shortly after our arrival our party, perhaps thirty in



number, went to the White House and were shown into



the great East Room.  We had been there for about ten



minutes when one of the doors nearest the street was



opened, and a young man entered who held the door



open for the admission of a tall, ungainly man dressed



in a rather dusty suit of black.  My first impression was



that this was some rural tourist who had blundered into the



place; for, really, he seemed less at home there than any



other person present, and looked about for an instant, as



if in doubt where he should go; but presently he turned



toward our group, which was near the southwestern corner



of the room, and then I saw that it was the President. 



As he came toward us in a sort of awkward, perfunctory



manner his face seemed to me one of the saddest I had



ever seen, and when he had reached us he held out his



hand to the first stranger, then to the second, and so on,



all with the air of a melancholy automaton.  But,



suddenly, some one in the company said something which



amused him, and instantly there came in his face a most



marvelous transformation.  I have never seen anything



like it in any other human being.  His features were



lighted, his eyes radiant, he responded to sundry remarks



humorously, though dryly, and thenceforward was cordial



and hearty.  Taking my hand in his he shook it in the



most friendly way, with a kindly word, and so passed



cheerily on to the others until the ceremony was finished.







Years afterward, noticing in the rooms of his son, Mr.



Robert Lincoln, our minister at London, a portrait of



his father, and seeing that it had the same melancholy



look noticeable in all President Lincoln's portraits, I



alluded to this change in his father's features, and asked



if any artist had ever caught the happier expression. 



Mr. Robert Lincoln answered that, so far as he knew, no



portrait of his father in this better mood had ever been



taken; that when any attempt was made to photograph



him or paint his portrait, he relapsed into his melancholy



mood, and that this is what has been transmitted to us by



all who have ever attempted to give us his likeness.







In the campaign which followed this visit to Washington



I tried to do my duty in speaking through my own



and adjacent districts, but there was little need of



speeches; the American people had made up their minds,



and they re<e:>lected Mr. Lincoln triumphantly.















CHAPTER VII







SENATORSHIP AT ALBANY--1865-1867







During my second year in the State Senate, 1865,



came the struggle for the charter of Cornell



University, the details of which will be given in another



chapter.







Two things during this session are forever stamped into



my memory.  The first was the news of Lee's surrender



on April 9, 1865: though it had been daily expected, it



came as a vast relief.







It was succeeded by a great sorrow.  On the morning



of April 15, 1865, coming down from my rooms in the



Delavan House at Albany, I met on the stairway a very



dear old friend, the late Charles Sedgwick, of Syracuse,



one of the earliest and most devoted of Republicans, who



had served with distinction in the House of Representatives,



and had more than once been widely spoken of



for the United States Senate.  Coming toward me with



tears in his eyes and voice, hardly able to speak, he



grasped me by the hand and gasped the words, ``Lincoln



is murdered.''  I could hardly believe myself awake: the



thing seemed impossible;--too wicked, too monstrous, too



cruel to be true; but alas! confirmation of the news came



speedily and the Presidency was in the hands of Andrew



Johnson.







Shortly afterward the body of the murdered President,



borne homeward to Illinois, rested overnight in the State



Capitol, and preparations were made for its reception.  I



was one of the bearers chosen by the Senate and was also



elected to pronounce one of the orations.  Rarely have I



felt an occasion so deeply: it has been my lot during my



life to be present at the funerals of various great rulers



and magnates; but at none of these was so deep an



impression made upon me as by the body of Lincoln lying



in the assembly chamber at Albany, quiet and peaceful at



last.







Of the speeches made in the Senate on the occasion,



mine being the only one which was not read or given from



memory, attracted some attention, and I was asked



especially for the source of a quotation which occurred in



it, and which was afterward dwelt upon by some of my



hearers.  It was the result of a sudden remembrance of the



lines in Milton's ``Samson Agonistes,'' beginning:







   ``Oh, how comely it is, and how reviving



     To the spirits of just men long oppressed,



     When God into the hands of their deliverer



     Puts invincible might



     To quell the mighty of the earth, the oppressor,



     The brute and boisterous force of violent men,'' etc.[2]











[2] Milton's ``Samson Agonistes,'' lines 1268-1280.















The funeral was conducted with dignity and solemnity. 



When the coffin was opened and we were allowed to take



one last look at Lincoln's face, it impressed me as having



the same melancholy expression which I had seen upon it



when he entered the East Room at the White House.  In



its quiet sadness there seemed to have been no change. 



There was no pomp in the surroundings; all, though dignified,



was simple.  Very different was it from the show



and ceremonial at the funeral of the Emperor Nicholas



which I had attended ten years before;--but it was even



more impressive.  At the head of the coffin stood General



Dix, who had served so honorably in the War of 1812, in



the Senate of the United States, in the Civil War, and who



was afterward to serve with no less fidelity as governor



of the State.  Nothing could be more fitting than such a



chieftaincy in the guard of honor.







In the following autumn the question of my renomination



came.







It had been my fortune to gain, first of all, the ill will



of Tammany Hall, and the arms of Tammany were long. 



Its power was exercised strongly through its henchmen



not only in the Democratic party throughout the State,



but especially in the Republican party, and, above all,



among sundry contractors of the Erie Canal, many of



whose bills I had opposed, and it was understood that



they and their friends were determined to defeat me.







Moreover, it was thought by some that I had mortally



offended sundry Catholic priests by opposing their plan



for acquiring Ward's Island, and that I had offended



various Protestant bodies, especially the Methodists, by



defeating their efforts to divide up the Land Grant



Fund between some twenty petty sectarian colleges, and



by exerting myself to secure it for Cornell University,



which, because it was unsectarian, many called ``godless.''







Though I made speeches through the district as formerly,



I asked no pledges of any person, but when the nominating



convention assembled I was renominated in spite



of all opposition, and triumphantly:--a gifted and honorable



man, the late David J. Mitchell, throwing himself



heartily into the matter, and in an eloquent speech



absolutely silencing the whole Tammany and canal



combination.  He was the most successful lawyer in the



district before juries, and never did his best qualities



show themselves more fully than on this occasion. 



My majority on the first ballot was overwhelming, the



nomination was immediately made unanimous, and at the



election I had the full vote.







Arriving in Albany at the beginning of my third year



of service--1866--I found myself the only member of the



committee appointed to investigate matters in the city of



New York who had been re<e:>lected.  Under these circumstances



no report from the committee was possible; but



the committee on municipal affairs, having brought in a



bill to legislate out of office the city inspector and all his



associates, and to put in a new and thoroughly qualified



health board, I made a carefully prepared speech, which



took the character of a report.  The facts which I



brought out were sufficient to condemn the whole existing



system twenty times over.  By testimony taken under oath



the monstrosities of the existing system were fully revealed,



as well as the wretched character of the ``health



officers,'' ``inspectors,'' and the whole army of underlings,



and I exhibited statistics carefully ascertained and tabulated,



showing the absurd disproportion of various classes



of officials to each other, their appointment being made,



not to preserve the public health, but to carry the ward



caucuses and elections.  During this exposure Boole, the



head of the whole system, stood not far from me on the



floor, his eyes fastened upon me, with an expression in



which there seemed to mingle fear, hatred, and something



else which I could hardly divine.  His face seemed to me,



even then, the face of a madman.  So it turned out.  The



new bill drove him out of office, and, in a short time, into



a madhouse.







I have always thought upon the fate of this man with a



sort of sadness.  Doubtless in his private relations he



had good qualities, but to no public service that I have



ever been able to render can I look back with a stronger



feeling that my work was good.  It unquestionably resulted



in saving the lives of hundreds, nay thousands, of



men, women, and children; and yet it is a simple fact that



had I, at any time within a year or two afterward, visited



those parts of the city of New York which I had thus



benefited, and been recognized by the dwellers in the tenement



houses as the man who had opposed their dramshop-



keepers and brought in a new health board, those very



people whose lives and the lives of whose children I had



thus saved would have mobbed me, and, if possible, would



have murdered me.







Shortly after the close of the session I was invited to



give the Phi Beta Kappa address at the Yale commencement,



and as the question of the reconstruction of the



Union at the close of the war was then the most important



subject before the country, and as it seemed to me



best to strike while the iron was hot, my subject was



``The Greatest Foe of Republics.''  The fundamental



idea was that the greatest foe of modern states, and



especially of republics, is a political caste supported by



rights and privileges.  The treatment was mainly historical,



one of the main illustrations being drawn from the



mistake made by Richelieu in France, who, when he had



completely broken down such a caste, failed to destroy its



privileges, and so left a body whose oppressions and



assumptions finally brought on the French Revolution. 



Though I did not draw the inference, I presume that my



auditors drew it easily: it was simply that now, when the



slave power in the Union was broken down, it should not



be allowed to retain the power which had cost the country



so dear.







The address was well received, and two days later there



came to me what, under other circumstances, I would have



most gladly accepted, the election to a professorship at



Yale, which embraced the history of art and the direction



of the newly founded Street School of Art.  The thought



of me for the place no doubt grew out of the fact that,



during my stay in college, I had shown an interest in art,



and especially in architecture, and that after my return



from Europe I had delivered in the Yale chapel an address



on ``Cathedral Builders and Mediaeval Sculptors''



which was widely quoted.







It was with a pang that I turned from this offer.  To all



appearance, then and now, my life would have been far



happier in such a professorship, but to accept it was



clearly impossible.  The manner in which it was tendered



me seemed to me almost a greater honor than the professorship



itself.  I was called upon by a committee of the



governing body of the university, composed of the man



whom of all in New Haven I most revered, Dr. Bacon,



and the governor of the State, my old friend Joseph R.



Hawley, who read to me the resolution of the governing



body and requested my acceptance of the election. 



Nothing has ever been tendered me which I have felt to be a



greater honor.







A month later, on the 28th of August, 1866, began at



Albany what has been very rare in the history of New



York, a special session of the State Senate:--in a sense,



a court of impeachment.







Its purpose was to try the county judge of Oneida for



complicity in certain illegal proceedings regarding bounties. 



``Bounty jumping'' had become a very serious evil,



and it was claimed that this judicial personage had connived



at it.







I must confess that, as the evidence was developed, my



feelings as a man and my duties as a sworn officer of



the State were sadly at variance.  It came out that this



judge was endeavoring to support, on the wretched salary



of $1800 a year allowed by the county, not only



his own family, but also the family of his brother, who, if



I remember rightly, had lost his life during the war, and



it seemed to me a great pity that, as a penalty upon the



people of the county, he could not be quartered upon them



as long as he lived.  For they were the more culpable



criminals.  Belonging to one of the richest divisions of



the State, with vast interests at stake, they had not been



ashamed to pay a judge this contemptible pittance, and



they deserved to have their law badly administered.  This



feeling was undoubtedly wide-spread in the Senate; but,



on the other hand, there was the duty we were sworn to



perform, and the result was that the judge was removed



from office.







During this special session of the State Senate it was



entangled in a curious episode of national history.  The



new President, Mr. Andrew Johnson, had been induced to



take an excursion into the north and especially into the



State of New York.  He was accompanied by Mr. Seward,



the Secretary of State; General Grant, with his laurels



fresh from the Civil War; Admiral Farragut, who had



so greatly distinguished himself during the same epoch,



and others of great merit.  It was clear that Secretary



Seward thought that he could establish the popularity of



the new administration in the State of New York by



means of his own personal influence; but this proved the



greatest mistake of his life.







On the arrival of the presidential party in New York



City, various elements there joined in a showy reception



to them, and all were happy.  But the scene soon changed. 



From the city Mr. Seward, with the President, his



associates, and a large body of citizens more or less



distinguished, came up the Hudson River in one of the finest



steamers, a great banquet being given on board.  But on



approaching Albany, Mr. Seward began to discover his



mistake; for the testimonials of admiration and respect



toward the President grew less and less hearty as the party



moved northward.  This was told me afterward by Mr.



Thurlow Weed, Mr. Seward's lifelong friend, and probably



the most competent judge of such matters in the



United States.  At various places where the President



was called out to speak, he showed a bitterness toward



those who opposed his policy which more and more



displeased his audiences.  One pet phrase of his soon excited



derision.  The party were taking a sort of circular tour,



going northward by the eastern railway and steamer lines,



turning westward at Albany, and returning by western



lines; hence the President, in one of his earlier speeches,



alluded to his journey as ``swinging round the circle.'' 



The phrase seemed to please him, and he constantly



repeated it in his speeches, so that at last the whole matter



was referred to by the people at large, contemptuously, as



``swinging round the circle,'' reference being thereby



made, not merely to the President's circular journey, but



to the alleged veering of his opinions from those he professed



when elected.







As soon as the State Senate was informed of the probable



time when the party would arrive at Albany, a resolution



was introduced which welcomed in terms:  ``The



President of the United States, Andrew Johnson; the



Secretary of State, William H. Seward; the General of



the Army, Ulysses S. Grant; and the Admiral of the Navy,



David G. Farragut.''  The feeling against President Johnson



and his principal adviser, Mr. Seward, on account of



the break which had taken place between them and the



majority of the Republican party, was immediately evident,



for it was at once voiced by amending the resolution



so that it left out all names, and merely tendered a



respectful welcome, in terms, to ``The President of the



United States, the Secretary of State, the General of the



Army, and the Admiral of the Navy.''  But suddenly came



up a second amendment which was little if anything short



of an insult to the President and Secretary.  It extended



the respectful welcome, in terms, to ``The President of



the United States; to the Secretary of State; to Ulysses



S. Grant, General of the Army; and to David G. Farragut,



Admiral of the Navy''; thus making the first part, relating



to the President and the Secretary of State, merely



a mark of respect for the offices they held, and the latter



part a tribute to Grant and Farragut, not only official,



but personal.  Most earnest efforts were made to defeat



the resolution in this form.  It was pathetic to see old



Republicans who had been brought up to worship Mr.



Seward plead with their associates not to put so gross



an insult upon a man who had rendered such services



to the Republican party, to the State, and to the Nation. 



All in vain!  In spite of all our opposition, the resolution,



as amended in this latter form, was carried, indicating



the clear purpose of the State Senate to honor



simply and solely the offices of the President and of the



Secretary of State, but just as distinctly to honor the



persons of the General of the Army and the Admiral of



the Navy.







On the arrival of the party in Albany they came up to



the State House, and were received under the portico



by Governor Fenton and his staff.  It was perfectly



understood that Governor Fenton, though a Republican,



was in sympathy with the party in the Senate which had



put this slight upon the President and Secretary of State



and Mr. Seward's action was characteristic.  Having



returned a curt and dry reply to the guarded phrases of the



governor, he pressed by him with the President and his



associates to the ``Executive Chamber'' near the entrance,



the way to which he, of all men, well knew.  In that room



the Senate were assembled and, on the entrance of the



visitors, Governor Fenton endeavored to introduce them



in a formal speech; but Mr. Seward was too prompt for



him; he took the words out of the governor's mouth and



said, in a way which thrilled all of us who had been



brought up to love and admire him, ``In the Executive



Chamber of the State of New York I surely need no



introduction.  I bring to you the President of the United



States; the chief magistrate who is restoring peace and



prosperity to our country.''







The whole scene impressed me greatly; there rushed



upon me a strong tide of recollection as I contrasted what



Governor Fenton had been and was, with what Governor



Seward had been and was: it all seemed to me a ghastly



mistake.  There stood Fenton, marking the lowest point



in the choice of a State executive ever reached in our



Commonwealth by the Republican party: there stood



Seward who, from his boyhood in college, had fought



courageously, steadily, powerfully, and at last triumphantly,



against the domination of slavery; who, as State



senator, as governor, as the main founder of the Republican



party, as senator of the United States and finally as



Secretary of State, had rendered service absolutely



inestimable; who for years had braved storms of calumny



and ridicule and finally the knife of an assassin; and who



was now adhering to Andrew Johnson simply because he



knew that if he let go his hold, the President would relapse



into the hands of men opposed to any rational settlement



of the questions between the North and South.  I



noticed on Seward's brow the deep scar made by the



assassin's knife when Lincoln was murdered; all the



others, greatly as I admired Grant and Farragut, passed



with me at that time for nothing; my eyes were fixed upon



the Secretary of State.







After all was over I came out with my colleague, Judge



Folger, and as we left the Capitol he said:  ``What was



the matter with you in the governor's room?'' I answered: 



``Nothing was the matter with me; what do you



mean?''  He said:  ``The moment Seward began to speak



you fastened your eyes intently upon him, you turned so



pale that I thought you were about to drop, and I made



ready to seize you and prevent your falling.''  I then



confessed to him the feeling which was doubtless the cause



of this change of countenance.







As one who cherishes a deep affection for my native



State and for men who have made it great, I may be



allowed here to express the hope that the day will come



when it will redeem itself from the just charge of



ingratitude, and do itself honor by honoring its two greatest



governors, De Witt Clinton and William H. Seward.  No



statue of either of them stands at Albany, the place of all



others where such memorials should be erected, not



merely as an honor to the two statesmen concerned, but as



a lesson to the citizens of the State;--pointing out the



qualities which ought to ensure public gratitude, but



which, thus far, democracies have least admired.



















CHAPTER VIII







ROSCOE CONKLING AND JUDGE FOLGER--1867-1868







At the beginning of my fourth year at Albany, in



1867, came an election to the Senate of the United



States.  Of the two senators then representing the State,



one, Edwin D. Morgan, had been governor, and combined



the qualities of a merchant prince and of a shrewd politician;



the other, Ira Harris, had been a highly respected



judge, and was, from every point of view, a most worthy



man: but unfortunately neither of these gentlemen seemed



to exercise any adequate influence in solving the main



questions then before Congress.







No more important subjects have ever come before that



body than those which arose during the early years of



the Civil War, and it was deeply felt throughout the State



that neither of the senators fitly uttered its voice or



exercised its influence.







Mr. Cornell, with whom I had then become intimate, was



never censorious; rarely did he say anything in disapproval



of any man; he was charitable in his judgments, and



generally preferred to be silent rather than severe; but I



remember that on his return from a stay in Washington,



he said to me indignantly:  ``While at the Capitol



I was ashamed of the State of New York: one great question



after another came up; bills of the highest importance



were presented and discussed by senators from Ohio,



Vermont, Missouri, Indiana, Iowa, and the rest; but from



New York never a word!''







The question now was, who should succeed Senator



Harris?  He naturally desired a second term, and it would



have given me pleasure to support him, for he was an old



and honored friend of my father and mother, they having



been, in their early life, his neighbors and schoolmates,



and their friendship having descended to me; but like



others I was disappointed that Senator Harris had not



taken a position more fitting.  His main efforts seemed to



be in the line of friendly acts for his constituents.  In so



far as these were done for soldiers in the army they were



praiseworthy; though it was generally felt that while arising



primarily from a natural feeling of benevolence, they



were mainly devoted to securing a body of friends



throughout the State, who would support him when the



time should come for his re<e:>lection.  Apparently with the



same object, he was a most devoted supporter of New



York office-seekers of all sorts.  He had pleasing personal



characteristics, but it was reported that Mr. Lincoln,



referring to the senator's persistency in pressing candidates



for office, once said:  ``I never think of going to sleep now



without first looking under my bed to see if Judge Harris



is not there wanting something for somebody.''







Another candidate was Judge Noah Davis, then of



Lockport, also a man of high character, of excellent legal



abilities, a good speaker, and one who, had he been elected,



would have done honor to the State.  But on looking about



I discovered, as I thought, a better candidate.  Judge



Bailey, of Oneida County, had called my attention to the



claims of Mr. Roscoe Conkling, then a member of Congress



from the Oneida district, who had distinguished



himself as an effective speaker, a successful lawyer, and



an honest public servant.  He had, to be sure, run foul of



Mr. Blaine of Maine, and had received, in return for what



Mr. Blaine considered a display of offensive manners, a



very serious oratorical castigation; but he had just fought



a good fight which had drawn the attention of the whole



State to him.  A coalition having been formed between the



anti-war Democrats and a number of disaffected Republicans



in his district to defeat his re<e:>lection to Congress, it



had seemed likely to overwhelm him and drive him out of



public life, and one thing seemed for a time likely to prove



fatal to him:--the ``New York Tribune,'' the great organ



of the party, edited by Horace Greeley, gave him no effective



support.  But the reason was apparent later when it



became known that Mr. Greeley was to be a candidate



for the senatorship, and it was evidently felt that should



Mr. Conkling triumph in such a struggle, he would be a



very serious competitor.  The young statesman had shown



himself equal to the emergency.  He had fought his battle



without the aid of Mr. Greeley and the ``Tribune,'' and



won it, and, as a result, had begun to be thought of as a



promising candidate for the United States senatorship.  I



had never spoken with him; had hardly seen him; but



I had watched his course closely, and one thing especially



wrought powerfully with me in his favor.  The men who



had opposed him were of the same sort with those who had



opposed me, and as I was proud of their opposition, I



felt that he had a right to be so.  The whole force of



Tammany henchmen and canal contractors throughout



the State honored us both with their enmity.







It was arranged among Mr. Conkling's supporters that,



at the great caucus which was to decide the matter, Mr.



Conkling's name should be presented by the member of



the assembly representing his district, Ellis Roberts, a



man of eminent character and ability, who, having begun



by taking high rank as a scholar at Yale, had become one



of the foremost editors of the State, and had afterward



distinguished himself not only in the State legislature, but



in Congress, and as the head of the independent treasury



in the city of New York.  The next question was as to the



speech seconding the nomination.  It was proposed that



Judge Folger should make it, but as he showed a curious



diffidence in the matter, and preferred to preside over the



caucus, the duty was tendered to me.







At the hour appointed the assembly hall of the old Capitol



was full; floor and galleries were crowded to suffocation. 



The candidates were duly presented, and, among



them, Mr. Conkling by Mr. Roberts.  I delayed my speech



somewhat.  The general course of it had been thought out



beforehand, but the phraseology and sequence of argument



were left to the occasion.  I felt deeply the importance



of nominating Mr. Conkling, and when the moment came



threw my heart into it.  I was in full health and vigor, and



soon felt that a very large part of the audience was with





me.  Presently I used the argument that the great State



of New York, which had been so long silent in the highest



councils of the Nation, demanded A VOICE.  Instantly the



vast majority of all present, in the galleries, in the lobbies,



and on the floor, rose in quick response to the sentiment



and cheered with all their might.  There had been no such



outburst in the whole course of the evening.  Evidently



this was the responsive chord, and having gone on with



the main line of my argument, I at last closed with the



same declaration in different form;--that our great



Commonwealth,--the most important in the whole sisterhood



of States,--which had been so long silent in the Senate,



WISHED TO BE HEARD, and that, therefore, I seconded the



nomination of Mr. Conkling.  Immediately the whole



house rose to this sentiment again and again, with even



greater evidence of approval than before; the voting began



and Mr. Conkling was finally nominated, if my memory



is correct, by a majority of three.







The moment the vote was declared the whole assembly



broke loose; the pressure being removed, there came a



general effervescence of good feeling, and I suddenly



found myself raised on the shoulders of stalwart men who



stood near, and rapidly carried over the heads of the



crowd, through many passages and corridors, my main



anxiety being to protect my head so that my brains might



not be knocked out against stairways and doorways;



but presently, when fairly dazed and bewildered, I was



borne into a room in the old Congress Hall Hotel, and



deposited safely in the presence of a gentleman standing



with his back to the fire, who at once extended his hand



to me most cordially, and to whom I said, ``God bless



you, Senator Conkling.  ``A most hearty response



followed, and so began my closer acquaintance with the



new senator.







Mr. Conkling's election followed as a thing of course,



and throughout the State there was general approval.







During this session of 1867 I found myself involved in



two rather curious struggles, and with no less a personage



than my colleague, Judge Folger.







As to the first of these I had long felt, and still feel, that



of all the weaknesses in our institutions, one of the most



serious is our laxity in the administration of the criminal



law.  No other civilized country, save possibly the lower



parts of Italy and Sicily, shows anything to approach the



number of unpunished homicides, in proportion to the



population, which are committed in sundry parts of our



own country, and indeed in our country taken as a whole. 



In no country is the deterrent effect of punishment so



vitiated by delay; in no country is so much facility given



to chicanery, to futile appeals, and to every possible means



of clearing men from the due penalty of high crime, and



especially the crime of murder.







It was in view of this fact that, acting on the advice of an



old and able judge whose experience in criminal practice



had been very large, I introduced into the Senate a



bill to improve the procedure in criminal cases.  The



judge just referred to had shown me the absurdities



arising from the fact that testimony in regard to character,



even in the case of professional criminals, was not



allowed save in rebuttal.  It was notorious that professional



criminals charged with high crimes, especially in



our large cities, frequently went free because, while the



testimony to the particular crime was not absolutely



overwhelming, testimony to their character as professional



criminals, which, in connection with the facts established,



would have been absolutely conclusive, could not be admitted. 



I therefore proposed that testimony as to character



in any criminal case might be introduced by the



prosecution if, after having been privately submitted to



the judge, he should decide that the ends of justice would



be furthered thereby.







The bill was referred to the Senate judiciary committee,



of which Judge Folger was chairman.  After it had lain



there some weeks and the judge had rather curtly answered



my questions as to when it would be reported, it



became clear to me that the committee had no intention of



reporting it at all, whereupon I introduced a resolution



requesting them to report it, at the earliest day possible,



for the consideration of the Senate, and this was passed



in spite of the opposition of the committee.  Many days



then passed; no report was made, and I therefore introduced



a resolution taking the bill out of the hands of the



committee and bringing it directly before the committee



of the whole.  This was most earnestly resisted by Judge



Folger and by his main associate on the committee, Henry



Murphy of Brooklyn.  On the other hand I had, to aid me,



Judge Lowe, also a lawyer of high standing, and indeed



all the lawyers in the body who were not upon the judiciary



committee.  The result was that my motion was



successful; the bill was taken from the committee and



immediately brought under discussion.







In reply to the adverse arguments of Judge Folger and



Mr. Murphy, which were to the effect that my bill was an



innovation upon the criminal law of the State, I pointed



out the fact that evidence as to the character of the person



charged with crime is often all-important; that in our



daily life we act upon that fact as the simplest dictate of



common sense; that if any senator present had his watch



stolen from his room he would be very slow to charge the



crime against the servant who was last seen in the room,



even under very suspicious circumstances; but if he found



that the servant had been discharged for theft from various



places previously, this would be more important than



any other circumstance.  I showed how safeguards which



had been devised in the middle ages to protect citizens



from the feudal lord were now used to aid criminals in



evading the law, and I ended by rather unjustly compar-



ing Judge Folger to the great Lord Chancellor Eldon, of



whom it was said that, despite his profound knowledge



of the law, ``no man ever did so much good as he



prevented.''  The result was that the bill was passed by the



Senate in spite of the judiciary committee.







During the continuance of the discussion Judge Folger



had remained in his usual seat, but immediately after the



passage of the bill he resumed his place as president of the



Senate.  He was evidently vexed, and in declaring the



Senate adjourned he brought the gavel down with a sort



of fling which caused it to fly out of his hand and fall in



front of his desk on the floor.  Fortunately it was after



midnight and few saw it; but there was a general feeling



of regret among us all that a man so highly respected



should have so lost his temper.  By common consent the



whole matter was hushed; no mention of it, so far as I



could learn, was made in the public press, and soon all



seemed forgotten.







Unfortunately it was remembered, and in a quarter



which brought upon Judge Folger one of the worst



disappointments of his life.







For, in the course of the following summer, the Constitutional



Convention of the State was to hold its session and



its presidency was justly considered a great honor.  Two



candidates were named, one being Judge Folger and the



other Mr. William A. Wheeler, then a member of Congress



and afterward Vice-President of the United States.  The



result of the canvas by the friends of both these gentlemen



seemed doubtful, when one morning there appeared in the



``New York Tribune,'' the most powerful organ of the



Republican party, one of Horace Greeley's most trenchant



articles.  It dwelt on the importance of the convention



in the history of the State, on the responsibility of its



members, on the characteristics which should mark its



presiding officer, and, as to this latter point, wound up



pungently by saying that it would be best to have a president



who, when he disagreed with members, did not throw



his gavel at them.  This shot took effect; it ran through



the State; people asked the meaning of it; various exaggerated



legends became current, one of them being that he



had thrown the gavel at me personally;--and Mr. Wheeler



became president of the convention.







But before the close of the session another matter had



come up which cooled still more the relations between



Judge Folger and myself.  For many sessions, year after



year, there had been before the legislature a bill for



establishing a canal connecting the interior lake system of the



State with Lake Ontario.  This was known as the Sodus



Canal Bill, and its main champion was a public-spirited



man from Judge Folger's own district.  In favor of the



canal various arguments were urged, one of them being



that it would enable the United States, while keeping



within its treaty obligations with Great Britain, to build



ships on these smaller lakes, which, in case of need, could



be passed through the canal into the great chain of lakes



extending from Lake Ontario to Lake Superior.  To this



it was replied that such an evasion of the treaty was not



especially creditable to those suggesting it, and that the



main purpose of the bill really was to create a vast water



power which should enure to the benefit of sundry gentlemen



in Judge Folger's district.







Up to this time Judge Folger seemed never to care



much for the bill, and I had never made any especial effort



against it; but when, just at the close of the session,



certain constituents of mine upon the Oswego River had



shown me that there was great danger in the proposed



canal to the water supply through the counties of Onondaga



and Oswego, I opposed the measure.  Thereupon



Judge Folger became more and more earnest in its favor,



and it soon became evident that all his power would be



used to pass it during the few remaining days of the



session.  By his influence it was pushed rapidly through



all its earlier stages, and at last came up before the



Senate.  It seemed sure to pass within ten minutes, when I



moved that the whole matter be referred to the approaching



Constitutional Convention, which was to begin its sessions



immediately after the adjournment of the legislature,



and Judge Folger having spoken against this motion, I



spoke in its favor and did what I have never done before



in my life and probably shall never do again--spoke



against time.  There was no ``previous question'' in the



Senate, no limitation as to the period during which a



member could discuss any measure, and, as the youngest



member in the body, I was in the full flush of youthful



strength.  I therefore announced my intention to present



some three hundred arguments in favor of referring the



whole matter to the State Constitutional Convention, those



arguments being based upon the especial fitness of its



three hundred members to decide the question, as shown



by the personal character and life history of each and



every one of them.  I then went on with this series of



biographies, beginning with that of Judge Folger himself,



and paying him most heartily and cordially every



tribute possible, including some of a humorous nature. 



Having given about half an hour to the judge, I then took



up sundry other members and kept on through the entire



morning.  I had the floor and no one could dispossess me. 



The lieutenant-governor, in the chair, General Stewart



Woodford, was perfectly just and fair, and although



Judge Folger and Mr. Murphy used all their legal acuteness



in devising some means of evading the rules, they



were in every case declared by the lieutenant-governor to



be out of order, and the floor was in every case reassigned



to me.  Meantime, the whole Senate, though anxious to



adjourn, entered into the spirit of the matter, various



members passing me up biographical notes on the members



of the convention, some of them very comical, and



presently the hall was crowded with members of the



assembly as well as senators, all cheering me on.  The



reason for this was very simple.  There had come to be



a general understanding of the case, namely, that Judge



Folger, by virtue of his great power and influence, was



trying in the last hours of the session to force through a



bill for the benefit of his district, and that I was simply



doing my best to prevent an injustice.  The result was



that I went on hour after hour with my series of biographies,



until at last Judge Folger himself sent me word



that if I would desist and allow the legislature to adjourn



he would make no further effort to carry the bill at that



session.  To this I instantly agreed; the bill was dropped



for that session and for all sessions: so far as I can learn



it has never reappeared.







Shortly after our final adjournment the Constitutional



Convention came together.  It was one of the best bodies



of the kind ever assembled in any State, as a list of its



members abundantly shows.  There was much work for



it, and most important of all was the reorganization of



the highest judicial body in the State--the Court of



Appeals--which had become hopelessly inadequate.







The two principal members of the convention from the



city of New York were Horace Greeley, editor of the



``Tribune,'' and William M. Evarts, afterward Attorney-



General, United States senator, and Secretary of State of



the United States.  Mr. Greeley was at first all-powerful. 



As has already been seen, he had been able to prevent



Judge Folger taking the presidency of the convention,



and for a few days he had everything his own way.  But



he soon proved so erratic a leader that his influence was



completely lost, and after a few sessions there was hardly



any member with less real power to influence the judgments



of his colleagues.







This was not for want of real ability in his speeches,



for at various times I heard him make, for and against



measures, arguments admirably pungent, forcible, and



far-reaching, but there seemed to be a universal feeling



that he was an unsafe guide.







Soon came a feature in his course which made matters



worse.  The members of the convention, many of them,



were men in large business and very anxious to have a



day or two each week for their own affairs.  Moreover,



during the first weeks of the session, while the main



matters coming before the convention were still in the hands



of committees, there was really not enough business ready



for the convention to occupy it through all the days of the



week, and consequently it adopted the plan, for the first



weeks at least, of adjourning from Friday night till Tuesday



morning.  This vexed Mr. Greeley sorely.  He insisted



that the convention ought to keep at its business



and finish it without any such weekly adjournments, and,



as his arguments to this effect did not prevail in the



convention, he began making them through the ``Tribune''



before the people of the State.  Soon his arguments



became acrid, and began undermining the convention at



every point.







As to Mr. Greeley's feeling regarding the weekly



adjournment, one curious thing was reported:  There was



a member from New York of a literary turn for whom the



great editor had done much in bringing his verses and



other productions before the public--a certain Mr. Duganne;



but it happened that, on one of the weekly motions



to adjourn, Mr. Duganne had voted in the affirmative, and,



as a result, Mr. Greeley, meeting him just afterward,



upbraided him in a manner which filled the rural bystanders



with consternation.  It was well known to those best



acquainted with the editor of the ``Tribune'' that, when



excited, he at times indulged in the most ingenious and



picturesque expletives, and some of Mr. Chauncey Depew's



best stories of that period pointed to this fact.  On this



occasion Mr. Greeley really outdid himself, and the



result was that the country members, who up to that



time had regarded him with awe as the representative of



the highest possible morality in public and private life,



were greatly dismayed, and in various parts of the room



they were heard expressing their amazement, and saying



to each other in awe-stricken tones:  ``Why! Greeley



swears!''







Ere long Mr. Greeley was taking, almost daily in the



``Tribune,'' steady ground against the doings of his



colleagues.  Lesser newspapers followed with no end of



cheap and easy denunciation, and the result was that the



convention became thoroughly, though unjustly, discredited



throughout the State, and indeed throughout the



country.  A curious proof of this met me.  Being at



Cambridge, Massachusetts, I passed an evening with Governor



Washburn, one of the most thoughtful and valuable



public men of that period.  In the course of our conversation



he said:  ``Mr. White, it is really sad to hear of the



doings at your Albany convention.  I can remember your



constitutional convention of 1846, and when I compare



this convention with that, it grieves me.''  My answer



was:  ``Governor Washburn, you are utterly mistaken:



there has never been a constitutional convention in the



State of New York, not even that you name, which has



contained so many men of the highest ability and character



as the one now in session, and none which has really



done better work.  I am not a member of the body and



can say this in its behalf.''  At this he expressed his



amazement, and pointed to the ``Tribune'' in confirmation



of his own position.  I then stated the case to him, and, I



think, alleviated his distress.







But as the sessions of the convention drew to a close and



the value of its work began to be clearly understood,



Greeley's nobler qualities, his real truthfulness and public



spirit began to assert themselves, and more than once he



showed practical shrewdness and insight.  Going into



convention one morning, I found the question under



discussion to be the election of the secretary of state,



attorney-general, and others of the governor's cabinet, whose



appointment under the older constitutions was wisely



left to the governor, but who, for twenty years, had



been elected by the people.  There was a wide-spread feeling



that the old system was wiser, and that the new had



by no means justified itself; in fact, that by fastening on



the governor the responsibility for his cabinet, the State



is likely to secure better men than when their choice is



left to the hurly-burly of intrigue and prejudice in a



nominating convention.







The main argument made by those who opposed such a



return to the old, better order of things was that the



people would not like it and would be inclined to vote



down the new constitution on account of it.







In reply to this, Mr. Greeley arose and made a most



admirable short speech ending with these words, given in



his rapid falsetto, with a sort of snap that made the whole



seem like one word:  ``When-the-people-take-up-their-



ballots-they-want-to-see-who-is-to-be-governor: that's-all-



they-care-about: they-don't-want-to-read-a-whole-chapter-



of-the-Bible-on-their-ballots.''







Unfortunately, the majority dared not risk the popular



ratification of the new constitution, and so this amendment



was lost.







No doubt Mr. Greeley was mainly responsible for this



condition of things; his impatience with the convention, as



shown by his articles in the ``Tribune,'' had been caught



by the people of the State.







The long discussions were very irksome to him, and one



day I mildly expostulated with him on account of some



of his utterances against the much speaking of his colleagues,



and said:  ``After all, Mr. Greeley, is n't it a pretty



good thing to have a lot of the best men in the State come



together every twenty years and thoroughly discuss the



whole constitution, to see what improvements can be



made; and is not the familiarity with the constitution and



interest in it thus aroused among the people at large worth



all the fatigue arising from long speeches?''  ``Well,



perhaps so,'' he said, but he immediately began to grumble



and finally to storm in a comical way against some of his



colleagues who, it must be confessed, were tiresome.  Still



he became interested more and more in the work, and as



the new constitution emerged from the committees and



public debates, he evidently saw that it was a great gain



to the State, and now did his best through the ``Tribune''



to undo what he had been doing.  He wrote editorials



praising the work of the convention and urging that it be



adopted.  But all in vain: the unfavorable impression had



been too widely and deeply made, and the result was that



the new constitution, when submitted to the people, was



ignominiously voted down, and the whole summer's work



of the convention went for nothing.  Later, however, a



portion of it was rescued and put into force through the



agency of a ``Constitutional Commission,'' a small body



of first-rate men who sat at Albany, and whose main



conclusions were finally adopted in the shape of amendments



to the old constitution.  There was, none the less, a



wretched loss to the State.







During the summer of 1867 I was completely immersed



in the duties of my new position at Cornell University;



going through various institutions in New England and



the Western States to note the workings of their technical



departments; visiting Ithaca to consult with Mr. Cornell



and to look over plans for buildings, and credentials for



professorships, or, shut up in my own study at Syracuse,



or in the cabins of Cayuga Lake steamers, drawing up



schemes of university organization, so that my political



life soon seemed ages behind me.







While on a visit to Harvard, I was invited by Agassiz



to pass a day with him at Nahant in order to discuss



methods and men.  He entered into the matter very



earnestly, agreed to give us an extended course of



lectures, which he afterward did, and aided us in many



ways.  One remark of his surprised me.  I had asked him



to name men, and he had taken much pains to do so, when



suddenly he turned to me abruptly and said:  ``Who is to



be your professor of moral philosophy?  That is by far



the most important matter in your whole organization.'' 



It seemed strange that one who had been honored by the



whole world as probably the foremost man in natural



science then living, and who had been denounced by many



exceedingly orthodox people as an enemy of religion,



should take this view of the new faculty, but it showed



how deeply and sincerely religious he was.  I soon



reassured him on the point he had raised, and then went on



with the discussion of scientific men, methods, and equipments.







I was also asked by the poet Longfellow to pass a day



with him at his beautiful Nahant cottage in order to discuss



certain candidates and methods in literature.  Nothing



could be more delightful than his talk as we sat



together on the veranda looking out over the sea, with the



gilded dome of the State House, which he pointed out to



me as ``The Hub,'' in the dim distance.  One question of



his amused me much.  We were discussing certain recent



events in which Mr. Horace Greeley had played an



important part, and after alluding to Mr. Greeley's course



during the War, he turned his eyes fully but mildly



upon me and said slowly and solemnly:  ``Mr. White, don't



you think Mr. Greeley a very useless sort of man?''  The



question struck me at first as exceedingly comical; for, I



thought, ``Imagine Mr. Greeley, who thinks himself, and



with reason, a useful man if there ever was one, and whose



whole life has been devoted to what he has thought of the



highest and most direct use to his fellow-men, hearing this



question put in a dreamy way by a poet,--a writer of



verse,--probably the last man in America whom Mr.



Greeley would consider `useful.' ''  But my old admiration



for the great editor came back in a strong tide, and if I



was ever eloquent it was in showing Mr. Longfellow how



great, how real, how sincere, and in the highest degree



how useful Mr. Greeley had been.







Another man of note whom I met in those days was



Judge Rockwood Hoar, afterward named by General



Grant Attorney-General of the United States, noted as a



profound lawyer of pungent wit and charming humor, the



delight of his friends and the terror of his enemies.  I



saw him first at Harvard during a competition for the



Boylston prize at which we were fellow-judges.  All the



speaking was good, some of it admirable; but the especially



remarkable pieces were two.  First of these was a



recital of Washington Irving's ``Broken Heart,'' by an



undergraduate from the British provinces, Robert Alder



McLeod.  Nothing could be more simple and perfect in its



way; nothing more free from any effort at orating; all



was in the most quiet and natural manner possible.  The



second piece was a rendering of Poe's ``Bells,'' and was



a most amazing declamation, the different sorts of bells



being indicated by changes of voice ranging from basso



profondo to the highest falsetto, and the feelings aroused



in the orator being indicated by modulations which must



have cost him months of practice.







The contest being ended, and the committee having



retired to make their award, various members expressed an



opinion in favor of Mr. McLeod's quiet recital, when



Judge Hoar, who had seemed up to that moment immersed



in thought, seemed suddenly to awake, and said:  ``If I



had a son who spoke that bell piece in that style I believe



I'd choke him.''  The vote was unanimously in favor of



Mr. McLeod, and then came out a curious fact.  Having



noticed that he bore an empty sleeve, I learned from



Professor Peabody that he had lost his arm while fighting on



the Confederate side in our Civil War, and that he was a



man of remarkably fine scholarship and noble character. 



He afterward became an instructor at Harvard, but died



early.







During the following autumn, in spite of my absorption



in university interests, I was elected a delegate to the State



Convention, and in October made a few political speeches,



the most important being at Clinton, the site of Hamilton



College.  This was done at the special request of Senator



Conkling, and on my way I passed a day with him at



Utica, taking a long drive through the adjacent country. 



Never was he more charming.  The bitter and sarcastic



mood seemed to have dropped off him; the overbearing



manner had left no traces; he was full of delightful



reminiscences and it was a day to be remembered.







I also spoke at various other places and, last of all, at



Clifton Springs, but received there a rebuff which was not



without its uses.







I had thought my speeches successful; but at the latter



place, taking the cars next morning, I heard a dialogue



between two railway employees, as follows:







``Bill, did you go to the meetin' last night?''  ``Yes.''



``How was it?''  ``It wa'n't no meetin', leastwise no P'LITICAL



meetin'; there wa'n't nothin' in it fur the boys; it was



only one of them scientific college purfessors lecturin'.'' 



And so I sped homeward, pondering on many things, but



strengthened, by this homely criticism, in my determination



to give my efforts henceforth to the new university.















CHAPTER IX







GENERAL GRANT AND SANTO DOMINGO--1868-1871











During the two or three years following my senatorial



term, work in the founding and building of Cornell



University was so engrossing that there was little



time for any effort which could be called political.  In



the early spring of 1868 I went to Europe to examine



institutions for scientific and technological instruction,



and to secure professors and equipment, and during about



six months I visited a great number of such schools,



especially those in agriculture, mechanical, civil, and mining



engineering and the like in England, France, Germany,



and Italy; bought largely of books and apparatus,



discussed the problems at issue with Europeans who seemed



likely to know most about them, secured sundry professors,



and returned in September just in time to take



part in the opening of Cornell University and be inaugurated



as its first president.  Of all this I shall speak more



in detail hereafter.







There was no especial temptation to activity in the



political campaign of that year; for the election of General



Grant was sure, and my main memory of the period is a



visit to Auburn to hear Mr. Seward.







It had been his wont for many years, when he came



home to cast his vote, to meet his neighbors on the eve of



the election and give his views of the situation and of its



resultant duties.  These occasions had come to be anticipated



with the deepest interest by the whole region round



about, and what had begun as a little gathering of neighors 



had now become such an assembly that the largest



hall in the place was crowded with voters of all parties.







But this year came a disappointment.  Although the



contest was between General Grant,--who on various decisive



battle-fields had done everything to save the administration



of which Mr. Seward had been a leading member,



--and on the other side, Governor Horatio Seymour, who



had done all in his power to wreck it, Mr. Seward devoted



his speech to optimistic generalities, hardly alluding to



the candidates, and leaving the general impression that



one side was just as worthy of support as the other.







The speech was an unfortunate ending of Mr. Seward's



career.  It was not surprising that some of his old



admirers bitterly resented it, and a remark by Mr. Cornell



some time afterward indicated much.  We were arranging



together a program for the approaching annual



commencement when I suggested for the main address Mr.



Seward.  Mr. Cornell had been one of Mr. Seward's



lifelong supporters, but he received this proposal coldly,



pondered it for a few moments silently, and then said



dryly, ``Perhaps you are right, but if you call him you



will show to our students the deadest man that ain't buried



in the State of New York.''  So, to my regret, was lost the



last chance to bring the old statesman to Cornell.  I have



always regretted this loss; his presence would have given



a true consecration to the new institution.  A career like



his should not be judged by its little defects and lapses,



and this I felt even more deeply on receiving, some time



after his death, the fifth volume of his published works,



which was largely made up of his despatches and other



papers written during the war.  When they were first



published in the newspapers, I often thought them long



and was impatient at their optimism, but now, when I read



them all together, saw in them the efforts made by the



heroic old man to keep the hands of European powers



off us while we were restoring the Union, and noted the



desperation with which he fought, the encouragement



which he infused into our diplomatic representatives



abroad, and his struggle, almost against fate, in the time



of our reverses, I was fascinated.  The book had arrived



early in the evening, and next morning found me still



seated in my library chair completely absorbed in it.







In the spring of the year 1870, while as usual in the



thick of university work, I was again drawn for a moment



into the current of New York politics.  The long wished



for amendment of the State constitution, putting our highest



tribunal, the Court of Appeals, on a better footing



than it had ever been before, making it more adequate, the



term longer, and the salaries higher, had been passed, and



judges were to be chosen at the next election.  Each of the



two great parties was entitled to an equal number of



judges, and I was requested to go to the approaching



nominating convention at Rochester in order to present



the name of my old friend and neighbor, Charles Andrews.







It was a most honorable duty, no man could have



desired a better candidate, and I gladly accepted the



mandate.  Although it was one of the most staid and dignified



bodies of the sort which has ever met in the State, it had



as a preface a pleasant farce.







As usual, the seething cauldron of New York City politics



had thrown to the surface some troublesome delegates,



and among them was one long famed as a ``Tammany Republican.''







Our first business was the choice of a president for the



convention, and, as it had been decided by the State committee



to present for that office the name of one of the most



respected judges in the State, the Honorable Platt Potter,



of Schenectady, it was naturally expected that some member



of the regular organization would present his name



in a dignified speech.  But hardly had the chairman of



the State committee called the convention to order when



the aforesaid Tammany Republican, having heard that



Judge Potter was to be elected, thought evidently that



he could gain recognition and applause by being the



first to present his name.  He therefore rushed for-



ward, and almost before the chairman had declared the



convention opened, cried out:  ``Mr. Chairman, I move



you, sir, that the Honorable `Pot Platter' be made



president of this convention.''  A scream of laughter went



up from all parts of the house, and in an instant a gentleman



rose and moved to amend by making the name ``Platt



Potter.''  This was carried, and the proposer of the



original motion retired crestfallen to his seat.







I had the honor of presenting Mr. Andrews's name. 



He was nominated and elected triumphantly, and so began



the career of one of the best judges that New York



has ever had on its highest court, who has also for many



years occupied, with the respect and esteem of the State,



the position of chief justice.







The convention then went on to nominate other judges,



--nomination being equivalent to election,--but when the



last name was reached there came a close contest.  An old



friend informed me that Judge Folger, my former colleague



in the Senate and since that assistant treasurer of



the United States in the city of New York, was exceedingly



anxious to escape from this latter position, and



desired greatly the nomination to a judgeship on the Court



of Appeals.







I decided at once to do what was possible to secure



Judge Folger's nomination, though our personal relations



were very unsatisfactory.  Owing to our two conflicts at



the close of our senatorial term above referred to, and



to another case where I thought he had treated me



unjustly, we had never exchanged a word since I had left



the State Senate; and though we met each other from



time to time on the board of Cornell University trustees,



we passed each other in silence.  Our old friendship, which



had been very dear to me, seemed forever broken, but I



felt deeply that the fault was not mine.  At the same time



I recognized the fact that Judge Folger was not especially



adapted to the position of assistant treasurer of the United



States, and was admirably fitted for the position of judge



in the Court of Appeals.  I therefore did everything possible 



to induce one or two of the delegations with which I



had some influence to vote for him, dwelling especially



upon his former judgeship, his long acquaintance with the



legislation of the State, and his high character, and at last



he was elected by a slight majority.







The convention having adjourned, I was on my way to



the train when I was met by Judge Folger, who had just



arrived.  He put out his hand and greeted me most heartily,



showing very deep feeling as he expressed his regret



over our estrangement.  Of course I was glad that bygones



were to be bygones, and that our old relations were



restored.  He became a most excellent judge, and finally



chief justice of the State, which position he left to become



Secretary of the Treasury.







To the political cataclysm which ended his public activity



and doubtless hastened his death, I refer elsewhere. 



As long as he lived our friendly relations continued, and



this has been to me ever since a great satisfaction.







In this same year, 1870, occurred my first extended



conversation with General Grant.  At my earlier meeting with



him when he was with President Johnson in Albany, I had



merely been stiffly presented to him, and we had exchanged



a few commonplaces; but I was now invited to his



cottage at Long Branch and enjoyed a long and pleasant



talk with him.  Its main subject was the Franco-German



War then going on, and his sympathies were evidently



with Germany.  His comments on the war were prophetic. 



There was nothing dogmatic in them; nothing could be



more simple and modest than his manner and utterance,



but there was a clearness and quiet force in them which



impressed me greatly.  He was the first great general I



had ever seen, and I was strongly reminded of his mingled



diffidence and mastery when, some years afterward, I



talked with Moltke in Berlin.







Another experience of that summer dwells in my memory. 



I was staying, during the first week of September,



with my dear old friend, Dr. Henry M. Field, at Stockbridge,



in the Berkshire Mountains of Massachusetts, and



had the good fortune, at the house of his brother, the



eminent jurist, David Dudley Field, to pass a rainy evening



in company with Mr. Burton Harrison, who, after a



distinguished career at Yale, had been the private secretary



of Jefferson Davis, president of the Southern Confederacy. 



On that evening a storm had kept away all but a



few of us, and Mr. Harrison yielded to our entreaties to



give us an account of Mr. Davis's flight at the surrender of



Richmond, from the time when he quietly left his pew in



St. Paul's Church to that of his arrest by United States



soldiers.  The story was most vivid, and Mr. Harrison, as



an eye witness, told it simply and admirably.  There had



already grown out of this flight of Mr. Davis a most



luxuriant tangle of myth and legend, and it had come to



be generally believed that the Confederate president had



at last endeavored to shield himself behind the women of



his household; that when arrested he was trying to escape



in the attire of his wife, including a hooped skirt and a



bonnet, and that he was betrayed by an incautious display



of his military boots beneath his wife's flounces.  The



simple fact was that, having separated from his family



party, and seeking escape to the coast or mountains, he



was again and again led by his affection for his family to



return to them, his fears for them overcoming all care



for himself; and that, as he was suffering from neuralgia,



he wore over his clothing, to guard him from the incessant



rain, Mrs. Davis' waterproof cloak.  Out of this grew the



legend which found expression in jubilant newspaper



articles, songs, and caricatures.







This reminds me that some years later, my old college



friend, Colonel William Preston Johnston, president of



Tulane University, told me a story which throws light



upon that collapse of the Confederacy.  Colonel Johnston



was at that period the military secretary of President



Davis, and, as the catastrophe approached, was much



vexed at the interminable debates in the Confederate



Congress.  Among the subjects of these discussions was the



great seal of the Confederacy.  It had been decided to



adopt for this purpose a relief representing Crawford's



statue of Washington at Richmond, with the Southern



statesmen and soldiers surrounding it; but though all



agreed that Washington, in his Continental costume, and



holding in his hand his cocked hat, should retain the



central position, there were many differences of opinion as



to the surrounding portraits, the result being that motions



were made to strike out this or that revolutionary hero



from one State and to replace him by another from another



State, thus giving rise to lengthy eulogies of these



various personages, so that the whole thing resembled the



discussions in metaphysical theology by the Byzantines



at the time when the Turks were forcing their way



through the walls of Constantinople.  One day, just



before the final catastrophe, Mr. Judah Benjamin, formerly



United States senator, but at that time the Confederate



secretary of state, passed through Colonel Johnston's



office, and the following dialogue took place.







Colonel Johnston:  ``What are they doing in the Senate



and House, Mr. Secretary?''







Mr. Benjamin:  ``Oh, simply debating the Confederate



seal, moving to strike out this man and to insert that.''







Colonel Johnston:  ``Do you know what motion I would



make if I were a member?''







Mr. Benjamin:  ``No, what would you move?''







Colonel Johnston:  ``I would move to strike out from



the seal everything except the cocked hat.''







Colonel Johnston was right; the Confederacy was



``knocked into a cocked hat'' a few days afterward.







In the autumn of that year, September, 1870, I was sent



as a delegate to the State Republican Convention, and



presented as a candidate for the lieutenant-governorship a



man who had served the State admirably in the National



Congress and in the State legislature as well as in great



business operations, Mr. DeWitt Littlejohn of Oswego.  I



did this on the part of sundry gentlemen who were anxious



to save the Republican ticket, which had at its head my



old friend General Woodford, but though I was successful



in securing Mr. Littlejohn's nomination, he soon



afterward declined, and defeat followed in November.







The only part which I continued to take in State politics



was in writing letters and in speaking, on sundry social



occasions of a political character, in behalf of harmony



between the two factions which were now becoming more



and more bitter.  At first I seemed to have some success,



but before long it became clear that the current was too



strong and that the bitterness of faction was to prevail.  I



am so constituted that factious thought and effort



dishearten and disgust me.  At many periods of my life



I have acted as a ``buffer'' between conflicting cliques



and factions, generally to some purpose; now it was



otherwise.  But, as Kipling says, ``that is another story.''







The hard work and serious responsibilities brought



upon me by the new university had greatly increased. 



They had worn deeply upon me when, in the winter of



1870-71, came an event which drew me out of my university



life for a time and gave me a much needed change:



--I was sent by the President as one of the three



commissioners to Santo Domingo to study questions relating



to the annexation of the Spanish part of that island which



was then proposed, and to report thereupon to Congress.







While in Washington at this time I saw much of President



Grant, Mr. Sumner, and various other men who were



then leading in public affairs, but some account of them



will be given in my reminiscences of the Santo Domingo



expedition.







I trust that it may be allowed me here to recall an



incident which ought to have been given in a preceding



chapter.  During one of my earlier visits to the National



Capital, I made the acquaintance of Senator McDougal. 



His distorted genius had evidently so dazzled his fellow-



citizens of California that, in spite of his defects, they had



sent him to the highest council of the Nation.  He was a



martyr to conviviality, and when more or less under



the sway of it, had strange ideas and quaint ways of



expressing them.  His talk recalled to me a time in my child-



hood when, having found a knob of glass, twisted, striated



with different colors, and filled with air bubbles, I enjoyed



looking at the landscape through it.  Everything became



grotesquely transfigured.  A cabbage in the foreground



became opalescent, and an ear of corn a mass of jewels,



but the whole atmosphere above and beyond was lurid, and



the chimneys and church spires were topsy-turvy.







The only other person whose talk ever produced an



impression of this sort on me was Tolstoy, and he will be



discussed in another chapter.







McDougal's peculiarity made him at last unbearable;



so much so that the Senate was obliged to take measures



against him.  His speech in his own defense showed the



working of his mind, and one passage most of all.  It



remains probably the best defense of drunkenness ever



made, and it ran as follows:







``Mr. President,--I pity the man who has never viewed



the affairs of this world, save from the poor, low, miserable



plane of ordinary sobriety.''







My absence in the West Indies covered the first three



months of the year 1871, and then the commission returned



to Washington and made its report; but regarding



this I shall speak at length in the chapter of my diplomatic



experiences, devoted to the Santo Domingo question.















CHAPTER X







THE GREELEY CAMPAIGN--1872







Having finished my duties on the Santo Domingo



Commission, I returned to the University in May



of 1871, devoted myself again to my duties as president



and professor, and, in the mass of arrears which had



accumulated, found ample occupation.  I also delivered



various addresses at universities, colleges, and elsewhere,



keeping as remote from politics as possible.







In June, visiting New York in order to take part in a



dinner given by various journalists and others to my



classmate and old friend, George Washburne Smalley, at



that time the London correspondent of the ``New York



Tribune,'' I met, for the first time, Colonel John Hay,



who was in the full tide of his brilliant literary career and



who is, as I write this, Secretary of State of the United



States.  His clear, thoughtful talk strongly impressed me,



but the most curious circumstance connected with the affair



was that several of us on the way to Delmonico's



stopped for a time to observe the public reception given to



Mr. Horace Greeley on his return from a tour through the



Southern States.  Mr. Greeley, undoubtedly from the



purest personal and patriotic motives, had, with other



men of high standing, including Gerrit Smith, attached



his name to the bail bond of Jefferson Davis, which



released the ex-president of the Confederacy from prison,



and, in fact, freed him entirely from anything like



punishment for treason.  I have always admired Mr. Greeley's



honesty and courage in doing this.  Doubtless, too, an



equally patriotic and honest desire to aid in bringing



North and South together after the war led him to take



an extensive tour through sundry Southern States.  He



had just returned from this tour and this reception was



given him in consequence.







It had already been noised abroad that there was a



movement on foot to make him a candidate for the Presidency,



and many who knew the characteristics of the man,



even those who, like myself, had been greatly influenced



by him and regarded him as by far the foremost editorial



writer that our country had ever produced, looked upon



this idea with incredulity.  For of all patriotic men in



the entire country who had touched public affairs Horace



Greeley seemed the most eminently unfit for executive



duties.  He was notoriously, in business matters, the



easy prey of many who happened to get access to him;--



the ``long-haired men and short-haired women'' of the



country seemed at times to have him entirely under their



sway; his hard-earned money, greatly needed by himself



and his family, was lavished upon ne'er-do-weels and cast



into all sorts of impracticable schemes.  He made loans



to the discarded son of the richest man whom the United



States had at that time produced, and in every way



showed himself an utterly incompetent judge of men.  It



was a curious fact that lofty as were his purposes, and



noble as were his main characteristics, the best men of



the State--men like Seward, Weed, Judge Folger, Senator



Andrews, General Leavenworth, Elbridge Spaulding, and



other really thoughtful, solid, substantial advisers of



the Republican party--were disliked by him, and yet no



other reason could be assigned than this:--that while they



all admired him as a writer, they could not be induced to



pretend that they considered him fit for high executive



office, either in the State or Nation.  On the other hand,



so far as politics were concerned, his affections seemed to



be lavished on politicians who flattered and coddled him. 



Of this the rise of Governor Fenton was a striking



example.  Doubtless there were exceptions to this rule, but



it was the rule nevertheless.  This was clearly and indeed



comically shown at the reception given him in Union



Square on the evening referred to.  Mr. Greeley appeared



at a front window of a house on the Broadway side and



came out upon a temporary platform.  His appearance



is deeply stamped upon my memory.  He was in a rather



slouchy evening dress, his white hair thrown back off his



splendid forehead, and his broad, smooth, kindly features



as serene as the face of a big, well-washed baby.







There was in his appearance something at the same time



na<i:>ve and impressive, and the simplicity of it was



increased by a bouquet, huge and gorgeous, which some



admirer had attached to his coat, and which forced upon



the mind of a reflective observer the idea of a victim



adorned for sacrifice.







He gave scant attention to his audience in the way of



ceremonial greeting, and plunged at once into his subject;



--beginning in a high, piping, falsetto voice which, for a



few moments, was almost painful.  But the value of his



matter soon overcame the defects of his manner; the



speech was in his best vein; it struck me as the best, on the



whole, I had ever heard him make, and that is saying



much.  Holding in his hands a little package of



cards on which notes were jotted down, he occasionally



cast his eyes upon them, but he evidently trusted to the



inspiration of the hour for his phrasing, and his trust was



not misplaced.  I never heard a more simple, strong,



lucid use of the English language than was his on that



occasion.  The speech was a very noble plea for the restoration



of good feeling between North and South, with an



effort to show that the distrust felt by the South toward



the North was natural.  In the course of it he said in



substance:







``Fellow Citizens:  The people of the South have much



reason to distrust us.  We have sent among them during



the war and since the war, to govern them, to hold office



among them, and to eat out their substance, a number of



worthless adventurers whom they call ``carpet-baggers.'' 



These emissaries of ours pretend to be patriotic and pious;



they pull long faces and say `Let us pray'; but they spell



it p-r-E-y.  The people of the South hate them, and they



ought to hate them.''







At this we in the audience looked at each other in



amazement; for, standing close beside Mr. Greeley, at



that very moment, most obsequiously, was perhaps the



worst ``carpet-bagger'' ever sent into the South; a man



who had literally been sloughed off by both parties;--



who, having been become an unbearable nuisance in New



York politics, had been ``unloaded'' by Mr. Lincoln, in an



ill-inspired moment, upon the hapless South, and who was



now trying to find new pasture.







But this was not the most comical thing; for Mr.



Greeley in substance continued as follows:







``Fellow Citizens:  You know how it is yourselves. 



There are men who go to your own State Capitol, nominally



as legislators or advisers, but really to plunder and



steal.  These men in the Northern States correspond to the



`carpet-baggers' in the Southern States, and you hate



them and you ought to hate them.''  Thus speaking, Mr.



Greeley poured out the vials of his wrath against all this



class of people; blissfully unconscious of the fact that on



the other side of him stood the most notorious and corrupt



lobbyist who had been known in Albany for years;--



a man who had been chased out of that city by the sheriff



for attempted bribery, had been obliged to remain for a



considerable time in hiding to avoid criminal charges of



exerting corrupt influence on legislation, and whom both



political parties naturally disowned.  Comical as all this



was, it was pathetic to see a man like Greeley in such a



cave of Adullam.







During this summer of 1871 occurred the death of



one of my dearest friends, a man who had exercised a



most happy influence over my opinions and who had



contributed much to the progress of anti-slavery ideas in



New England and New York.  This was the Rev.



Samuel Joseph May, pastor of the Unitarian Church in



Syracuse, a friend and associate of Emerson, Garrison,



Phillips, Gerrit Smith, and one of the noblest, truest, and



most beautiful characters I have ever known.







Having seen the end of slavery, and being about eighty



years of age, he felt deeply that his work was done, and



thenceforward declared that he was happy in the idea



that his life on this planet was soon to end.  I have never



seen, save in the case of the Hicksite Quaker at Ann



Arbor, referred to elsewhere, such a living faith in the



reality of another world.  Again and again Mr. May said



to me in the most cheerful way imaginable, ``I am as much



convinced of the existence of a future state as of these



scenes about me, and, to tell you the truth, now that my



work here is ended, I am becoming very curious to know



what the next stage of existence is like.''  On the afternoon



of the 1st of July I paid him a visit, found him much



wearied by a troublesome chronic complaint, but contented,



cheerful, peaceful as ever.







Above him as he lay in his bed was a portrait which I



had formerly seen in his parlor.  Thereby hung a curious



tale.  Years before, at the very beginning of Mr. May's



career, he had been a teacher in the town of Canterbury,



Connecticut, when Miss Prudence Crandall was persecuted,



arrested, and imprisoned for teaching colored children. 



Mr. May had taken up her case earnestly, and, with the aid



of Mr. Lafayette Foster, afterward president of the United



States Senate, had fought it out until the enemies of Miss



Crandall were beaten.  As a memorial of this activity of



his, Mr. May received this large, well painted portrait of



Miss Crandall, and it was one of his most valued possessions.







On the afternoon referred to, after talking about



various other matters most cheerfully, and after I had told



him that we could not spare him yet, that we needed him at



least ten years longer, he laughingly said, ``Can't you



compromise on one year?''  ``No,'' I said, ``nothing less



than ten years.  ``Thereupon he laughed pleasantly, called



his daughter, Mrs. Wilkinson, and said, ``Remember;



when I am gone this portrait of Prudence Crandall is to



go to Andrew White for Cornell University, where my



anti-slavery books already are.''  As I left him, both of



us were in the most cheerful mood, he appearing better



than during some weeks previous.  Next morning I



learned that he had died during the night.  The portrait



of Miss Crandall now hangs in the Cornell University Library.







My summer was given up partly to recreation mingled



with duties of various sorts, including an address in honor



of President Woolsey at the Alumni dinner at Yale and



another at the laying of the corner stone of Syracuse



University.







Noteworthy at this period was a dinner with Longfellow



at Cambridge, and I recall vividly his showing me



various places in the Craigie house connected with interesting



passages in the life of Washington when he occupied it.







Early in the autumn, while thus engrossed in everything



but political matters, I received a letter from my



friend Mr. A. B. Cornell, a most energetic and efficient



man in State and national politics, a devoted supporter



of General Grant and Senator Conkling, and afterward



governor of the State of New York, asking me if I would



go to the approaching State convention and accept its



presidency.  I wrote him in return expressing my reluctance,



dwelling upon the duties pressing upon me in connection



with the university, and asking to be excused.  In



return came a very earnest letter insisting on the



importance of the convention in keeping the Republican party



together, and in preventing its being split into factions



before the approaching presidential election.  I had, on



all occasions, and especially at various social gatherings



at which political leaders were present, in New York and



elsewhere, urged the importance of throwing aside all



factious spirit and harmonizing the party in view of the



coming election, and to this Mr. Cornell referred very



earnestly.  As a consequence I wrote him that if the 



delegates from New York opposed to General Grant could be



admitted to the convention on equal terms with those who



favored him, and if he, Mr. Cornell, and the other managers



of the Grant wing of the party would agree that the



anti-Grant forces should receive full and fair representation



on the various committees, I would accept the presidency



of the convention in the interest of peace between



the factions, and would do my best to harmonize the differing



interests in the party, but that otherwise I would not



consent to be a member of the convention.  In his answer



Mr. Cornell fully agreed to this, and I have every reason



to believe, indeed to know, that his agreement was kept. 



The day of the convention having arrived (September 27,



1871), Mr. Cornell, as chairman of the Republican State



committee, called the assemblage to order, and after a



somewhat angry clash with the opponents of the administration,



nominated me to the chairmanship of the convention.







By a freak of political fortune I was separated in this



contest from my old friend Chauncey M. Depew; but



though on different sides of the question at issue, we sat



together chatting pleasantly as the vote went on, neither



of us, I think, very anxious regarding it, and when the



election was decided in my favor he was one of those who,



under instructions from the temporary chairman, very



courteously conducted me to the chair.  It was an immense



assemblage, and from the first it was evident that there



were very turbulent elements in it.  Hardly, indeed, had



I taken my seat, when the chief of the Syracuse police



informed me that there were gathered near the platform



a large body of Tammany roughs who had come from New



York expressly to interfere with the convention, just as



a few years before they had interfered in the same place



with the convention of their own party, seriously wounding



its regular chairman; but that I need have no alarm



at any demonstration they might make; that the police



were fully warned and able to meet the adversary.







In my opening speech I made an earnest plea for peace



among the various factions of the party, and especially



between those who favored and those who opposed the



administration; this plea was received with kindness, and



shortly afterward came the appointment of committees. 



Of course, like every other president of such a body, I



had to rely on the standing State committee.  Hardly one



man in a thousand coming to the presidency of a State



convention knows enough of the individual leaders of politics



in all the various localities to distinguish between their



shades of opinion.  It was certainly impossible for me to



know all those who, in the various counties of the State,



favored General Grant and those who disliked him.  Like



every other president of a convention, probably without



an exception, from the beginning to the present hour, I



received the list of the convention committees from the



State committee which represented the party, and I received



this list, not only with implied, but express assurances



that the agreement under which I had taken the



chairmanship had been complied with;--namely, that the



list represented fairly the two wings of the party in



convention, and that both the Grant and the anti-Grant



delegations from New York city were to be admitted on equal



terms.







I had no reason then, and have no reason now, to believe



that the State committee abused my confidence.  I feel sure



now, as I felt sure then, that the committee named by me



fairly represented the two wings of the party; but after



their appointment it was perfectly evident that this did



not propitiate the anti-administration wing.  They were



deeply angered against the administration by the fact that



General Grant had taken as his adviser in regard to New



York patronage and politics Senator Conkling rather than



Senator Fenton.  Doubtless Senator Conkling's manner



in dealing with those opposed to him had made many



enemies who, by milder methods, might have been brought



to the support of the administration.  At any rate, it was



soon clear that the anti-administration forces, recognizing



their inferiority in point of numbers, were determined to



secede.  This, indeed, was soon formally announced by one



of their leaders; but as they still continued after this



declaration to take part in the discussions, the point of order



was raised that, having formally declared their intention



of leaving the convention, they were no longer entitled to



take part in its deliberations.  This point I ruled out,



declaring that I could not consider the anti-administration



wing as outside the convention until they had left it.  The



debates grew more and more bitter, Mr. Conkling making,



late at night, a powerful speech which rallied the forces of



the administration and brought them victory.  The anti-



administration delegates now left the convention, but before



they did so one of them rose and eloquently tendered



to me as president the thanks of his associates for my



impartiality, saying that it contrasted most honorably with



the treatment they had received from certain other members



of the convention.  But shortly after leaving they



held a meeting in another place, and, having evidently



made up their minds that they must declare war against



everybody who remained in the convention, they



denounced us all alike, and the same gentleman who had



made the speech thanking me for my fairness, and who



was very eminent among those who were known as ``Tammany



Republicans,'' now made a most violent harangue



in which he declared that a man who conducted himself



as I had done, and who remained in such an infamous



convention, or had anything to do with it, was ``utterly



unfit to be an instructor of youth.''







Similar attacks continued to appear in the anti-



administration papers for a considerable time afterward, and at



first they were rather trying to me.  I felt that nothing



could be more unjust, for I had strained to the last degree



my influence with my associates who supported General



Grant in securing concessions to those who differed from



us.  Had these attacks been made by organs of the opposite



political party, I would not have minded them; but



being made in sundry journals which had represented the



Republican party and were constantly read by my old



friends, neighbors, and students, they naturally, for a



time, disquieted me.  One of the charges then made has



often amused me as I have looked back upon it since, and



is worth referring to as an example of the looseness of



statement common among the best of American political



journals during exciting political contests.  This charge



was that I had ``sought to bribe people to support the



administration by offering them consulates.''  This was



echoed in various parts of the State.







The facts were as follows:  An individual who had made



some money as a sutler in connection with the army had



obtained control of a local paper at Syracuse, and, through



the influence thus gained, an election to the lower house of



the State legislature.  During the winter which he passed



at Albany he was one of three or four Republicans who



voted with the Democrats in behalf of the measures



proposed by Tweed, the municipal arch-robber afterward



convicted and punished for his crimes against the city of



New York.  Just at this particular time Tweed was at the



height of his power, and at a previous session of the



legislature he had carried his measures through the



Assembly by the votes of three or four Republicans who were



needed in addition to the Democratic votes in order to



give him the required majority.  Many leading Republican



journals had published the names of these three or



four men with black lines around them, charging them,



apparently justly, with having sold themselves to Tweed



for money, and among them the person above referred



to.  Though he controlled a newspaper in Syracuse, he



had been unable to secure renomination to the legislature,



and, shortly afterward, in order to secure rehabilitation



as well as pelf, sought an appointment to the Syracuse



postmastership.  Senator Conkling, mindful of the man's



record, having opposed the appointment, and the President



having declined to make it, the local paper under



control of this person turned most bitterly against the



administration, and day after day poured forth diatribes



against the policy and the persons of all connected with



the actual government at Washington, and especially



against President Grant and Senator Conkling.







The editor of the paper at that time was a very gifted



young writer, an old schoolmate and friend of mine, who,



acting under instructions from the managers of the paper,



took a very bitter line against the administration and its



supporters.







About the time of the meeting of the convention this



old friend came to me, expressed his regret at the line he



was obliged to take, said that both he and his wife were



sick of the whole thing and anxious to get out of it, and



added:  ``The only way out, that I can see, is some appointment



that will at once relieve me of all these duties, and



in fact take me out of the country.  Cannot you aid me by



application to the senator or the President in obtaining a



consulate?''  I answered him laughingly, ``My dear ----,



I will gladly do all I can for you, not only for friendship's



sake, but because I think you admirably fitted for the place



you name; but don't you think that, for a few days at



least, while you are applying for such a position, you



might as well stop your outrageous attacks against the



very men from whom you hope to receive the appointment?''







Having said this, half in jest and half in earnest, I



thought no more on the subject, save as to the best way of



aiding my friend to secure the relief he desired.







So rose the charge that I was ``bribing persons to support



the administration by offering them consulates.''







But strong friends rallied to my support.  Mr. George



William Curtis in ``Harper's Weekly,'' Mr. Godkin in



``The Nation,'' Mr. Charles Dudley Warner and others



in various other journals took up the cudgels in my behalf,



and I soon discovered that the attacks rather helped than



hurt me.  They did much, indeed, to disgust me for a time



with political life; but I soon found that my friends, my



students, and the country at large understood the charges,



and that they seemed to think more rather than less of me



on account of them.  In those days the air was full of that



sort of onslaught upon every one supposed to be friendly



to General Grant, and the effect in one case was revealed



to me rather curiously.  Matthew Carpenter, of Wisconsin,



was then one of the most brilliant members of the United



States Senate, a public servant of whom his State was



proud; but he had cordially supported the administration



and was consequently made the mark for bitter attack, day



after day and week after week, by the opposing journals,



and these attacks finally culminated in an attempt to base



a very ugly scandal against him upon what was known



among his friends to be a simple courtesy publicly



rendered to a very worthy lady.  The attacks and the scandal



resounded throughout the anti-administration papers,



their evident purpose being to defeat his re<e:>lection to the



United States Senate.







But just before the time for the senatorial election in



Wisconsin, meeting a very bright and active-minded student



of my senior class who came from that State, I asked



him, ``What is the feeling among your people regarding



the re<e:>lection of Senator Carpenter?''  My student



immediately burst into a torrent of wrath and answered:  ``The



people of Wisconsin will send Mr. Carpenter back to the



Senate by an enormous majority.  We will see if a gang



of newspaper blackguards can slander one of our senators



out of public life.''  The result was as my young friend



had foretold:  Mr. Carpenter was triumphantly re<e:>lected.







While I am on this subject I may refer, as a comfort to



those who have found themselves unjustly attacked in



political matters, to two other notable cases within my



remembrance.







Probably no such virulence has ever been known day



after day, year after year, as was shown by sundry presses



of large circulation in their attacks on William H. Seward. 



They represented him as shady and tricky; as the lowest



of demagogues; as utterly without conscience or ability;



as pretending a hostility to slavery which was simply



a craving for popularity; they refused to report his



speeches, or, if they did report them, distorted them.  He



had also incurred the displeasure of very many leaders



of his own party, and of some of its most powerful presses,



yet he advanced steadily from high position to high



position, and won a lasting and most honorable place in the



history of his country.







The same may be said of Senator Conkling.  The attacks



on him in the press were bitter and almost universal;



yet the only visible result was that he was re<e:>lected to the



national Senate by an increased majority.  To the catastrophe



which some years later ended his political career,



the onslaught by the newspapers contributed nothing; it



resulted directly from the defects of his own great



qualities and not at all from attacks made upon him from



outside.







Almost from the first moment of my acquaintance with



Mr. Conkling, I had endeavored to interest him in the reform



of the civil service, and at least, if this was not



possible, to prevent his actively opposing it.  In this sense



I wrote him various letters.  For a time they seemed successful;



but at last, under these attacks, he broke all bounds



and became the bitter opponent of the movement.  In his



powerful manner and sonorous voice he from time to time



expressed his contempt for it.  The most striking of his



utterances on the subject was in one of the State conventions,



which, being given in his deep, sonorous tones, ran



much as follows:  ``When Doctor-r-r Ja-a-awnson said that



patr-r-riotism-m was the l-a-w-s-t r-r-refuge of a scoundr-r-rel,



he ignor-r-red the enor-r-rmous possibilities of



the word r-refa-awr-r-rm!''







The following spring (June 5, 1872) I attended the



Republican National Convention at Philadelphia as a



substitute delegate.  It was very interesting and, unlike the



enormous assemblages since of twelve or fifteen thousand



people at Chicago and elsewhere, was a really deliberative



body.  As it was held in the Academy of Music, there was



room for a sufficient audience, while there was not room



for a vast mob overpowering completely the members of



the convention and preventing any real discussion at some



most important junctures, as has been the case in so many



conventions of both parties in these latter years.







The most noteworthy features of this convention were



the speeches of sundry colored delegates from the South. 



Very remarkable they were, and a great revelation as to



the ability of some, at least, of their race in the former



slave States.







General Grant was renominated for the Presidency,



and for the Vice-Presidency Mr. Henry Wilson of Massachusetts



in place of Schuyler Colfax, who had held the position



during General Grant's first term.







The only speeches I made during the campaign were



one from the balcony of the Continental Hotel in Philadelphia



and one from the steps of the Delavan House at





Albany, but they were perfunctory and formal.  There



was really no need of speeches, and I was longing to go at



my proper university work.  Mr. James Anthony Froude,



the historian, had arrived from England to deliver his



lectures before our students; and, besides this, the university



had encountered various difficulties which engrossed



all my thoughts.







General Grant's re<e:>lection was a great victory.  Mr.



Greeley had not one Northern electoral vote; worst of all,



he had, during the contest, become utterly broken in body



and mind, and shortly after the election he died.







His death was a sad ending of a career which, as a



whole, had been so beneficent.  As to General Grant, I believe



now, as I believed then, that his election was a great



blessing, and that he was one of the noblest, purest, and



most capable men who have ever sat in the Presidency. 



The cheap, clap-trap antithesis which has at times been



made between Grant the soldier and Grant the statesman



is, I am convinced, utterly without foundation.  The



qualities which made him a great soldier made him an



effective statesman.  This fact was clearly recognized



by the American people at various times during the



war, and especially when, at the surrender of Appomattox,



he declined to deprive General Lee of his sword,



and quietly took the responsibility of allowing the



soldiers of the Southern army to return with their horses



to their fields to resume peaceful industry.  These



statesmanlike qualities were developed more and more



by the great duties and responsibilities of the Presidency. 



His triumph over financial demagogy in his vetoes



of the Inflation Bill, and his triumph over political demagogy



in securing the treaty of Washington and the Alabama



indemnity, prove him a statesman worthy to rank



with the best of his predecessors.  In view of these



evidences of complete integrity and high capacity, and



bearing in mind various conversations which I had with him



during his public life down to a period just before his



death, I feel sure that history will pronounce him not only



a general but a statesman in the best sense of the word.







The renomination of General Grant at the Philadelphia



convention was the result of gratitude, respect, and conviction



of his fitness.  Although Mr. Greeley had the support



of the most influential presses of the United States, and



was widely beloved and respected as one who had borne



the burden and heat of the day, he was defeated in obedience



to a healthy national instinct.







Years afterward I was asked in London by one of the



most eminent of English journalists how such a thing



could have taken place.  Said he, ``The leading papers of



the United States, almost without exception, were in favor



of Mr. Greeley; how, then, did it happen that he was in



such a hopeless minority?''  I explained the matter as



best I could, whereupon he said, ``Whatever the explanation



may be, it proves that the American press, by its wild



statements in political campaigns, and especially by its



reckless attacks upon individuals, has lost that hold upon



American opinion which it ought to have; and, depend



upon it, this is a great misfortune for your country.''  I



did not attempt to disprove this statement, for I knew but



too well that there was great truth in it.







Of my political experiences at that period I recall two:



the first of these was making the acquaintance at Saratoga 



of Mr. Samuel J. Tilden.  His political fortunes were



then at their lowest point.  With Mr. Dean Richmond of



Buffalo, he had been one of the managers of the Democratic



party in the State, but, Mr. Richmond having died,



the Tweed wing of the party, supported by the canal



contractors, had declared war against Mr. Tilden, treated



him with contempt, showed their aversion to him in every



way, and, it was fully understood, had made up their



minds to depose him.  I remember walking and talking



again and again with him under the colonnade at Congress



Hall, and, without referring to any person by name, he



dwelt upon the necessity of more earnest work in redeeming



American politics from the management of men utterly



unfit for leadership.  Little did he or I foresee that



soon afterward his arch-enemy, Tweed, then in the same



hotel and apparently all-powerful, was to be a fugitive



from justice, and finally to die in prison, and that he, Mr.



Tilden himself, was to be elected governor of the State of



New York, and to come within a hair's-breadth of the



presidential chair at Washington.







The other circumstance of a political character was my



attendance as an elector at the meeting of the Electoral



College at Albany, which cast the vote of New York for



General Grant.  I had never before sat in such a body, and



its proceedings interested me.  As president we elected



General Stewart L. Woodford, and as the body, after the



formal election of General Grant to the Presidency, was



obliged to send certificates to the governor of the State,



properly signed and sealed, and as it had no seal of its



own, General Woodford asked if any member had a seal



which he would lend to the secretary for that purpose. 



Thereupon a seal-ring which Goldwin Smith had brought



from Rome and given me was used for that purpose.  It



was an ancient intaglio.  Very suitably, it bore the figure



of a ``Winged Victory,'' and it was again publicly used,



many years later, when it was affixed to the American



signature of the international agreement made at the



Peace Conference of The Hague.







The following winter I had my first experience of



``Reconstruction'' in the South.  Being somewhat worn with



work, I made a visit to Florida, passing leisurely through



the southern seaboard States, and finding at Columbia



an old Yale friend, Governor Chamberlain, from whom I



learned much.  But the simple use of my eyes and ears



during the journey gave me more than all else.  A visit



to the State legislature of South Carolina revealed vividly



the new order of things.  The State Capitol was a beautiful



marble building, but unfinished without and dirty



within.  Approaching the hall of the House of Representatives,



I found the door guarded by a negro, squalid and



filthy.  He evidently reveled in his new citizenship; his



chair was tilted back against the wall, his feet were high



in the air, and he was making everything nauseous about



him with tobacco; but he soon became obsequious and



admitted us to one of the most singular deliberative bodies



ever known--a body composed of former landed proprietors



and slave-owners mixed up pell-mell with their



former slaves and with Northern adventurers then known



as ``carpet-baggers.''  The Southern gentlemen of the



Assembly were gentlemen still, and one of them, Mr.



Memminger, formerly Secretary of the Treasury of the



Confederate States, was especially courteous to us.  But soon



all other things were lost in contemplation of ``Mr.



Speaker.''  He was a bright, nimble, voluble mulatto who,



as one of the Southern gentlemen informed me, was ``the



smartest nigger God ever made.''  Having been elevated



to the speakership, he magnified his office.  While we were



observing him, a gentleman of one of the most historic



families of South Carolina, a family which had given to



the State a long line of military commanders, governors,



senators, and ambassadors, rose to make a motion.  The



speaker, a former slave, at once declared him out of order. 



On the member persisting in his effort, the speaker called



out, ``De genlemun frum Bufert has no right to de floh;



de genlemun from Bufert will take his seat,'' and the



former aristocrat obeyed.  To this it had come at last. 



In the presence of this assembly, in this hall where dis-



union really had its birth, where secession first shone out



in all its glory, a former slave ordered a former master



to sit down, and was obeyed.







In Charleston the same state of things was to be seen,



and for the first time I began to feel sympathy for



the South.  This feeling was deepened by what I saw in



Georgia and Florida; and yet, below it all I seemed to see



the hand of God in history, and in the midst of it all I



seemed to hear a deep voice from the dead.  To me, seeing



these things, there came, reverberating out of the last



century, that prediction of Thomas Jefferson,--himself a



slaveholder,--who, after depicting the offenses of slavery,



ended with these words, worthy of Isaiah,--divinely inspired



if any ever were:--``I tremble when I remember



that God is just.''















CHAPTER XI







GRANT, HAYES, AND GARFIELD--1871-1881







At various times after the death of Mr. Lincoln I visited



Washington, meeting many men especially influential,



and, first of all, President Grant.  Of all personages whom



I then met he impressed me most strongly.  At various



times I talked with him at the White House, dining with



him and seeing him occasionally in his lighter mood, but



at no time was there the slightest diminution of his



unaffected dignity.  Now and then he would make some dry



remark which showed a strong sense of humor, but in



everything there was the same quiet, simple strength.  On



one occasion, when going to the White House, I met Professor



Agassiz of Cambridge, and took him with me: we



were received cordially, General Grant offering us cigars,



as was his wont with visitors, and Agassiz genially



smoking with him: when we had come away the great



naturalist spoke with honest admiration of the President,



evidently impressed by the same qualities which had



always impressed me--his modesty, simplicity, and quiet



force.







I also visited him at various times in his summer



cottage at Long Branch, and on one of these occasions he



gave a bit of history which specially interested me.  As



we were taking coffee after dinner, a card was brought



in, and the President, having glanced at it, said, ``Tell him



that I cannot see him.''  The servant departed with the



message, but soon returned and said, ``The gentleman



wishes to know when he can see the President.''  ``Tell



him NEVER,'' said Grant.







It turned out that the person whose name the card bore



was the correspondent of a newspaper especially noted



for sensation-mongering, and the conversation drifted to



the subject of newspapers and newspaper correspondents,



when the President told the following story, which I give



as nearly as possible in his own words:







``During the hottest period of the final struggle in



Virginia, we suffered very much from the reports of newspaper



correspondents who prowled about our camps and



then put on the wires the information they had gained,



which of course went South as rapidly as it went North. 



It became really serious and embarrassed us greatly.  On



this account, one night, when I had decided to make an



important movement with a portion of the army early



next day, I gave orders that a tent should be pitched in an



out-of-the-way place, at the earliest possible moment in the



morning, and notified the generals who were to take part



in the movement to meet me there.







``It happened that on the previous day there had come



to the camp a newspaper correspondent named ----, and,



as he bore a letter from Mr. Washburne, I treated him as



civilly as possible.







``At daylight next morning, while we were assembled in



the tent making final arrangements, one of my aides,



Colonel ----, heard a noise just outside, and, going out,



saw this correspondent lying down at full length, his ear



under the edge of the tent, and a note-book in his



hand.  Thereupon Colonel took the correspondent



by his other ear, lifted him to his feet, and swore to him



a solemn oath that if he was visible in any part of the



camp more than five minutes longer, a detachment of



troops would be ordered out to shoot him and bury him



there in the swamp, so that no one would ever know his



name or burial-place.







``The correspondent left at once,'' said the President,



``and he took his revenge by writing a history of the war



from which he left me out.''







The same characteristic which I had found at other



meetings with Grant came out even more strongly when,



just before the close of his term, he made me a visit at



Cornell, where one of his sons was a student.  To meet



him I invited several of our professors and others who



were especially prejudiced against him, and, without



exception, they afterward expressed the very feeling which



had come over me after my first conversation with him--



surprise at the revelation of his quiet strength and his



knowledge of public questions then before the country.







During a walk on the university grounds he spoke to me



of the Santo Domingo matter.[3]  He said:  ``The annexation



question is doubtless laid aside for the present, but the time



will come when the country will have occasion to regret



that it was disposed of without adequate discussion.  As I



am so soon to leave the presidency, I may say to you now



that one of my main thoughts in regard to the annexation



of the island has been that it might afford a refuge for the



negroes of the South in case anything like a war of races



should ever arise in the old slave States.''  He then alluded



to the bitter feeling between the two races which was then



shown in the South, and which was leading many of the



blacks to take refuge in Kansas and other northwestern



States, and said, ``If such a refuge as Santo Domingo



were open to them, their former masters would soon find



that they have not the colored population entirely at their



mercy, and would be obliged to compromise with them on



far more just terms than would otherwise be likely.''











[3] See my chapter on Santo Domingo experiences.















The President said this with evidently deep conviction,



and it seemed to me a very thoughtful and far-sighted



view of the possibilities and even probabilities involved.







During another walk, in speaking of the approaching



close of his second presidential term, he said that he found



himself looking forward to it with the same longing which



he had formerly had as a cadet at West Point when looking



forward to a furlough.







I have never believed that the earnest effort made by



his friends at Chicago to nominate him for a third term



was really prompted by him, or that he originally desired



it.  It always seemed to me due to the devotion of friends



who admired his noble qualities, and thought that the



United States ought not to be deprived of them in obedience



to a tradition, in this case, more honored in the



breach than in the observance.







I may add here that, having seen him on several



convivial occasions, and under circumstances when, if ever,



he would be likely to indulge in what was understood to



have been, in his early life, an unfortunate habit, I never



saw him betray the influence of alcohol in the slightest



degree.







Shortly after General Grant laid down his high office,



he made his well-known journey to Europe and the East,



and I had the pleasure of meeting him at Cologne and



traveling up the Rhine with him.  We discussed American



affairs all day long.  He had during the previous week



been welcomed most cordially to the hospitalities of two



leading sovereigns of Europe, and had received endless



attentions from the most distinguished men of England



and Belgium, but in conversation he never, in the slightest



degree, referred to any of these experiences.  He seemed



not to think of them; his heart was in matters pertaining



to his own country.  He told me much regarding his



administration, and especially spoke with the greatest



respect and affection of his Secretary of State, Mr.



Hamilton Fish.







Somewhat later I again met him in Paris, had several



walks and talks with him in which he discussed American



affairs, and I remember that he dwelt with especial



admiration, and even affection, upon his colleagues Sherman



and Sheridan.







I trust that it may not be considered out of place if, in



this retrospect, which is intended, first of all, for my



children and grandchildren, I state that a personal fact,



which was known to many from other sources, was confirmed



to me in one of these conversations:  General Grant



informing me, as he had previously informed my wife, that



he had fully purposed to name me as Secretary of State



had Mr. Fish carried out his intention of resigning.  When



he told me this, my answer was that I considered it a very



fortunate escape for us both; that my training had not



fitted me for such duties; that my experience in the diplomatic



service had then been slight; that I had no proper



training as a lawyer; that my knowledge of international



law was derived far more from the reading of books than



from its application; and that I doubted my physical ability



to bear the pressure for patronage which converged



upon the head of the President's cabinet.







In the Washington of those days my memory also recalls



vividly a dinner with Senator Conkling at which I



met a number of interesting men, and among them Governor



Seymour, who had been the candidate opposed to



Grant during his first presidential campaign; Senator



Anthony, Senator Edmunds, the former Vice-President



Mr. Hamlin, Senator Carpenter, and others.  Many good



stories were told, and one amused me especially, as it was



given with admirable mimicry by Senator Carpenter.  He



described an old friend of his, a lawyer, who, coming



before one of the higher courts with a very doubtful case,



began his plea as follows:  ``May it please the court, there



is only one point in this case favorable to my client, but



that, may it please the court, is a chink in the common law



which has been worn smooth by the multitude of scoundrels



who have escaped through it.''







During the year 1878 I was sent as an honorary



commissioner from the State of New York to the Paris



Exposition, and shall give a more full account of this period in



another chapter.  Suffice it that, having on my return



prepared my official report on the provision for political



education made by the different governments of Europe,



I became more absorbed than ever in university affairs,



keeping aloof as much as possible from politics.  But in



the political campaign of 1878 I could not but be



interested.  It was different from any other that I had known,



for the ``Greenback Craze'' bloomed out as never before



and seemed likely to poison the whole country.  Great



hardships had arisen from the fact that debts which had



been made under a depreciated currency had to be paid



in money of greater value.  Men who, in what were known



as ``flush times,'' had bought farms, paid down half



the price, and mortgaged them for the other half, found



now, when their mortgages became due, that they could



not sell the property for enough to cover the lien upon it. 



Besides this, the great army of speculators throughout



the country found the constant depreciation of prices



bringing them to bankruptcy.  In the cry for more greenbacks,--



that is, for continued issues of paper money,--



demagogism undoubtedly had a large part; but there were



many excellent men who were influenced by it, and among



them Peter Cooper of New York, founder of the great



institution which bears his name, one of the purest and



best men I have ever known.







This cry for more currency was echoed from one end



of the country to the other.  In various States, and



especially in Ohio, it seemed to carry everything before it,



nearly all the public men of note, including nearly all the



leading Democrats and very many of the foremost Republicans,



bowing down to it, the main exceptions being John



Sherman and Garfield.







In central New York the mania seemed, early in the



summer, to take strong hold.  In Syracuse John Wieting, an



amazingly fluent speaker with much popular humor, who



had never before shown any interest in politics, took the



stump for an unlimited issue of government paper currency,



received the nomination to Congress from the



Democrats and sundry independent organizations, and



for a time seemed to carry everything before him.  A



similar state of things prevailed at Ithaca and the region



round about Cayuga Lake.  Two or three people much



respected in the community came out for this doctrine,



and, having a press under their control, their influence



seemed likely to be serious.  Managers of the Republican



organization in the State seemed at first apathetic; but at



last they became alarmed and sent two speakers through



these disaffected districts--only two, but each, in his way,



a master.  The first of them, in order of time, was Senator



Roscoe Conkling, and he took as his subject the National



Banking System.  This had been for a considerable time



one of the objects of special attack by uneasy and unsuccessful



people throughout the entire country.  As a matter



of fact, the national banking system, created during the



Civil War by Secretary Chase and his advisers, was one of



the most admirable expedients ever devised in any country. 



Up to the time of its establishment the whole country



had suffered enormously from the wretched currency



supplied from the State banks.  Even in those States where



the greatest precaution was taken to insure its redemption



all of it was, in time of crisis or panic, fluctuating and much



of it worthless.  But in other States the case was even



worse.  I can recall perfectly that through my boyhood



and young manhood every merchant and shopkeeper kept



on his table what was called a ``bank-note detector,''



which, when any money was tendered him, he was obliged



to consult in order to know, first, whether the bill was a



counterfeit, as it frequently was; secondly, whether it was



on a solvent bank; and thirdly, if good, what discount



should be deducted from the face of it.  Under this system



bank-notes varied in value from week to week, and even



from day to day, with the result that all buying and selling



became a sort of gambling.







When, then, Mr. Chase established the new system of



national banks so based that every bill-holder had security



for the entire amount which his note represented, so



controlled that a bill issued from any little bank in the



remotest State, or even in the remotest corner of a Territory,



was equal to one issued by the richest bank in Wall



Street, so engraved that counterfeiting was practically



impossible, there was an immense gain to every man, woman,



and child in the country.







To appreciate this gain one must have had experience



of the older system.  I remember well the panic of 1857,



which arose while I was traveling in eastern and northern



New England, and that, arriving in the city of Salem,



Massachusetts, having tendered, in payment of my hotel



bill, notes issued by a leading New York city bank,



guaranteed under what was known as the ``Safety Fund



System,'' they were refused.  The result was that I had to



leave my wife at the hotel, go to Boston, and there manage



to get Massachusetts money.







But this was far short of the worst.  Professor Roberts



of Cornell University once told me that, having in those



days collected a considerable debt in one of the Western



States, he found the currency so worthless that he



attempted to secure New York funds, but that the rate of



exchange was so enormous that, as the only way of saving



anything, he bought a large quantity of cheap clothing,



shipped it to the East, and sold it for what it would bring.







As to the way in which the older banking operations



were carried on in some of the Western States, Governor



Felch of Michigan once gave me some of his experiences



as a bank examiner, and one of them especially



amused me.  He said that he and a brother examiner made



an excursion through the State in a sleigh with a pair of



good horses in order to inspect the various banks



established in remote villages and hamlets which had the power



of issuing currency based upon the specie contained in



their vaults.  After visiting a few of these, and finding



that each had the amount of specie required by law, the



examiners began to note a curious similarity between the



specie packages in these different banks, and before long



their attention was drawn to another curious fact, which



was that wherever they went they were preceded by a



sleigh drawn by especially fleet horses.  On making a



careful examination, they found that this sleigh bore from



bank to bank a number of kegs of specie sufficient to enable



each bank in its turn to show the examiners a temporary



basis in hard money for its output of paper.







Such was the state of things which the national banks



remedied, and the system had the additional advantage of



being elastic, so that any little community which needed



currency had only to combine its surplus capital and



establish a bank of issue.







But throughout the country there were, as there will



doubtless always be, a considerable number of men who, not



being able to succeed themselves, distrusted and disliked



the successful.  There was also a plentiful supply of



demagogues skilful in appealing to the prejudices of the



ignorant, envious, or perverse, and as a result came a cry



against the national banks.







In Mr. Conkling's Ithaca speech (1878), he argued the



question with great ability and force.  He had a sledge-



hammer way which broke down all opposition, and he exulted



in it.  One of his favorite tactics, which greatly



amused his auditors, was to lead some prominent gainsayer



in his audience to interrupt him, whereupon, in the blandest



way possible, he would invite him to come forward, urge



him to present his views, even help him to do so, and then,



having gradually entangled him in his own sophistries and



made him ridiculous, the senator would come down upon



him with arguments--cogent, pithy, sarcastic--much like



the fist of a giant upon a mosquito.







In whatever town Mr. Conkling argued the question of



the national banks, that subject ceased to be a factor in



politics: it was settled; his attacks upon the anti-bank



demagogues annihilated their arguments among thinking



men, and his sarcasm made them ridiculous among



unthinking men.  This was the sort of thing which he did



best.  While utterly deficient in constructive power, his



destructive force was great indeed, and in this campaign it



was applied, as it was not always applied, for the advantage



of the country.







The other great speaker in the campaign was General



James A. Garfield, then a member of the House of Repre-



sentatives.  My acquaintance with him had begun several



years before at Syracuse, when my old school friend, his



college mate, Charles Elliot Fitch, brought him into my



library.  My collection of books was even at that date very



large, and Garfield, being delighted with it, soon revealed



his scholarly qualities.  It happened that not long before



this I had bought in London several hundred volumes from



the library left by the historian Buckle, very many of them



bearing copious annotations in his own hand.  Garfield



had read Buckle's ``History of Civilization in England''



with especial interest, and when I presented to him and



discussed with him some of these annotated volumes, there



began a friendly relation between us which ended only



with his life.







I also met him under less favorable circumstances. 



Happening to be in Washington at the revelation of the



Cr<e'>dit Mobilier operations, I found him in the House of



Representatives, and evidently in the depths of suffering. 



An effort was making to connect him with the scandal, and



while everything I know of him convinces me that he was



not dishonest, he had certainly been imprudent.  This he



felt, and he asked me, in an almost heart-broken tone, if



I really believed that this had forever destroyed his



influence in the country.  I answered that I believed nothing



of the kind; that if he came out in a straightforward,



manly way, without any of the prevarication which had so



greatly harmed some others, he would not be injured, and



the result showed that this advice was good.







On our arrival at the great hall in Ithaca (October 28,



1878), we found floor and stage packed in every part. 



Never had a speaker a better audience.  There were present



very many men of all parties anxious to hear the currency



question honestly discussed, and among them many of the



more thoughtful sort misled by the idea that a wrong had



been done to the country in the restoration of the currency



to a sound basis; and there was an enormous attendance



of students from the university.







As Garfield began he showed the effects of fatigue from



the many speeches he had been making for weeks,--morning,



noon, and night; but soon he threw himself heartily



into the subject, and of all the thousands of political



speeches I have heard it was the most effective.  It was



eloquent, but it was far more than that; it was HONESTLY



argumentative; there was no sophistry of any sort; every



subject was taken up fairly and every point dealt with



thoroughly.  One could see the supports of the Greenback



party vanishing as he went on.  His manner was the very



opposite of Mr. Conkling's: it was kindly, hearty, as of



neighbor with neighbor,--indeed, every person present,



even if greenbacker or demagogue, must have said within



himself, ``This man is a friend arguing with friends; he



makes me his friend, and now speaks to me as such.''







The main line of his argument finished, there came



something even finer; for, inspired by the presence of the great



mass of students, he ended his speech with an especial



appeal to them.  Taking as his test the noted passage in



the letter written by Macaulay to Henry Randall, the biographer



of Jefferson,--the letter in which Macaulay prophesied



destruction to the American Republic when poverty



should pinch and discontent be wide-spread in the country,



--he appealed to these young men to see to it that this



prophecy should not come true; he asked them to follow in



this, as in similar questions, their reason and not their



prejudices, and from this he went on with a statement of



the motives which ought to govern them and the line they



ought to pursue in the effort to redeem their country.







Never was speech more successful.  It carried the entire



audience, and left in that region hardly a shred of the



greenback theory.  When the election took place it was



observed that in those districts where Conkling and Garfield



had spoken, the greenback heresy was annihilated, while



in other districts which had been counted as absolutely sure



for the Republican party, and to which, therefore, these



orators had not been sent, there was a great increase in



the vote for currency inflation.







I have often alluded to this result as an answer to those



who say that speaking produces no real effect on the



convictions of men regarding party matters.  Some speaking



does not, but there is a kind of speaking which does, and



of this were these two masterpieces, so different from



each other in matter and manner, and yet converging



upon the same points, intellectual and moral.







Before I close regarding Garfield, it may be well to give



a few more recollections of him.  The meeting ended, we



drove to my house on the university grounds, and shortly



before our arrival he asked me, ``How did you like my



speech?''  I answered:  ``Garfield, I have known you too



long and think too highly of you to flatter you; but I will



simply say what I would say under oath: it was the best



speech I ever heard.  ``This utterance of mine was deliberate,



expressing my conviction, and he was evidently



pleased with it.







Having settled down in front of the fire in my library,



we began to discuss the political situation, and his talk



remains to me among the most interesting things of my



life.  He said much regarding the history of the currency



question and his relations to it, and from this ran rapidly



and suggestively through a multitude of other questions



and the relations of public men to them.  One thing which



struck me was his judicially fair and even kindly estimates



of men who differed from him.  Very rarely did he speak



harshly or sharply of any one, differing in this greatly



from Mr. Conkling, who, in all his conversations, and



especially in one at that same house not long before, seemed



to consider men who differed from him as enemies of the



human race.







Under Mr. Hayes, the successor of General Grant in the



Presidency, I served first as a commissioner at the Paris



Exposition, and then as minister to Germany.  Both these



services will be discussed in the chapters relating to my



diplomatic life, but I may refer briefly to my acquaintance



with him at this period.







I had met him but once previously, and that was during



his membership of Congress when he came to enter his son



at Cornell.  I had then been most favorably impressed by



his large, sincere, manly way.  On visiting Washington to



receive my instructions before going to Berlin, I saw him



several times, and at each meeting my respect for him was



increased.  Driving to Arlington, walking among the soldiers'



graves there, standing in the portico of General Lee's



former residence, and viewing from the terrace the Capitol



in the distance, he spoke very nobly of the history we had



both personally known, of the sacrifices it had required,



and of the duties which it now imposed.  At his dinner-



table I heard him discuss with his Secretary of State, Mr.



Evarts, a very interesting question--the advisability of



giving members of the cabinet seats in the Senate and



House of Representatives, as had been arranged in the



constitution of the so-called Confederate States; but of



this I shall speak in another chapter.







It should further be said regarding Mr. Hayes that, while



hardly any President was ever so systematically denounced



and depreciated, he was one of the truest and best men



who has ever held our Chief Magistracy.  I remember,



just at the close of his administration, dining with an



eminent German statesman who said to me:  ``I have



watched the course of your President with more and



more surprise.  We have been seeing constantly in our



German newspapers extracts from American journals



holding up your President to contempt as an ignoramus,



but more and more I have seen that he is one of the most



substantial, honest, and capable Presidents that you have



had.''







This opinion was amply justified by what I saw of Mr.



Hayes after the close of his Presidency.  Twice I met him



during conferences at Lake Mohonk, at which matters



relating to the improvement of the freedmen and Indians



were discussed, and in each he took broad, strong, and



statesmanlike views based on thoughtful experience and



permeated by honesty.







I also met him at a great public meeting at Cleveland,



where we addressed some four thousand people from the



same platform, and again I was impressed by his manly,



far-seeing grasp of public questions.







As to my after relations with Garfield, I might speak of



various pleasant interviews, but will allude to just one



incident which has a pathetic side.  During my first residence



in Germany as minister of the United States, I one day



received a letter from him asking me to secure for him the



best editions of certain leading Greek and Latin classics,



adding that it had long been his earnest desire to re-read



them, and that now, as he had been elected to the United



States Senate, he should have leisure to carry out his



purpose.  I had hardly sent him what he desired when the



news came that he had been nominated to the Presidency,



and so all his dream of literary leisure vanished.  A few



months later came the news of his assassination.







My term of service as minister in Berlin being ended, I



arrived in America in September, 1881, and, in accordance



with custom, went to present my respects to the new President



and his Secretary of State.  They were both at Long



Branch.  Mr. Blaine I saw and had with him a very interesting



conversation, but President Garfield I could not see. 



His life was fast ebbing out, and a week later, on Sunday



morning, I heard the bells tolling and knew that his last



struggle was over.







So closed a career which, in spite of some defects, was



beautiful and noble.  Great hopes had been formed regarding



his Presidency, and yet, on looking back over his life,



I have a strong feeling that his assassination was a service



rendered to his reputation.  I know from those who had



full information that during his campaign for the Presidency



he had been forced to make concessions and pledges



which would have brought great trouble upon him had he



lived through his official term.  Gifted and good as he



was, advantage had been taken of his kindly qualities, and



he would have had to pay the penalty.







It costs me a pang to confess my opinion that the



administration of Mr. Arthur, a man infinitely his inferior in



nearly all the qualities which men most justly admire, was



far better than the administration which Mr Garfield



would have been allowed to give to the country.







Upon my return to the university I was asked by my



fellow-citizens of Ithaca in general, as also by the university



faculty and students, to give the public address at the



celebration of President Garfield's funeral.  This I did



and never with a deeper feeling of loss.







One thing in the various tributes to him had struck me



painfully:  Throughout the whole country his career was



constantly referred to in funeral addresses as showing



how a young American under all the disadvantages of



poverty could rise to the highest possible position.  I have



always thought that such statements, as they are usually



presented, are injurious to the character and lowering to



the aspirations of young men.  I took pains, therefore, to



show that while Garfield had risen under the most



discouraging circumstances from complete poverty, his rise



was due to something other than mere talent and exertion



--that it was the result of talent and exertion originating



in noble instincts and directed to worthy ends.  Garfield's



life proves this abundantly, and whatever may have been



his temporary weakness under the fearful pressure



brought upon him toward the end of his career, these



instincts and purposes remained his main guiding influences



from first to last.















CHAPTER XII







ARTHUR, CLEVELAND, AND BLAINE--1881-1884







The successor of Garfield, President Arthur, I had met



frequently in my old days at Albany.  He was able,



and there never was the slightest spot upon his integrity;



but in those early days nobody dreamed that he was to



attain any high distinction.  He was at that time charged



with the main military duties under the governor; later he



became collector of the port of New York, and in both



positions showed himself honest and capable.  He was lively,



jocose, easy-going, with little appearance of devotion to



work, dashing off whatever he had to do with ease and



accuracy.  At various dinner-parties and social gatherings,



and indeed at sundry State conventions, where I met



him, he seemed, more than anything else, a bon vivant,



facile and good-natured.







His nomination to the Vice-Presidency, which on the



death of Garfield led him to the Presidency, was very curious,



and an account of it given me by an old friend who



had previously been a member of the Garfield cabinet and



later an ambassador in Europe, was as follows:







After the defeat of the ``Stalwarts,'' who had fought



so desperately for the renomination of General Grant at



the Chicago Convention of 1880, the victorious side of the



convention determined to concede to them, as an olive-



branch, the Vice-Presidency, and with this intent my



informant and a number of other delegates who had been



especially active in preventing Grant's renomination went



to the room of the New York delegation, which had



taken the leading part in his support, knocked at the door,



and called for Mr. Levi P. Morton, previously a member



of Congress, and, several years later, Vice-President of



the United States and Governor of New York.  Mr. Morton



came out into the corridor, and thereupon the visitors said



to him, ``We wish to give the Vice-Presidency to New York



as a token of good will, and you are the man who should



take it; don't fail to accept it.''  Mr. Morton answered



that he had but a moment before, in this conference



of his delegation, declined the nomination.  At this the



visitors said, ``Go back instantly and tell them that you



have reconsidered and will accept; we will see that the



convention nominates you.''  Mr. Morton started to follow



this advice, but was just too late: while he was outside the



door he had been taken at his word, the place which he



had declined had been offered to General Arthur, he had



accepted it, and so the latter and not Mr. Morton became



President of the United States.







Up to the time when the Presidency devolved upon him,



General Arthur had shown no qualities which would have



suggested him for that high office, and I remember vividly



that when the news of Garfield's assassination arrived



in Berlin, where I was then living as minister, my



first overwhelming feeling was not, as I should have



expected, horror at the death of Garfield, but stupefaction



at the elevation of Arthur.  It was a common saying of



that time among those who knew him best, `` `Chet' Arthur



President of the United States!  Good God!''  But the



change in him on taking the Presidency was amazing.  Up



to that time he had been known as one of Mr. Conkling's



henchmen, though of the better sort.  As such he had held



the collectorship of the port of New York, and as such,



during his occupancy of the Vice-Presidency, he had



visited Albany and done his best, though in vain, to secure



Mr. Conkling's renomination; but immediately on his elevation



to the Presidency all this was changed, and there is



excellent authority for the statement that when Mr. Conkling



wished him to continue, as President, in the subservient 



position which he had taken as Vice-President, Mr.



Arthur had refused, and when taxed with ingratitude he



said:  ``No.  For the Vice-Presidency I was indebted to



Mr. Conkling, but for the Presidency of the United States



my debt is to the Almighty.''







The new President certainly showed this spirit in his



actions.  Rarely has there been a better or more dignified



administration; the new Secretary of State, Mr. Frelinghuysen,



was in every respect fitted for his office, and the other men



whom Mr. Arthur summoned about him were satisfactory.







Although I had met him frequently, and indeed was on



cordial terms with him before his elevation to the



Presidency, I never met him afterward.  During his whole



administration my duties in connection with Cornell



University completely absorbed me.  I was one of the last



university presidents who endeavored to unite professorial



with executive duties, and the burden was heavy. 



The university had made at that period its first great



sale of lands, and this involved a large extension of



its activity; the famous Fiske lawsuit, involving nearly



two millions of dollars, had come on; there was every



sort of detail requiring attention at the university



itself, and addresses must be given in various parts of



the country, more especially before alumni associations,



to keep them in proper relations with the institution;



so that I was kept completely out of politics, was hardly



ever in Washington during this period, and never at the



White House.







The only matter which connected me with politics at all



was my conviction, which deepened more and more, as



to the necessity of reform in the civil service; and on this



subject I conferred with Mr. Dorman B. Eaton, Mr. John



Jay, and others at various times, and prepared an article



for the ``North American Review'' in which I presented



not only the general advantages of civil service reform,



but its claims upon men holding public office.  My main



effort was to show, what I believed then and believe still



more strongly now, that, evil as the whole spoils system



was in its effects on the country, it was quite as vexatious



and fertile in miseries and disappointments to political



leaders.  In the natural order of things, where there is no



spoils system, and where the bestowal of offices is not in the



hands of senators, representatives, and the like, these



senators and representatives, when once elected, have time to



discharge their duties, and with very little pains can



maintain their hold upon their constituents as long as they



please.  The average man, when he has cast his vote for a



candidate and sees that candidate elected, takes an interest



in him; the voter, feeling that he has, in a certain sense,



made an investment in the man thus elected, is naturally



inclined to regard him favorably and to continue him in



office.  But with the spoils system, no sooner is a candidate



elected than, as has been well observed, for every office



which he bestows he makes ``ninety-nine enemies and one



ingrate.''  The result is that the unsuccessful candidates



for appointment return home bent on taking revenge by



electing another person at the end of the present incumbent's



term, and hence comes mainly the wretched system



of rapid rotation in office, which has been in so many



ways injurious to our country.







This and other points I urged, but the evil was too



deeply seated.  Time was required to remove all doubts



which were raised.  I found with regret that my article



had especially incurred the bitter dislike of my old adviser,



Thurlow Weed, the great friend of Mr. Seward and former



autocrat of Whig and Republican parties in the State of



New York.  Being entirely of the old school, he could not



imagine the government carried on without the spoils system.







On one of my visits to New York in the interest of this



reform, I met at dinner Mr. William M. Evarts, then at the



head of the American bar, who had been Secretary of



State under Mr. Hayes, and who was afterward senator



from the State of New York.  I had met him frequently



before and heard much of his brilliant talk, and especially



his admirable stories of all sorts.







But on this occasion Mr. Evarts surpassed himself.  I



recall a series of witty repartees and charming illustrations,



but will give merely one of the latter.  Something



was said of people's hobbies, whereupon Mr. Evarts said



that a gentleman visiting a lunatic asylum went into a



room where several patients were assembled, and saw one



of them astride a great dressing-trunk, holding fast to a



rope drawn through the handle, seesawing and urging it



forward as if it were a horse at full speed.  The visitor,



to humor the patient, said, ``That 's a fine horse you



are riding.''  ``Why, no,'' said the patient, ``this is not



a horse.''  ``What is it, then?'' asked the visitor.  The



patient answered, ``It 's a hobby.''  ``But,'' said the



visitor, ``what 's the difference between a horse and a



hobby?''  ``Why,'' said the patient, ``there 's an enormous



difference; a horse you can get off from, a hobby



you can't.''







As to civil-service reform, my efforts to convert leading



Republicans by personal appeals were continued, and in



some cases with good results; but I found it very difficult



to induce party leaders to give up the immediate and direct



exercise of power which the spoils system gave them. 



Especially was it difficult with sundry editors of leading



papers and party managers; but time has wrought upon



them, and some of those who were most obdurate in those



days are doing admirable work in these.  The most serious



effort I ever made was to convert my old friend and classmate,



Thomas C. Platt, the main manager and, as he



was called, the ``boss'' of the Republican party in the



State of New York, a man of great influence throughout



the Union.  He treated me civilly, but evidently considered



me a ``crank.''  He, like Mr. Thurlow Weed, was



unable to understand how a party could be conducted



without the promise of spoils for the victors; but I have



lived to see him take a better view.  As I write these lines



word comes that his influence is thrown in favor of the bill



for reforming the civil service of the State of New York,



championed by my nephew, Mr. Horace White, a member



of the present State Senate, and favored by Colonel Roosevelt,



the governor.







It was upon a civil-service errand in Philadelphia that



I met, after a long separation, my old friend and classmate



Wayne MacVeagh.  He had been minister to Constantinople,



Attorney-General in the Garfield cabinet, and, at a



later period, ambassador at Rome.  At this period he had



returned to practise his profession in Philadelphia, and at



his hospitable table I met a number of interesting men,



and on one occasion sat next an eminent member of



the Philadelphia bar, Judge Biddle.  A subject happened



to come up in which I had taken great interest, namely,



American laxity in the punishment of crime, and especially



the crime of murder, whereupon Judge Biddle dryly remarked: 



``The taking of life, after due process of law, as



a penalty for murder, seems to be the only form of taking



life to which the average American has any objection.''







In the autumn of 1882 came a tremendous reverse for



the Republican party.  There was very wide-spread disgust



at the apparent carelessness of those in power regarding



the redemption of pledges for reforms.  Judge Folger,



who had been nominated to the governorship of New



York, had every qualification for the place, but an opinion



had widely gained ground that President Arthur, who had



called Judge Folger into his cabinet as Secretary of the



Treasury, was endeavoring to interfere with the politics



of the State, and to put Judge Folger into the governor's



chair.  There was a suspicion that ``the machine'' was



working too easily and that some of its wheels were of a



very bad sort.  All this, coupled with slowness in redeeming



platform pledges, brought on the greatest disaster the



Republican party had ever experienced.  In November,



1882, Mr. Cleveland was elected governor by the most



enormous majority ever known, and the defeat extended



not only through the State of New York, but through a



number of other States.  It was bitter medicine, but, as it



afterward turned out, very salutary.







Just after this election, being in New York to deliver an



address before the Geographical Society on the subject of



``The New Germany'' (December 27, 1882), I met a number



of distinguished men in politics at the table of General



Cullom, formerly the head of the West Point Academy. 



There was much interesting talk, and some significant



political facts were brought out; but the man who interested



me most was my next neighbor at table, General McDowell.







He was an old West Pointer, and had planned the



first battle of Bull Run, when our troops were overwhelmingly



defeated, the capital put in peril, and the



nation humiliated at home and abroad.  There is no



doubt now that McDowell's plans were excellent, but



the troops were raw volunteers, with little knowledge of



their officers and less confidence in them; and, as a



result, when, like the men in the ``Biglow Papers,'' they



found ``why bagonets is peaked,'' there was a panic, just



as there was in the first battles of the French Revolution. 



Every man distrusted every other man; there was a general



outcry, and all took flight.  I remember doing what



I could in those days to encourage those who looked with



despair on the flight from the battle-field of Bull Run, by



pointing out to them exactly similar panics and flights



in the first battles of the soldiers who afterward became



the Grande Arm<e'>e and marched triumphantly over Europe.







But of one thing the American people felt certain in



those days, and that was that at Bull Run ``General



McDowell was drunk.''  This assertion was loudly made,



widely spread, never contradicted, and generally believed. 



I must confess now with shame that I was one of those who



were so simple-minded as to take this newspaper story as



true.  On this occasion, sitting next General McDowell, I



noticed that he drank only water, taking no wine of any



sort; and on my calling his attention to the wines of our



host as famous, he answered, ``No doubt; but I never take



anything but water.''  I answered, ``General, how long has



that been your rule?''  He replied, ``Always since my boy-



hood.  At that time I was sent to a military school at



Troyes in France, and they gave us so much sour wine



that I vowed that if I ever reached America again no



drink but water should ever pass my lips, and I have kept



to that resolution.''







Of course this was an enormous surprise to me, but



shortly afterward I asked various army officers regarding



the matter, and their general answer was:  ``Why, of



course; all of us know that McDowell is the only officer



in the army who never takes anything but water.''







And this was the man who was widely believed by



the American people to have lost the battle of Bull Run



because he was drunk!







Another remembrance of this period is a dinner with



Mr. George Jones, of the ``New York Times,'' who gave



me a full account of the way in which his paper came into



possession of the documents revealing the Tammany



frauds, and how, despite enormous bribes and bitter



threats, the ``Times'' persisted in publishing the papers,



and so brought the Tweed r<e'>gime to destruction.







Of political men, the most noted whom I met in those



days was Governor Cleveland.  He was little known, but



those of us who had been observant of public affairs knew



that he had shown sturdy honesty and courage, first as



sheriff of the county of Erie, and next as mayor of Buffalo,



and that, most wonderful of all, he had risen above party



ties and had appointed to office the best men he could find,



even when some of them were earnest Republicans.







In June of 1883 he visited the university as an ex-officio



trustee, laid the corner-stone of the chapel above the



remains of Ezra Cornell, and gave a brief address.  It was



short, but surprised me by its lucidity and force.  This



being done, I conducted him to the opening of the new



chemical laboratory.  He was greatly interested in it, and



it was almost pathetic to note his evident regret that he



had never had the advantage of such instruction.  I



learned afterward that he was classically prepared to enter



college, but that his father, a poor country clergyman,



being unable to defray his expenses, the young man



determined to strike out for himself, and so began one of



the best careers known in the history of American politics.







At this same commencement of Cornell University



appeared another statesman, Justin S. Morrill of Vermont,



author of the Morrill Bill of 1862, which, by a grant of



public lands, established a college for scientific, technical,



military, and general education in every State and Territory



in the Union.  It was one of the most beneficent



measures ever proposed in any country.  Mr. Morrill had



made a desperate struggle for his bill, first as representative



and afterward as senator.  It was twice vetoed by



President Buchanan, who had at his back all the pro-slavery



doctrinaires of his time.  They distrusted, on various



accounts, any system for promoting advanced education,



and especially for its promotion by the government; but



he won the day, and on this occasion our trustees, at my



suggestion, invited him to be present at the unveiling of



his portrait by Huntington, which had been painted by



order of the trustees for the library.







He was evidently gratified at the tribute, and all who



met him were pleased with him.  The time will come, I



trust, when his statue will stand in the capital of the Union



as a memorial of one of the most useful and far-seeing



statesmen our country has known.







A week later I addressed my class at Yale on ``The



Message of the Nineteenth Century to the Twentieth.''  In



this address my endeavor was to indicate the lines on which



reforms of various sorts must be instituted, and along



which a better future for the country could be developed,



and it proved a far greater success than I had expected. 



It was widely circulated in various forms, first in the



newspapers, then as a pamphlet, and finally as a kind of



campaign document.







From July to September of that year (1883) I was



obliged to be in Europe looking after matters pertaining



to the university lawsuit, and, on returning, was called



upon to address a large meeting of Germans at the funeral



of a member of the German parliament who had



died suddenly while on a visit to our country--Edward



Lasker.  I had known him well in Berlin as a man of



great ability and high character, and felt it a duty to



accept the invitation to give one of the addresses at



his funeral.  The other address was given by my friend



of many years, Carl Schurz; and these addresses, with



some others made at the time, did, I suppose, something



to bring to me the favor of my German fellow-citizens in



New York.







Still, my main thoughts were given to Cornell University. 



This was so evident that on one occasion a newspaper



of my own party, in an article hostile to those who spoke



of nominating me for the governorship, declared:  ``Mr.



White's politics and religion are Cornell University.'' 



But suddenly, in 1884, I was plunged into politics most



unexpectedly.







As has been usual with every party in the State of New



York from the beginning of the government, the Republicans



were divided between two factions, one supporting



Mr. Arthur for the Presidency, the other hoping to nominate



Mr. Blaine.  These two factions thus standing opposed



to each other, Mr. Theodore Roosevelt, with a few



others in various parts of the State, started an independent



movement, with the result that the two main divisions of



the party, detesting each other more than they detested the



independents, supported the latter and elected independent



candidates as delegates at large to the approaching



Republican Convention at Chicago.  Without any previous



notice, I was made one of these delegates.  My position was



therefore perfectly independent; I was at liberty to vote



for whom I pleased.  Although my acquaintance with Mr.



Blaine was but slight, I had always felt strong admiration



and deep attachment for him.  As Secretary of State, during



a part of my residence in Berlin, he had stood by



me in a contest regarding the double standard of value



in which I had feared that he might waver; and, far more



than all this, his general political course had caused me,



as it had caused myriads of others, to feel grateful to



him.







But I had learned some things regarding his vulnerability



in a presidential campaign which made me sure



that it would be impossible to elect him.  An impartial



but kindly judge had, some months before, while



expressing great admiration for Mr. Blaine, informed me of



some transactions which, while they showed no turpitude,



revealed a carelessness in doing business which would



certainly be brought to bear upon him with great effect in a



heated political campaign.  It was clear to me that, if



nominated, he would be dragged through the mire, the



Republican party defeated, and the country at large



besmirched in the eyes of the whole world.







Arrived at Chicago June 2, 1884, I found the political



caldron seething and bubbling.  Various candidates



were earnestly supported, and foremost of all, President



Arthur and Mr. Blaine.  The independent delegates,



led by Theodore Roosevelt and George William Curtis,



and the Massachusetts delegation, headed by Governor



Long, Senator Hoar, and Henry Cabot Lodge, decided to



support Senator Edmunds of Vermont.  No man stood



higher than he for integrity as well as for statesmanlike



qualities and legal abilities; no one had more thoroughly



the respect of thinking men from one end of the country



to the other.







The delegates having arrived in the great hall where



the convention was sitting, a number of skirmishes took



place, and a momentary victory was gained by the



Independents in electing, as temporary chairman, a colored



delegate of great ability from one of the Southern States,



over Mr. Powell Clayton of Arkansas, who, though he



had suffered bitterly and struggled bravely to maintain



the Union during the Civil War, was supposed to be identified



with doubtful methods in Southern politics.







But as it soon became evident that the main tide was for



Mr. Blaine, various efforts were made to concentrate the



forces opposed to him upon some candidate who could



command more popular support than Mr. Edmunds.  An



earnest effort was made in favor of John Sherman



of Ohio, and his claims were presented most sympathetically



to me by my old Cornell student, Governor Foraker. 



Of all the candidates before the convention I would have



preferred to vote for Mr. Sherman.  He had borne the



stress of the whole anti-slavery combat, and splendidly;



he had rendered great services to the nation as a statesman



and financier, and was in every respect capable and worthy. 



Unfortunately there were too many old enmities against



him, and it was clear that the anti-Blaine vote could not



be concentrated on him.  My college classmate, Mr.



Knevals of New York, then urged me to vote for President



Arthur.  This, too, would have been a fairly satisfactory



solution of the question, for President Arthur had surprised



every one by the excellence of his administration. 



Still there was a difficulty in his case: the Massachusetts



delegates could not be brought to support him; it was said



that he had given some of their leaders mortal offense



by his hostility to the River and Harbor Bill.  A final



effort was then made by the Independents to induce General



Sherman to serve, but he utterly refused, and so the only



thing left was to let matters take their course.  All chance



of finding any one to maintain the desired standard of



American political life against the supporters of Mr.



Blaine had failed.







As we came into the convention on the morning of the



day fixed for making the nominations, I noticed that the



painted portraits of Washington and Lincoln, previously



on either side of the president's chair, had been removed. 



Owing to the tumultuous conduct of the crowd in the



galleries, it had been found best to remove things of an



ornamental nature from the walls, for some of these



ornaments had been thrown down, to the injury of those



sitting below.







On my calling Curtis's attention to this removal of the



two portraits, he said:  ``Yes, I have noticed it, and I am



glad of it.  Those weary eyes of Lincoln have been upon



us here during our whole stay, and I am glad that they are



not to see the work that is to be done here to-day.''  It was



a curious exhibition of sentiment, a revelation of the deep



poetic feeling which was so essential an element in Curtis's



noble character.







The various candidates were presented by prominent



speakers, and most of the speeches were thoroughly good;



but unquestionably the best, from an oratorical point of



view, was made on the nomination of Mr. Edmunds by



Governor Long of Massachusetts.  Both as to matter and



manner it was perfection; was felt to be so by the convention;



and was sincerely applauded even by the majority



of those who intended to vote for Mr. Blaine.







There was one revelation here, as there had been at



many conventions previously, which could not fail to



produce a discouraging impression upon every thoughtful



American.  The number of delegates and substitutes sent



to the convention amounted in all to a few hundreds, but



these were almost entirely lost in the immense crowd of



spectators, numbering, it was said, from twelve to fifteen



thousand.  In the only conventions which I had ever before



seen, including those at Baltimore and Philadelphia and



various State conventions of New York, the delegates had



formed the majority of those in the hall; but in this great



``wigwam'' there were times in which the most important



part was played by the spectators.  At some moments this



overwhelming mob, which encircled the seats of the delegates



on the floor and rose above them on all sides in the



galleries, endeavored to sweep the convention in the direction



of its own whims and fancies.  From time to time



the convention ceased entirely to be a deliberative body. 



As the names of certain favorite candidates were called, or



as certain popular allusions were made in speeches, this



mob really took possession of the convention and became



almost frantic.  I saw many women jumping up and down,



dishevelled and hysterical, and some men acting in much



the same way.  It was absolutely unworthy of a convention



of any party, a disgrace to decency, and a blot upon



the reputation of our country.  I am not alone in this



opinion.  More than once during my official life in Europe I



have heard the whole thing lamented by leading liberal



statesmen as bringing discredit on all democratic government.







There were times indeed when the galleries sought to



howl down those who were taking part in the convention,



and this was notably the case during a very courageous



speech by Mr. Roosevelt.







I may mention, in passing, that the country then



received the first revelation of that immense pluck and vigor



which have since carried Mr. Roosevelt through so many



political conflicts, borne him through all the dangers of



the Santiago campaign, placed him in the governor's chair



of the State of New York and in the Vice-Presidency of



the United States, leading to the Presidency, which he



holds as I revise these lines.  At the Chicago Convention,



though he was in a small minority, nothing daunted him. 



As he stood upon a bench and addressed the president,



there came from the galleries on all sides a howl and



yell, ``Sit down! sit down!'' with whistling and cat-calls. 



All to no purpose; the mob might as well have tried to



whistle down a bronze statue.  Roosevelt, slight in build



as he then was, was greater than all that crowd combined. 



He stood quietly through it all, defied the mob, and finally



obliged them to listen to him.







Toward the end of the convention this mob showed itself



even worse than before.  It became evident that large



parts of the galleries were packed in the interest of the



local candidate for the Vice-Presidency, General Logan,



and this mass of onlookers did their best to put down all



delegates supporting any other.







No more undemocratic system was ever devised.  The



tendency of this ``wigwam'' plan of holding great meetings



or conventions is to station a vast mob of sensation-



seeking men and women in the galleries between the delegates



and the country at large.  The inevitable consequence



is that the ``fog-horns'' of a convention play the most ef-



fective part, and that they seek mainly the applause of the



galleries.  The country at large is for the moment



forgotten.  The controlling influence is the mob, mainly from



the city where the convention is held.  The whole thing is



a monstrous abuse.  Attention has been called to it by



thinking Democrats as well as by Republicans, who have



seen in it a sign of deterioration which has produced many



unfortunate consequences and will produce more.  It is



the old story of the French Convention overawed by a gallery



mob and mistaking the mob whimsies of a city for the



sober judgment of the country.  One result of it the whole



nation saw when, in more recent years, a youthful member



of Congress, with no training to fit him for executive



duties, was suddenly, by the applause of such a mob,



imposed upon the Democratic National Convention as a



candidate for the Presidency.  Those who recall the way in



which ``the boy orator of the Platte'' became the Democratic



candidate for the Chief Magistracy over seventy



millions of people, on account of a few half-mawkish, half-



blasphemous phrases in a convention speech, can bear



witness to the necessity of a reform in this particular--a



reform which will forbid a sensation-seeking city mob to



usurp the function of the whole people of our Republic.







In spite of these mob hysterics, the Independents



persisted to the last in supporting Mr. Edmunds for the first



place, but in voting for the second place they separated. 



For the Vice-Presidency I cast the only vote which was



thrown for my old Cornell student, Mr. Foraker, previously



governor of Ohio, and since that time senator



from that State.







In spite of sundry ``defects of his qualities,'' which



I freely recognized, I regarded him as a fearless, upright,



downright, straightforward man of the sort who must



always play a great part in American politics.







It was at this convention that I saw for the first time



Mr. McKinley of Ohio, and his quiet self-possession in



the midst of the various whirls and eddies and storms



caused me to admire him greatly.  Calm, substantial, quick



to see a good point, strong to maintain it, he was evidently



a born leader of men.  His speeches were simple, clear,



forcible, and aided at times in rescuing the self-respect



of the body.







This Republican convention having adjourned, the



National Democratic Convention met soon afterward in the



same place and nominated Grover Cleveland of New York. 



He was a man whom I greatly respected.  As already



stated, his career as sheriff of Erie County, as mayor of



Buffalo, and as governor of the State of New York had



led me to admire him.  He had seemed utterly incapable



of making any bid for mob support; there had



appeared not the slightest germ of demagogism in him;



he had refused to be a mere partizan tool and had steadily



stood for the best ideals of government.  As governor



he showed the same qualities which had won admiration



during his previous career as sheriff and mayor.  He



made as many appointments as he could without regard



to political considerations, and it was remarked with



wonder that when a number of leading Democratic ``workers''



and ``wheel-horses'' came to the executive chamber in



Albany in order to dictate purely partizan appointments,



he virtually turned them out of the room.  Most amazing



thing of all, he had vetoed a bill reducing the fare on the



elevated railroads of New York, in the face of the earnest



advice of partizans who assured him that by doing so he



would surely array against him the working-classes of



that city and virtually annihilate his political future. 



To this his answer was that whatever his sympathies for



the working-people might be, he could not, as an honest



man, allow such a bill to pass, and, come what might, he



would not.  He had also dared, quietly but firmly, to resist



the chief ``boss'' of his party in New York City, and he



had consequently to brave the vials of Celtic wrath.  The



scenes at the convention which nominated him were stirring,



and an eminent Western delegate struck a chord in



the hearts of thousands of Republicans as well as



Democrats when he said, ``We love him for the enemies he has



made.''  Had it been a question simply between men, great



numbers of us who voted for Mr. Blaine would have voted



for Mr. Cleveland; but whatever temptation I might be



subjected to in the matter was overcome by one fact:  Mr.



Cleveland was too much like the Trojan horse, for he bore



with him a number of men who, when once brought into



power, were sure to labor hard to undo everything that



he would endeavor to accomplish, and his predestined



successor in the governorship of the State of New York was



one of those whom I looked upon as especially dangerous.







Therefore it was, that, after looking over the ground, I



wrote an open letter to Mr. Theodore Roosevelt and other



Independents, giving the reasons why those of us who had



supported Mr. Edmunds should now support Mr. Blaine,



and in this view Mr. Roosevelt, with a large number of our



Independent friends, agreed.







I had, however, small hopes.  It was clear to me that Mr.



Blaine had little chance of being elected; that, in fact, he



was too heavily weighted with the transactions which Mr.



Pullman had revealed to me some months before the



beginning of the convention.







But I made an effort to commit him to the only policy



which could save him.  For, having returned to the university,



I wrote William Walter Phelps, an old friend, who



had been his chief representative at Chicago, an earnest



letter stating that there seemed to me but one chance of



rallying to Mr. Blaine's support the very considerable



body of disaffected Republicans in the State of New York;



that, almost without exception, they were ardent believers



in a reform of the civil service; and that an out-and-out



earnest declaration in favor of it by our presidential



candidate might do much to propitiate them.  I reminded



Mr. Phelps of the unquestioned evils of the ``spoils



system,'' and said that Mr. Blaine must surely have often



observed them, suffered under pressure from them, and



felt that something should be done to remedy them; and



that if he would now express his conviction to this effect,



taking strong ground in favor of the reform and basing



his utterances on his experiences as a statesman, it would,



in my mind, do much to save the State of New York for



the Republicans.







After writing this letter, feeling that it might seem to



Mr. Phelps and to Mr. Blaine himself very presuming for



a man who had steadily opposed them at Chicago thus to



volunteer advice, I laid it aside.  But it happened that I



had been chosen one of the committee of delegates to go



to Maine to apprise Mr. Blaine formally of his nomination,



and it also happened that my old student and friend,



Judge Foraker, was another member of the committee.  It



was impossible for me to go to Maine, since the commencement



of the university, at which I was bound to preside,



came on the day appointed for Mr. Blaine's reception of



the committee at Bangor; but Judge Foraker having



stopped over at the university to attend a meeting of the



trustees as an alumni member of that body, I mentioned



this letter to him.  He asked to see it, and, having read it,



asked to be allowed to take it with him.  I consented, and



heard nothing more from him on the subject; but the



following week, at the Yale commencement, while sitting with



Mr. Evarts and Judge Shipman to award prizes in the



law department, I saw, looking toward me over the



heads of the audience in the old Centre Church, my



friend Frederick William Holls of New York, and it



was evident from his steady gaze that he had something



to say.  The award of prizes having been made and the



audience dismissed, Mr. Holls met me and said:  ``Mr.



Blaine will adopt your suggestion in his letter of



acceptance.''  Both of us were overjoyed.  It looked like a



point scored not only for the Republican party, but for the



cause which we both had so deeply at heart.







But as the campaign went on it was more and more



evident that this concession, which I believe he would have



adhered to had he been elected, was to be in vain.







It was perhaps, on the whole, and on both sides, the vilest



political campaign ever waged.  Accusations were made



against both candidates which should have forever brought



contempt on the men who made them.  Nothing could have



been further from the wish of either candidate than that



such accusations should be made against his opponent, but



each was powerless: the vile flood of slander raged on. 



But I am glad here to recall the fact that when, at a later



period, one of the worst inventors of slander against Mr.



Blaine sought reward in the shape of office from President



Cleveland, he was indignantly spurned.







In politics I took very little part.  During the summer



my main thoughts were directed toward a controversy before



the Board of Regents, in regard to the system of



higher education in the State of New York, with my



old friend President Anderson of Rochester, who had



vigorously attacked some ideas which seemed to me essential



to any proper development of university education



in America; and this was hardly finished when I was asked



to take part in organizing the American Historical Association



at Saratoga, and to give the opening address.  This,



with other pursuits of an academic nature, left me little



time for the political campaign.







But there occurred one little incident to which I still



look back with amusement.  My old friends and constituents



in Syracuse had sent me a general invitation to



come over from the university and preside at some one



of their Republican mass-meetings.  My answer was that



as to the ``hack speakers'' of the campaign, with their



venerable gags, stale jokes, and nauseating slanders, I had no



desire to hear them, and did not care to sit on the platform



with them; but that when they had a speaker to whom I



cared to listen I would gladly come.  The result was that



one day I received a letter inviting me to preside over a



mass-meeting at Syracuse, at which Mr. McKinley was to



make the speech.  I accepted gladly and on the appointed



evening arrived at the Syracuse railway station.  There



I found the mayor of the city ready to take me in his



carriage to the hall where the meeting was to be held; but we



had hardly left the station when he said to me:  ``Mr.



White, I am very sorry, but Mr. McKinley has been de-



layed and we have had to get another speaker.''  I was



greatly disappointed, and expressed my feelings somewhat



energetically, when the mayor said:  ``But this speaker is



really splendid; he carries all before him; he is a thorough



Kentucky orator.''  My answer was that I knew the breed



but too well, and that if I had known that Mr. McKinley



was not to come I certainly would not have left my work



at the university.  By this time we had arrived at the door



of the Globe Hotel, whence the speaker entered the carriage. 



He was a tall, sturdy Kentuckian, and his appearance



and manner showed that he had passed a very convivial



day with the younger members of the committee



appointed to receive him.







His first words on entering the carriage were not very



reassuring.  No sooner had I been introduced to him than



he asked where he could get a glass of brandy.  ``For,''



said he, ``without a good drink just before I go on the



platform I can't make a speech.''  I attempted to quiet



him and to show him the difficulties in the case.  I said: 



``Colonel ----, you have been with our young men here



all day, and no doubt have had a fairly good time; but in



our meetings here there is just now need of especial care. 



You will have in your audience to-night a large number of



the more sedate and conservative citizens of Syracuse,



church members, men active in the various temperance



societies, and the like.  There never was a campaign when



men were in greater doubt; great numbers of these people



have not yet made up their minds how they will vote, and



the slightest exhilaration on your part may cost us



hundreds of votes.''  He answered:  ``That's all very well, but



the simple fact is that I am here to make a speech, and I



can't make it unless I have a good drink beforehand.''  I



said nothing more, but, as he still pressed the subject on the



mayor and the other member of the committee, I quietly



said to them as I left the carriage:  ``If that man drinks



anything more before speaking, I will not go on the stage



with him, and the reason why I don't will speedily be



made known.''  The mayor reassured me, and we all went



together into the large room adjoining the stage, I keeping



close watch over the orator, taking pains to hold him



steadily in conversation, introducing as many leading



men of the town to him as possible, thus preventing any



opportunity to carry out his purpose of taking more



strong drink, and to my great satisfaction he had no



opportunity to do so before we were summoned into the hall.







Arrived there, I made my speech, and then the orator of



the evening arose.  But just before he began to speak



he filled from a water-pitcher a large glass, and drank



it off.  My thought at the moment was that this would



dilute some of the stronger fluids he had absorbed during



the day and cool him down somewhat.  He then



went on in a perfectly self-possessed way, betrayed not the



slightest effect of drinking, and made a most convincing



and effective speech, replete with wit and humor; yet,



embedded in his wit and humor and rollicking fun, were



arguments appealing to the best sentiments of his hearers.  The



speech was in every way a success; at its close I congratulated



him upon it, and was about to remind him that he



had done very well on his glass of cold water, when he



suddenly said to me:  ``Mr. White, you see that it was just



as I told you: if I had n't taken that big glass of gin from



the pitcher just before I started, I could not have made



any speech.''







``All 's well that ends well,'' and, though the laugh was



at my expense, the result was not such as to make me



especially unhappy.







But this campaign of 1884 ended as I had expected.  Mr.



Cleveland was elected to the Presidency.















CHAPTER XIII







HENDRICKS, JOHN SHERMAN, BANCROFT,



AND OTHERS--1884-1891







The following spring, visiting Washington, I met



President Cleveland again.







Of the favorable impression made upon me by his



career as Governor of New York I have already spoken,



and shall have occasion to speak presently of his



Presidency.  The renewal of our acquaintance even increased



my respect for him.  He was evidently a strong, honest



man, trying to do his duty under difficulties.







I also met again Mr. Cleveland's opponent in the previous



campaign--Mr. Blaine.  Calling on Mr. William



Walter Phelps, then in Congress, whom I had known as



minister of the United States at Vienna, and who was



afterward my successor at Berlin, I made some reference



to Mr. Blaine, when Mr. Phelps said:  ``Why don't



you go and call upon him?''  I answered that it might



be embarrassing to both of us, to which he replied:  ``I



don't think so.  In spite of your opposition to him



at Chicago, were I in your place I would certainly go



to his house and call upon him.''  That afternoon I



took this advice, and when I returned to the hotel Mr.



Blaine came with me, talking in a most interesting way. 



He spoke of my proposed journey to Virginia, and discussed



Jefferson and Hamilton, admiring both, but Jefferson



the most.  As to his own working habits, he said



that he rose early, did his main work in the morning, and



never did any work in the evening; that, having been



brought up in strongly Sabbatarian notions during his



boyhood in Pennsylvania, he had ever since, from the



force of habit, reserved Sunday as a day of complete rest. 



Speaking of the customs in Pennsylvania at that time, he



said that not even a walk for exercise was allowed, and



nothing was ever cooked on the sacred day.







I met him afterward on various occasions, and could not



but admire him.  At a dinner-party he was vexatiously



badgered by a very bumptious professor, who allowed



himself to speak in a rather offensive manner of ideas



which Mr. Blaine represented; and the quiet but decisive



way in which the latter disposed of his pestering



interlocutor was worthy of all praise.







Mr. Blaine was certainly the most fascinating man I



have ever known in politics.  No wonder that so many



Republicans in all parts of the country seemed ready to



give their lives to elect him.  The only other public man



in the United States whose personality had ever elicited



such sympathy and devotion was Henry Clay.  Perhaps



his nearest friend was Mr. Phelps, to whom I have



referred above,--one of the best, truest, and most winning



men I have ever known.  He had been especially



devoted to Mr. Blaine, with whom he had served in



Congress, and it was understood that if the latter had been



elected Mr. Phelps would have been his Secretary of State.







Mr. Phelps complained to me, half seriously, half



jocosely, of what is really a crying abuse in the United States



--namely, that there is no proper reporting of the



proceedings of the Houses of Congress in the main journals



of the country which can enable the people at large



to form any just idea as to how their representatives are



conducting the public business.  He said:  ``I may make



a most careful speech on any important subject before



Congress and it will not be mentioned in the New York



papers, but let me make a joke and it will be published all



over the United States.  Yesterday, on a wager, I tried



an experiment:  I made two poor little jokes during a short



talk in the House, and here they are in the New York



papers of this morning.''







During this visit to Washington I met at the house of



my classmate and dear friend, Randall Gibson, then a



senator from Louisiana, a number of distinguished men



among them the Vice-President, Mr. Hendricks, and General



Butler, senator from South Carolina.







Vice-President Hendricks seemed sick and sore.  He



had expected to be a candidate for the Presidency, with



a strong probability of election, but had accepted the Vice-



Presidency; and the subject which seemed to elicit his



most vitriolic ill will was reform in the civil service.  As we



sat one evening in the smoking-room at Senator Gibson's



he was very bitter against the system, when, to my surprise,



General Butler took up the cudgels against him and



made a most admirable argument.  At that moment, for



the first time, I felt that the war between North and South



was over; for all the old issues seemed virtually settled,



and here, as regarded this new issue, on which I felt very



deeply, was one of the most ardent of Confederate soldiers,



a most bitter pro-slavery man before the Civil War,



one who, during the war, had lost a leg in battle, nearer



me politically than were many of my friends and neighbors



in the North.







Senator Jones of Florida, who was present, gave us



some character sketches, and among others delineated



admirably General Williams, known in the Mexican War



as ``Cerro Gordo Williams,'' who was for a time senator



from Kentucky.  He said that Williams had a wonderful



gift of spread-eagle oratory, but that, finding no



listeners for it among his colleagues, he became utterly



disgusted and went about saying that the Senate was a



``d----d frigid, respectable body that chilled his intellect.'' 



This led my fellow-guests to discuss the characteristics of



the Senate somewhat, and I was struck by one remark in



which all agreed--namely, that ``there are no politics in



executive session.''







Gibson remarked that the best speech he had ever



heard in the Senate was made by John Sherman.







As regards civil-service matters, I found on all sides



an opinion that Mr. Cleveland was, just as far as possible,



basing his appointments upon merit.  Gibson mentioned



the fact that a candidate for an important office in his



State, who had committed three murders, had secured



very strong backing, but that President Cleveland utterly



refused to appoint him.







With President Cleveland I had a very interesting



interview.  He referred to his visit to Cornell University,



said that he would have liked nothing so well as to go



more thoroughly through its various departments, and, as



when I formerly saw him, expressed his regret at the loss



of such opportunities as an institution of that kind affords.







At this time I learned from him and from those near



him something regarding his power for hard work.  It



was generally understood that he insisted on writing out



all important papers and conducting his correspondence



in his own hand, and the result was that during a



considerable period of the congressional sessions he sat at



his desk until three o'clock in the morning.







It was evident that his up-and-down, curt, independent



way did not at all please some of the leading members



of his party; in fact, there were signs of a serious



estrangement caused by the President's refusals to yield



to senators and other leaders of the party in the matter



of appointments to office.  To illustrate this feeling, a



plain, bluff Western senator, Mr. Sawyer of Wisconsin,



told me a story.







Senator Sawyer had built up a fortune and gained a



great influence in his State by a very large and extensive



business in pine lumber, and he had a sort of rough,



quaint woodman's wit which was at times very amusing. 



He told me that, some days before, two of his most eminent



Democratic colleagues in the Senate were just leaving the



Capitol, and from something they said he saw that they



were going to call upon the President.  He therefore



asked them, ``How do you like this new President of



yours?''  ``Oh,'' answered the senators in chorus, ``he is



a very good man--a very good man indeed.''  ``Yes,''



said Senator Sawyer, ``but how do you LIKE him?''  ``Oh,''



answered the senators, ``we like him very much--very



much indeed.''  ``Well,'' said Sawyer, ``I will tell you a



story before you go to the White House if you will agree



when you get back, to tell me--`honest Injun'--whether it



suits your case.''  Both laughingly agreed, and Mr. Sawyer



then told them the following story:  When he was a



young man with very small means, he and two or three



other young wood-choppers made up an expedition for



lumber-cutting.  As they were too poor to employ a cook



for their camp, they agreed to draw lots, and that the



one on whom the lot fell should be cook, but only until



some one of the company found fault; then the fault-



finder should become cook in his turn.  Lots being



drawn, one of them, much to his disgust, was thus chosen



cook, and toward the close of the day he returned to camp,



before the others, to get supper ready.  Having taken



from the camp stores a large quantity of beans, he put



them into a pot boiling over the fire, as he had seen his



mother do in his boyhood, and then proceeded to pour in



salt.  Unfortunately the salt-box slipped in his hand, and



he poured in much more than he had intended--in fact, the



whole contents of the box.  On the return of the woodmen



to the cabin, ravenously hungry, they proceeded to dish



out the boiled beans, but the first one who put a spoonful



in his mouth instantly cried out with a loud objurgation,



``Thunder and lightning! this dish is all salt''; but, in a



moment, remembering that if he found fault he must himself



become cook, he said very gently, ``BUT I LIKE SALT.''



Both senators laughed and agreed that they would give



an honest report of their feelings to Senator Sawyer



when they had seen the President.  On their return, Sawyer



met them and said, ``Well, honest Injun, how was it?'' 



They both laughed and said, ``Well, we like salt.''







Among many interesting experiences I recall especially



a dinner at the house of Mr. Fairchild, Secretary



of the Treasury.  He spoke of the civil service, and said



that a short time previously President Cleveland had



said to him, regarding the crowd pressing for office:  ``A



suggestion to these office-seekers as to the good of the



country would make them faint.''







During this dinner I happened to be seated between



Senators John Sherman of Ohio and Vance of Georgia,



and presently Mr. Vance--one of the jolliest mortals I



have ever met--turned toward his colleague, Senator Sherman,



and said, very blandly:  ``Senator, I am glad to see



you back from Ohio; I hope you found your fences in



good condition.''  There was a general laugh, and when



it was finished Senator Sherman told me in a pleasant



way how the well-known joke about his ``looking after his



fences'' arose.  He said that he was the owner of a large



farm in Ohio, and that some years previously his tenant



wrote urging him most earnestly to improve its fences,



so that finally he went to Ohio to look into the matter. 



On arriving there, he found a great crowd awaiting



him and calling for a speech, when he excused himself



by saying that he had not come to Ohio on political



business, but had merely come ``to look after his fences.'' 



The phrase caught the popular fancy, and ``to look after



one's fences'' became synonymous with minding one's



political safeguards.







I remember also an interesting talk with Mr. Bayard,



who had been one of the most eminent senators in his time,



who was then Secretary of State, and who became, at a



later period, ambassador of the United States to Great



Britain.  Speaking of office-seeking, he gave a comical



account of the developing claims of sundry applicants



for foreign missions, who, he said, ``are at first willing to



go, next anxious to go, and finally angry because they



cannot go.''







On another social occasion, the possibility of another



attempt at secession by States being discussed, General



Butler of South Carolina said:  ``No more secession for



me.''  To this, Senator Gibson, who also had been a brigadier-



general in the Confederate service, and had seen



much hard fighting, said, ``And no more for me.'' Butler



rejoined, ``We may have to help in preventing others from



seceding one of these days.''  I was glad to note that both



Butler and Gibson spoke thoroughly well of their former



arch-enemy, General Grant.







Very interesting was it to meet again Mr. George



Bancroft.  He referred to his long service as minister at



Berlin, expressed his surprise that Bismarck, whom he



remembered as fat, had become bony, and was very severe



against both clericals and liberals who had voted against



allowing aid to Bismarck in the time of his country's



greatest necessity.







I also met my Cornell colleague Goldwin Smith, the



former Oxford professor and historian, who expressed his



surprise and delight at the perfect order and decorum of



the crowd, numbering nearly five thousand persons, at the



presidential levee the night before.  In order to understand



what an American crowd was like, instead of going



into the White House by the easier way, as he was entitled



by his invitation to do, he had taken his place in the long



procession far outside the gate and gradually moved



through the grounds into the presidential presence, taking



about an hour for the purpose.  He said that there was



never any pressing, crowding, or impatience, and he



compared the crowd most favorably with any similar body in



a London street.







Chief Justice Waite I also found a very substantial



interesting man; but especially fascinating was General



Sheridan, who, at a dinner given by my Berlin predecessor,



Mr. Bancroft Davis, described the scene at the battle



of Gravelotte when, owing to a rush by the French, the



Emperor of Germany was for a time in real danger and



was reluctantly obliged to fall back.  He said that during



the panic and retreat toward Thionville he saw the Emperor



halt from time to time to scold soldiers who threw



away their muskets; that very many German soldiers,



during this panic, cast aside everything except the clothes



they wore--not only their guns, but their helmets; that



afterward the highways and fields were strewn thickly



with these, and that wagons were sent out to collect them. 



He also said that Bismarck spoke highly to him regarding



the martial and civil qualities of the crown prince,



afterward the Emperor Frederick, but that regarding



the Red Prince, Frederick Charles, he expressed a very



different opinion.







Speaking of a statement that some one had invented



armor which would ward off a rifle-ball, Sheridan said



that during the Civil War an officer who wore a steel vest



beneath his coat was driven out of decent society by



general contempt; and at this Goldwin Smith told a story of



the Duke of Wellington, who, when troubled by an inventor



of armor, nearly scared him to death by ordering



him to wear his own armor and allow a platoon of soldiers



to fire at him.







During the course of the conversation Sheridan said



that soldiers were braver now than ever before--braver,



indeed, than the crusaders, as was proved by the fact



that in these days they wear no armor.  To this Goldwin



Smith answered that he thought war in the middle ages



was more destructive than even in our time.  Sheridan



said that breech-loading rifles kill more than all the



cannon.







At a breakfast given by Goldwin Smith at Wormley's,



Bancroft, speaking of Berlin matters, said that the Emperor



William did not know that Germany was the second



power in the world so far as a mercantile navy was



concerned until he himself told him; and on the ignorance



of monarchs regarding their own domains, Goldwin



Smith said that Lord Malmesbury, when assured by Napoleon



III that in the plebiscite he would have the vote of



the army, which was five hundred thousand, answered,



``But, your majesty, your army numbers seven hundred



thousand,'' whereupon the Emperor was silent.  The in-



ference was that his majesty knew a large part of his



army to be merely on paper.







At this Mr. John Field, of Philadelphia, said that on



the breaking out of the Franco-Prussian War he went to



General Grant at Long Branch, and asked him how the



war was likely to turn out, to which the general answered,



``As I am President of the United States, I am unable to



answer.''  ``But,'' said Field, ``I am a citizen sovereign



and ask an opinion.''  ``Well,'' said General Grant,



``confidentially, the Germans will beat the French thoroughly



and march on Paris.  The French army is a mere shell.'' 



This reminded me that General Grant, on my own visit



to him some weeks before, had foretold to me sundry



difficulties of Lord Wolseley in Egypt just as they afterward



occurred.







At a dinner with Senator Morrill of Vermont I met



General Schenck, formerly a leading member of Congress



and minister to Brazil and to England.  He was very



interesting in his sketches of English orators; thought



Bright the best, Gladstone admirable, and Sir Stafford



Northcote, with his everlasting hawing and humming,



intolerable.  He gave interesting reminiscences of Tom



Corwin, his old preceptor, and said that Corwin's power



over an audience was magical.  He added that he once



attended a public dinner in Boston, and, sitting near



Everett, who was the chief speaker, noticed that when the



waiters sought to clear the table and were about to remove



a bouquet containing two small flags, Everett would not



allow them to do it, and that later in the evening, during



his speech, just at the proper point, he caught up these



flags, as if accidentally, and waved them.  He said that



everything with Everett and Choate seemed to be cut and



dried; that even the interruptions seemed prepared beforehand.







Senator Morrill then told a story regarding Everett's



great speech at the opening of the Dudley Observatory



at Albany, which I had heard at the time of its delivery. 



In this speech Everett said:  ``Last night, crossing the



Connecticut River, I saw mirrored in its waters Arcturus,



then fully at the zenith, and I thought,'' etc., etc.; ``but,''



said Morrill, ``some one looked into the matter and found



that Everett, before leaving home, had evidently turned



the globe in his study wrong side up, for at that time



Arcturus was not at the zenith, but at the nadir.''







At the Cornell commencement of this year (1885) I



resigned my presidency of the university.  It had



nominally lasted eighteen years, but really more than twenty,



since I had taken the lead in the work of the university



even before its charter was granted, twenty years previously,



and from that day the main charge of its organization



and of everything except providing funds had been



intrusted to me.  Regarding this part of my life I shall



speak more fully in another chapter.







Shortly after this resignation two opportunities were



offered me which caused me considerable thought.







As to the first, President Cleveland was kind enough



to write me an autograph letter asking whether I would



accept one of the positions on the new Interstate Railway



Commission.  I felt it a great honor to be asked to act as



colleague with such men as Chief Justice Cooley, Mr.



Morrison, and others already upon that board, but I



recognized my own incompetence to discharge the duties of



such a position properly.  Though I had been, some years



before, a director in two of the largest railway corporations



in the United States, my heart was never in that



duty, and I never prepared myself to discharge it. 



Thinking the matter over fully, I felt obliged to decline



the place.  My heart was set on finishing the book which



I had so long wished to publish,--my ``History of the



Warfare of Science with Theology,''--and in order to



cut myself off from other work and get some needed



rest I sailed for Europe on October 3, 1885, but while



engaged most delightfully in visits to Oxford,



Cambridge, and various places on the Continent, I received



by cable an offer which had also a very tempting side. 



It was sent by my old friend Mr. Henry Sage of Ithaca,



urged me to accept the nomination to Congress from that



district, and assured me that the nomination was equivalent



to an election.  There were some reasons why such a



position was attractive to me, but the more I thought of



it the more it seemed to me that to discharge these duties



properly would take me from other work to which I was



pledged.  Before deciding the question, however, I determined



to consult two old friends who were then living in



London hotels adjacent to my own.  The first of these was



my dear old instructor, with whom my relations had been



of the kindest ever since my first year at Yale--President



Porter.







On my laying the matter before him, he said, ``Accept



by all means''; but as I showed him the reasons on both



sides, he at last reluctantly agreed with me that probably



it was best to send a declination.







The other person consulted was Mr. James Belden of



Syracuse, afterward a member of Congress from the



Onondaga district, a politician who had a most intimate



knowledge of men and affairs in our State.  We had been



during a long period, political adversaries, but I had



come to respect sundry qualities he had more lately



exhibited, and therefore went to him as a practical man



and laid the case before him.  He expressed his great



surprise that I should advise with him, my old political



adversary, but he said, ``Since you do come, I will give



you the very best advice I can.''







We then went over the case together, and I feel sure



that he advised me as well as the oldest of my friends



could have done, and with a shrewdness and foresight



all his own.







One of his arguments ran somewhat as follows:  ``To



be successful in politics a man must really think of



nothing else; it must be his first thought in the morning and



his last at night; everything else must yield to it.  Heretofore



you have quietly gone on your way, sought nothing,



and taken what has been freely tendered you in the interest



of the party and of the public.  I know the Elmira



district, and you can have the nomination and the election



without trouble; but the question is whether you could



ever be happy in the sort of work which you must do in



order to take a proper place in the House of Representatives. 



First of all, you must give up everything else and



devote yourself to that alone; and even then, when you



have succeeded, you have only to look about you and see



the men who have achieved success in that way, and who,



after all, have found in it nothing but disappointment.'' 



In saying this he expressed the conclusion at which I had



already arrived.







I cabled my absolute declination of the nomination, and



was reproved by my friends for not availing myself of



this opportunity to take part in political affairs, but have



nevertheless always felt that my decision was wise.







To tell the truth, I never had, and never desired to



have, any capacity for the rough-and-tumble of politics. 



I greatly respect many of the men who have gifts of



that sort, but have recognized the fact that my influence



in and on politics must be of a different kind.  I have



indeed taken part in some stormy scenes in conventions,



meetings, and legislatures, but always with regret.  My



true r<o^>le has been a more quiet one.  My ambition,



whether I have succeeded in it or not, has been to set



young men in trains of fruitful thought, to bring mature



men into the line of right reason, and to aid in devising



and urging needed reforms, in developing and supporting



wise policies, and in building up institutions which shall



strengthen what is best in American life.







Early in 1891 I was asked by Mr. Sherman Rogers



of Buffalo, one of the best and truest men in political



life that I have ever known, to accompany him and



certain other gentlemen to Washington, in order to



present to Mr. Harrison, who had now become President of



the United States, an argument for the extension of the



civil-service rules.  Accompanied by Mr. Theodore



Roosevelt and Senator Cabot Lodge, our delegation reached



the Executive Mansion at the time fixed by the President,



and were received in a way which surprised me.  Mr.



Harrison seemed, to say the least, not in good humor.  He



stood leaning on the corner of his desk, and he asked none



of us to sit.  All of us had voted for him, and had come



to him in his own interest as well as in the interest of the



country; but he seemed to like us none the better for all



that.  The first speech was made by Mr. Rogers.  Dwelling



on the disappointment of thoughtful Republicans



throughout the country at the delay in redeeming pledges



made by the Republican National Convention as to the



extension of the civil service, and reiterated in the



President's own speeches in the United States Senate, he in a



playful way referred to the conduct of certain officials in



Buffalo, when the President interrupted him, as it seemed



to me at the time very brusquely and even rudely



saying:  ``Mr. Rogers, you have no right to impute evil



motives to any man.  The motives of these gentlemen to



whom you refer are presumably as good as your own.  An



argument based upon such imputations cannot advance the



cause you support in the slightest degree.''  Mr. Rogers



was somewhat disconcerted for a moment, but, having



resumed his speech, he presented, in a very dignified and



convincing way, the remainder of his argument.  He was



followed by the other members from various States, giving



different sides of the case, each showing the importance



which Republicans in his own part of the country



attributed to an extension of the civil-service rules.







My own turn came last.  I said:  ``Mr. President:  I will



make no speech, but will simply state two facts.







``First: Down to a comparatively recent period every



high school, college, and university in the Northern States



has been a center of Republican ideas: no one will gainsay



this for a moment.  But recently there has come a change. 



During nearly twenty years it has been my duty to nominate



to the trustees of Cornell University candidates for



various positions in its faculty; the fundamental charter



of the institution absolutely forbids any consideration, in



such cases, of the party or sect to which any candidate



belongs, and I have always faithfully carried out that



injunction, never, in any one of the multitude of nominations



that I have made, allowing the question of politics to



enter in the slightest degree.  But still it has happened that,



almost without exception, the candidates have proved to be



Republicans, and this to such an extent that at times I have



regretted it; for the university has been obliged frequently



to ask for legislation from a Democratic legislature,



and I have always feared that this large preponderance



of Republican professors would be brought up



against us as an evidence that we were not true to the



principles of our charter.  As a matter of fact, down to



two or three years since, there were, as I casually learned,



out of a faculty of about fifty members, not over eight



or ten Democrats.  But during these recent years all this



has been changed, and at the State election, when Judge



Folger was defeated for the governorship, I found to my



surprise that, almost without exception, my colleagues in



the faculty had voted the Democratic ticket; so far as I



could learn, but three besides myself had voted for the



Republican candidate.''  President Harrison immediately



said:  ``Mr. White, was that not chiefly due to the free-



trade tendencies of college-men?''  I answered:  ``No, Mr.



President; the great majority of these men who voted



with the Democrats were protectionists, and you will



yourself see that they must have been so if they had



continued to vote for the Republican ticket down to that



election.  All that I hear leads me to the conviction



that the real cause is disappointment at the delay of the



Republican party in making good its promises to improve



the public service.  In this question the faculties of our



colleges and universities, especially in the Eastern, Middle,



and Northern States, take a deep interest.  In fact, it



is with them the question of all questions; and I think



this is one of the things which, at that election in New



York, caused the most overwhelming defeat that a candidate



for governor had ever experienced.''  To this the



President listened attentively, and I then said:  ``Mr.



President, my second point is this:  The State of New



York is, of course, of immense importance to the Republican



party, and it has been carried in recent years by a



majority of a few hundred votes.  There are more than



fourteen thousand school districts in the State, and in



nearly every one of these school districts there are a



certain number of earnest men--anywhere from a handful



to a houseful--who believe that since the slavery question



is removed from national politics, the only burning



question which remains is the `spoils system' and the



reform of the civil service.  Now, you have only to multiply



the fourteen thousand school districts by a very



small figure, and you will see the importance of this question



as regards the vote of the State of New York.  I know



whereof I speak, for I have myself addressed meetings



in many of these districts in favor of a reform of the civil



service, have had correspondence with other districts in



all parts of the State, and am sure that there is a deep-



seated feeling on the subject in great numbers of them,--



a feeling akin to what used to be called in the anti-slavery



days `fanaticism,'--that is, a deep-seated conviction that



this is now the most important question before the American



people, and that it must be settled in precedence



to all others.''







The President received what I had to say courteously,



and then began a reply to us all.  He took at first rather



a bitter tone, saying that he had a right to find fault



with all of us; that the Civil Service League had



denounced his administration most unjustly for its relation



to the spoils system; that he was moving as rapidly in the



matter as circumstances permitted; that he was anxious



to redeem the promises made by the party and by himself;



that he had already done something and purposed to do



more; and that the glorifications of the progress made by



the previous administration in this respect, at the expense



of his own, had been grossly unjust.







To this we made a short rejoinder on one point, stating



that his complaint against us was without foundation;



that not one of us was a member of the Civil Service



League; that not one of us had taken any part in its



deliberations; and that we could not, therefore, be made



responsible in any way for its utterances.  The President



now became somewhat more genial, though he did not



ask us to be seated, alluding in a pungent but good-natured



way to the zeal for reform shown by Mr. Roosevelt,



who was standing by, and closing in considerably better



humor than he had begun.  Although I cannot say that I



was greatly pleased with his treatment of the committee,



I remembered that, although courtesy was not generally



considered his strong point, he was known to possess



many sterling qualities, and I felt bound to allow that his



speech revealed a man of strength and honest purpose. 



All of us, even Mr. Roosevelt and Senator Lodge, came



away believing that good had been done, and that the



President, before his term of office had expired, would do



what he could in the right direction; and I am glad to say



that this expectation was fulfilled.















CHAPTER XIV







McKINLEY AND ROOSEVELT--1891-1904







During the summer of 1891 came a curious episode in



my life, to which, as it was considerably discussed in



the newspapers at the time, and as various sensational



news-makers have dwelt upon it since, I may be permitted



to refer.  During several years before,--in fact, ever since



my two terms in the State Senate,--various people, and



especially my old Cornell students throughout the State,



had written to me and published articles in my behalf



as a candidate for governor.  I had never encouraged



these, and whenever I referred to them deprecated



them, since I preferred a very different line of life,



and felt that the grapple with spoilsmen which every



governor must make would wear me out very rapidly. 



But the election which was that year approaching was felt



to be very important, and old friends from various



parts of the State thought that, in the severe contest



which was expected, I stood a better chance of election



than any other who could be named at that particular



time, their theory being that the German vote of the State



would come to me, and that it would probably come to no



other Republican.







The reason for this theory was that I had received part



of my education in Germany; had shown especial interest



in German history and literature, lecturing upon them at



the University of Michigan and at Cornell; had resided in



Berlin as minister; had, on my return, delivered in New



York and elsewhere an address on the ``New Germany,''



wherein were shown some points in German life which



Americans might study to advantage; had also delivered



an address on the ``Contributions of Germany to American



Civilization''; and had, at various times, formed pleasant



relations with leading Germans of both parties.  The fact



was perfectly well known, also, that I was opposed to the



sumptuary laws which had so largely driven Germans out



of the Republican party, and had declared that these were



not only unjust to those immediately affected by them, but



injurious to the very interests of temperance, which they



were designed to promote.







I was passing the summer at Magnolia, on the east



coast of Massachusetts, when an old friend, the son of



an eminent German-American, came from New York and



asked me to become a candidate for the governorship. 



I was very reluctant, for special as well as general



reasons.  My first wish was to devote myself wholly to



certain long-deferred historical work; my health was not



strong; I felt utterly unfitted for the duties of the



campaign, and the position of governor, highly honorable as



it is, presented no especial attractions to me, my ambition



not being in that line.  Therefore it was that at first I



urged my friends to combine upon some other person;



but as they came back and insisted that they could



agree on no one else, and that I could bring to the





support of the party men who would otherwise oppose it,



I reluctantly agreed to discuss the subject with some of



the leading Republicans in New York, and among them



Mr. Thomas C. Platt, who was at the head of the organized



management of the party.







In our two or three conversations Mr. Platt impressed



me curiously.  I had known him slightly for many years;



indeed, we had belonged to the same class at Yale, but as



he had left it and I had entered it at the beginning of the



sophomore year we did not know each other at that period. 



We had met occasionally when we were both supporting



Mr. Conkling, but had broken from each other at the time



when he was supporting Mr. Blaine, and I, Mr. Edmunds,



for the nomination at Chicago.  Our discussion now took



a form which somewhat surprised me.  The general belief



throughout the State was, I think, that Mr. Platt's



first question, or, at any rate, his main question, in any such



discussion, would be, necessarily, as to the attitude of the



candidate toward Mr. Platt's own interests and aspirations. 



But I feel bound to say that in the discussions between



us no such questions were ever asked, approached,



or even hinted at.  Mr. Platt never asked me a question



regarding my attitude toward him or toward his friends;



he never even hinted at my making any pledge or promise



to do anything or not to do anything with reference to



his own interests or to those of any other person; his



whole effort was directed to finding what strength my



nomination would attract to the party and what it would



repel.  He had been informed regarding one or two



unpopular votes of mine when I was in the State Senate--as



for example, that I had opposed the efforts of a powerful



sectarian organization to secure the gift of certain



valuable landed property from the city of New York; he had



also been informed regarding certain review and magazine



articles in which I had spoken my mind somewhat



freely against certain influences in the State which were



still powerful, and it had been hinted to him that my



``Warfare of Science'' chapters might have alienated a



considerable number of the more narrow-minded clergymen



and their flocks.







I told Mr. Platt frankly that these fears seemed quite



likely to be well founded, and that there were some other



difficulties which I could myself suggest to him: that I had



in the course of my life, made many opponents in supporting



Cornell University, and in expressing my mind



on various questions, political and religious, and that



these seemed to me likely to cost the party very many



votes.  I therefore suggested that he consult certain



persons in various parts of the State who were entitled to



have an opinion, and especially two men of the highest



judgment in such matters--Chief Justice Andrews of



Syracuse, and Carroll Earl Smith, editor of the leading



Republican journal in central New York.  The result was



that telegrams and letters were exchanged, these gentlemen



declaring their decided opinion that the matters referred



to were bygones, and could not be resuscitated in



the coming contest; that they would be lost sight of in the



real questions sure to arise; and that even in the election



immediately following the vote which I had cast against



giving a large tract of Ward's Island to a Roman Catholic



institution, I had lost no votes, but had held my own with



the other candidates, and even gained upon some of them.







Mr. Platt also discussed my relations to the Germans



and to the graduates of Cornell University who were scattered



all over the State; and as these, without exception,



so far as could be learned, were my warm personal



friends, it was felt by those who had presented my name,



and finally, I think, by Mr. Platt, that these two elements



in my support might prove valuable.







Still, in spite of this, I advised steadily against my own



nomination, and asked Mr. Platt:  ``Why don't you support



your friend Senator Fassett of Elmira?  He is a



young man; he has very decided abilities; he is popular;



his course in the legislature has been admirable; you have



made him collector of the port of New York, and he is



known to be worthy of the place.  Why don't you ask



him?''  Mr. Platt's frankness in reply increased my



respect for him.  He said:  ``I need not confess to you that,



personally, I would prefer Mr. Fassett to yourself; but if



he were a candidate he would have to carry the entire



weight of my unpopularity.''







Mr. Platt was from first to last perfectly straightforward. 



He owed me nothing, for I had steadily voted



against him and his candidate in the National Convention



at Chicago.  He had made no pledges to me, for I had



allowed him to make none--even if he had been disposed



to do so; moreover, many of my ideas were opposed to his



own.  I think the heaviest piece of work I ever undertook



was when, some months before, I had endeavored to convert 



him to the civil-service-reform forces; but while I had



succeeded in converting a good many others, he remained



intractable, and on that subject we were at opposite poles. 







It therefore seems to me altogether to his credit that,



in spite of this personal and theoretical antagonism



between us, and in spite of the fact that I had made, and he



knew that I would make, no pledges or promises whatever



to him in view of an election, he had favored my



nomination solely as the best chance of obtaining a



Republican victory in the State; and I will again say that I



do not believe that his own personal advantage entered



into his thoughts on this occasion.  His pride and his



really sincere devotion to the interests of the Republican



party, as he understood them, led him to desire, above all



things, a triumph over the Democratic forces, and the



only question in his mind was, Who could best secure the



victory?







At the close of these conferences he was evidently in my



favor, but on leaving the city I said to him:  ``Do not



consider yourself as in any way pledged to my support.  Go



to the convention at Rochester, and decide what is best



after you get there.  I have no desire for the nomination--



in fact, would prefer that some one else bear the burden



and heat of the day.  I have been long out of touch with



the party managers in the State.  I don't feel that they



would support me as they would support some man like



Mr. Fassett, whom they know and like personally, and I



shall not consider you as pledged to me in the slightest



degree.  I don't ask it; I don't wish it; in fact, I prefer



the contrary.  Go to Rochester, be guided by circumstances,



and decide as you see fit.''







In the meantime various things seemed to strengthen



my candidacy.  Leading Germans who had been for some



time voting with the Democratic party pledged themselves



to my support if I were nominated, and one of them could



bring over to my side one of the most powerful Democratic



journals in the State; in fact, there were pledged



to my support two leading journals which, as matters



turned out afterward, opposed the Republican nomination.







At the convention which met shortly afterward at



Rochester (September, 1891), things went as I had



anticipated, and indeed as I had preferred.  Mr. Platt found



the elements supporting Mr. Fassett even stronger than



he had expected.  The undercurrent was too powerful for



him, and he was obliged to yield to it.







Of course sundry newspapers screamed that he had



deceived and defeated me.  I again do him the justice to say



that this was utterly untrue.  I am convinced that he went



to Rochester believing my candidacy best for the party;



that he really did what he could in my favor, but that he



found, what I had foretold, that Mr. Fassett, young,



energetic, known, and liked by the active political men in



various parts of the State, naturally wished to lead the



forces and was naturally the choice of the convention--a



choice which it was not within Mr. Platt's power to change.







Mr. Fassett was nominated, and I do not know that I



have ever received a message which gave me a greater



sense of relief than the telegram which announced this fact



to me.







As regards the inside history of the convention, Professor



Jenks of Cornell University, a very thoughtful



student of practical politics, who had gone to Rochester



to see the working of a New York State convention, told



me some time afterward that he had circulated very freely



among the delegates from various rural districts; that they



had no acquaintance with him, and therefore talked freely



in his presence regarding the best policy of the convention. 



As a rule, the prevailing feeling among them was



expressed as follows:  ``White don't know the boys; he



don't know the men who do the work of the party; he



supports civil-service reform, and that means that after



doing the work of the campaign we shall have no better



chance for the offices than men who have done nothing--in



fact, not so good, perhaps, as those who have opposed



us.''  No doubt this feeling entered into the minds of a



large number of delegates and conduced to the result.







A few weeks afterward Mr. Fassett came to Ithaca.  I



had the pleasure of presiding and speaking at the public



meeting which he addressed, and of entertaining him at



my house.  He was in every way worthy of the position



to which he had been nominated, but, unfortunately, was



not elected.







Having made one or two speeches in this campaign, I



turned to more congenial work, and in the early spring



of the following year (February 12 to May 16, 1892)



accepted an election as non-resident professor at Stanford



University in California, my duty being to deliver a



course of twenty lectures upon ``The Causes of the French



Revolution.''  Just as I was about to start, Mr. Andrew



Carnegie very kindly invited me to go as his guest in his



own car and with a delightful party.  There were eight of



us--four ladies and four gentlemen.  We went by way of



Washington, Chattanooga, and New Orleans, stopping at



each place, and meeting many leading men; then to the



city of Mexico, where we were presented to Porfirio Diaz,



the president of that republic, who seemed to be a man of



great shrewdness and strength.  I recall here the fact that



the room in which he received us was hung round with



satin coverings, on which, as the only ornament, were the



crown and cipher of Diaz' unfortunate predecessor, the



Emperor Maximilian.  Thence we went to California, and



zigzag along the Pacific coast to Tacoma and Seattle;



then through the Rocky Mountains to Salt Lake City



meeting everywhere interesting men and things, until at



Denver I left the party and went back to give my lectures



at Stanford.







Returning to Cornell University in the early summer



I found myself in the midst of my books and happy in



resuming my work.  But now, July 21, 1892, came my



nomination by President Harrison to the position of envoy



extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary at St.



Petersburg.  On thinking the matter over, it seemed to me



that it would be instructive and agreeable to have a second



diplomatic experience in Russia after my absence of



nearly forty years.  I therefore accepted, and in the autumn



of 1892 left America for St. Petersburg.







While in Washington to receive my instructions before



leaving, I again met Mr. Harrison, and must say that he



showed a much more kindly and genial side than that



which had formerly been revealed to me, when I had



discussed shortcomings of his administration as regarded



the civil service.







My occupancy of this new position lasted until the



autumn of 1894, and there was one thing in it which I have



always regarded as a great honor.  Mr. Harrison had



appointed me at about the close of the third year of his term



of office; I therefore naturally looked forward to a stay of



but one year in Russia, and, when I left America, certainly



desired no more.  A little of Russian life goes very far.  It is



brilliant and attractive in many ways; but for a man who



feels that he has duties and interests in America it soon



becomes a sort of exile.  At the close of Mr. Harrison's



administration, therefore, I tendered my resignation, as is



customary with ministers abroad at such times, so that it



would arrive in Washington on the fourth day of March,



and then come under the hand of the new President, Mr.



Cleveland.  I had taken its acceptance as a matter of



course, and had made all my arrangements to leave Russia



on the arrival of my successor.  But soon I heard that



President Cleveland preferred that I should remain, and



that so long as I would consent to remain no new appointment



would be made.  In view of the fact that I had steadily



voted against him, and that he knew this, I felt his



conduct to be a mark of confidence for which I ought to be



grateful, and the result was that I continued at the post



another year, toward the close of which I wrote a private



letter to him, stating that under no circumstances could I



remain longer than the 1st of October, 1894.  The fact was



that the book which I considered the main work of my life



was very nearly finished.  I was anxious to have leisure to



give it thorough revision, and this leisure I could not have



in a diplomatic position.  Therefore it was that I insisted



on terminating my career at St. Petersburg, and that the



President finally accepted my declination in a letter which



I shall always prize.







During the following winter (1894-1895), at Florence



Sorrento, and Palermo, my time was steadily given to my



historical work; and having returned home and seen it



through the press, I turned to another historical treatise



which had been long deferred, and never did a man more



thoroughly enjoy his leisure.  I was at last apparently my



own master, and could work in the midst of my books and



in the library of the university to my heart's content.







But this fair dream was soon brought to naught.  In



December, 1895, I was appointed by President Cleveland



a member of the commission to decide upon the boundary



line between the British possessions in South America and



Venezuela.  The circumstances of the case, with the manner



in which he tendered me the position, forbade me to



decline it, and I saw no more literary leisure during the



following year.







As the presidential campaign of 1896 approached I had



given up all thoughts of politics, and had again resumed the



historical work to which I proposed to devote, mainly, the



rest of my life--the preparation of a biographical history



of modern Germany, for which I had brought together a



large amount of material and had prepared much manuscript. 



I also hoped to live long enough to put into shape



for publication a series of lectures, on which I had



obtained a mass of original material in France, upon ``The



Causes of the French Revolution''; and had the new campaign



been like any of those during the previous twenty



years, it would not have interested me.  But suddenly news



came of the nomination by the Democrats of Mr. Bryan. 



The circumstances attending this showed clearly that the



coming contest involved, distinctly, the question between



the forces of virtual repudiation, supporting a policy which



meant not merely national disaster but generations of 



dishonor on the one side, and, on the other, Mr. McKinley,



supporting a policy of financial honesty.  Having then



been called upon to preside over a Republican meeting at



Ithaca, I made a speech which was published and widely



circulated, giving the reasons why all thinking men of both



parties ought to rally in support of the Republican candidate,



and this I followed with an open letter to many leading



Democrats in the State.  It was begun as a private



letter to a valued Democratic friend, Mr. Oscar S. Straus,



who has twice proved himself a most useful and patriotic



minister of the United States at Constantinople.  But,



as my pen was moving, another Democratic friend came



into my mind, then another, and again another, until



finally my views were given in an open letter to them all;



and this having been submitted to a friend in New York,



with permission to use it as he thought best, he published



it.  The result seemed fortunate.  It was at once caught



up by the press and republished in all parts of the country. 



I cannot claim that the gentlemen to whom I wrote were



influenced by it, but certain it is that in spite of their



earnest differences from President McKinley on very important



questions, their feeling that this campaign involved



issues superior to any of those which had hitherto existed,



led all of them, either directly or indirectly, to



support him.







At the suggestion of various friends, I also republished



in a more extended form my pamphlet on ``Paper Money



Inflation in France:  How it Came, What it Brought, and



How it Ended,'' which had first been published at the



suggestion of General Garfield and others, as throwing light



on the results of a debased currency, and it was now widely



circulated in all parts of the country.







Mr. McKinley was elected, and thus, in my judgment,



was averted the greatest peril which our Republic has



encountered since the beginning of the Civil War.  Having



now some time for myself, I accepted sundry invitations



to address the students of two of the greater State universities



of the West.  It gave me pleasure to visit them, on



many accounts, and above all for the purpose of realizing



the magnificent advance that has been made by them in



becoming universities worthy of our country.







My anticipations were far more than met.  My old student



and successor at the University of Michigan as professor



and at Cornell University as president, Dr. Charles



Kendall Adams, welcomed me to the institution over which



he so worthily presided--the State University of Wisconsin;



and having visited it a quarter of a century before,



I was now amazed at its progress.  The subject of



my address, in the presence of the whole body of students



was ``Evolution versus Revolution in Politics,'' and never



have I spoken with more faith and hope.  Looking into



the faces of that immense assembly of students, in training



for the best work of their time, lifted me above all doubts



as the future of that commonwealth.







From Madison I went to Minneapolis under an invitation



to address the students at the State University of



Minnesota, and again my faith and hope were renewed as



I looked into the faces of those great audiences of young



men and young women.  They filled me with confidence



in the future of the country.  At Minneapolis I also met



various notable men, among them Archbishop Ireland,



who had interested me much at a former meeting in



Philadelphia.  I became sure that whatever ecclesiastics of his



church generally might feel toward the United States, he



was truly patriotic.  Alas for both church and state that



such prelates as Gibbons, Ireland, Keane, Spalding, and



the like, should be in a minority!







But my most curious experience was due to another



citizen of Minnesota.  Having been taken to the State



House, I was introduced, in the lower branch of the legislature,



to no less a personage than Mr. Ignatius Donnelly, so



widely known by his publications regarding the authorship



of Shakspere's writings; and on my asking him whether



he was now engaged on any literary work, he informed me



that he was about to publish a book which would leave no



particle of doubt, in the mind of any thinking man, that



the writings attributed to Shakspere were really due to



Francis Bacon.  During this conversation the house was



droning on in committee of the whole, and the proceedings



fell upon my ear much like the steady rumble of a mill; but



suddenly the mill seemed to stop, my own name was called,



and immediately afterward came the words:  ``Mr. ----



of ---- and Mr. ---- of ---- will escort Mr. White to



the chair.''  It was a very sudden awakening from my talk



with Mr. Donnelly on literature, but there was no help for



it.  ``Accoutred as I was, I plunged in,'' and, in a long fur-



lined coat much the worse for wear and bespattered with



mud, was conducted to the speaker, who, after formal



greetings, turned me loose on the audience.  Naturally my



speech revealed what was uppermost in my mind--wonder



at the progress made by the State, admiration for its



institutions, confidence in its future, pride in its relation to



the Union.  At the close of this brief talk a few members



set up a call for Mr. Donnelly to respond, whereupon he



promptly arose, and of all the speeches I have ever heard



his was certainly the most surprising.  It had seemed to



me that my own remarks had glorified Minnesota up to the



highest point; but they were tame indeed compared to his. 



Having first dosed me with blarney, he proceeded to deluge



the legislature with balderdash.  One part of his speech



ran substantially on this wise:







``Mr. Speaker, I ask the gentleman, when he returns to



his home, to tell his fellow-citizens of the East what he has



seen during his visit to this great State; and, sir, we also



wish him to tell them that Minnesota and the great Northwest



will no longer consent to be trodden under the feet



of the East.  The strength of the United States and the



future center of American greatness is here in Minnesota. 



Mr. Speaker, not far from this place I own a farm.''  (Here



I began to wonder what was coming next.)  ``From that



farm, on one side, the waters trickle down until they reach



the rivulets, and then the streams, and finally the great



rivers which empty into Hudson Bay.  And from the



other side of that farm, sir, the waters trickle down into



the rivulets, thence pass into the streams, and finally into



the great Father of Waters, until they reach the Gulf of



Mexico.  Mr. Speaker, on this plateau are now raised the



great men of the Republic.  Formerly Virginia was the



mother of statesmen; that is so no longer.  The mother of



statesmen in these days, and of the men who are to control



the destinies of this Republic, is Minnesota.''







Never before had I any conception of the height to which



``tall talk'' might attain.  It was the apotheosis of blather;



but as my eye wandered over the assemblage, I noticed



that many faces wore smiles, and it was clear to me that



the members had merely wished to exhibit their most



amusing specimen.







I felt that if they could stand it I could, and so, having



bidden the Speaker and Mr. Donnelly good-bye, passed out



and made the acquaintance of the neighboring city of St.



Paul, which struck me as even more beautiful than Edinburgh



in the views from its principal streets over hills,



valleys, and mountains.







At the University of Michigan, in view of my recent



visit, I did not again stop, but at Harvard and Yale I



addressed the students, and returned home from the excursion



with new faith in the future of the country.  James



Bryce is right when he declares that in our universities lie



the best hopes of the United States.







Early in the year following the election I was



appointed by the President ambassador to Germany.  I had



not sought the position; indeed, I had distinctly declined



to speak of the matter to any of those who were supposed



to have the management of political affairs in the State. 



It came to me, directly and unsought, from President



McKinley; I therefore prized it, and shall ever prize the



remembrance of it.







While it was announced as pending, I was urged by



various friends to speak of the subject to Mr. Platt, who



as the only Republican senator from New York and the



head of the Republican organization, was supposed to



have large rights in the matter.  It was hinted to me that



some statement to Mr. Platt on the subject was required



by political etiquette and would smooth the President's



way.  My answer was that I felt respect and friendship



for Mr. Platt; that I called at his rooms from time to



time socially, and discussed various public matters with



him; but that I could never make a request to him in the



premises; that I could not put myself in the attitude of a



suppliant, even in the slightest degree, to him or even to



the President.







The result was that the President himself spoke to Mr.



Platt on the subject, and, as I was afterward informed, the



senator replied that he would make no objection, but that



the appointment ought not to be charged against the claims



of the State of New York.







The presidential campaign of 1900, in which Mr. McKinley



was presented for re<e:>lection, touched me but slightly. 



There came various letters urging me to become a candidate



for the Vice-Presidency, and sundry newspapers presented



reasons for my nomination, the main argument



being the same which had been formerly used as regarded



the governorship of New York--that the German-Americans



were estranged from the Republican party by the



high tariff, and that I was the only Republican who could



draw them to the ticket.  All this I deprecated, and refused



to take any part in the matter, meantime writing my



nephew, who had become my successor in the State Senate,



my friend Dr. Holls, and others, to urge the, name of



Theodore Roosevelt.  I had known him for many years



and greatly admired him.  His integrity was proof against



all attack, his courage undoubted, and his vigor amazing. 



It was clear that he desired renomination for the place he



already held--the governorship of New York--partly



because he was devoted to certain reforms, which he could



carry out only in that position, and partly because he



preferred activity as governor of a great State to the usually



passive condition of a Vice-President of the United States. 



Moreover, he undoubtedly had aspirations to the Presidency. 



These were perfectly legitimate, and indeed hon-



orable, in him, as they are in any man who feels that he



has the qualities needed in that high office.  He and his



friends clearly felt that the transition from the governorship



of New York to the Presidency four years later would



be more natural than that from the Vice-Presidency; but



in my letters I insisted that his name would greatly



strengthen the national ticket, and that his road to the



Presidency seemed to me more easy from the Vice-Presidency



than from the governorship; that, although during



recent years Vice-Presidents had not been nominated to



the higher office, during former years they had been; and



that I could see no reason why he might not bring about



a return to the earlier custom.  As to myself, at my age, I



greatly preferred the duties of ambassador to those of



Vice-President.  The Republican party was wise enough



to take this view, and at the National Convention he was



nominated by acclamation.







Early in August, having taken a leave of absence for



sixty days, I arrived in New York, and on landing received



an invitation from Mr. Roosevelt to pass the day with him



at his house in the country.  I found him the same earnest,



energetic, straightforward man as of old.  Though nominated



to the Vice-Presidency against his will, he had



thrown himself heartily into the campaign; and the discussion



at his house turned mainly on the securing of a proper



candidate for the governorship of the State of New York. 



I recommended Charles Andrews, who, although in the



fullest vigor of mind and body, had been retired from the



chief-justiceship of the State on his arrival at the age of



seventy years.  This recommendation Mr. Roosevelt received



favorably; but later it was found impossible to



carry it out, the Republican organization in the State



having decided in favor of Mr. Odell.







During my entire stay in the United States I was



constantly occupied with arrears of personal business



which had been too long neglected; but, at the request of



various friends, wrote sundry open letters and articles,



which were widely circulated among German-Americans,



showing the injustice of the charge so constantly made



against President McKinley, of hostility to Germany and



German interests.  Nothing could be more absurd than



such an imputation.  The very opposite was the case.







I also gave a farewell address to a great assemblage of



students at Cornell University, my topic being ``The True



Conduct of Student Life''; but in the course of my speech,



having alluded to the importance of sobriety of judgment,



I tested by it sundry political contentions which were



strongly made on both sides, alluding especially to Goldwin



Smith's very earnest declaration that one of the



greatest dangers to our nation arises from plutocracy. 



I took pains to show that the whole spirit of our laws



is in favor of the rapid dispersion of great properties,



and that, within the remembrance of many present, a



large number of the greatest fortunes in the United States



had been widely dispersed.  As to other declarations



regarding dangers arising from the acquisition of foreign



territory and the like, I insisted that all these dangers were



as nothing compared to one of which we were then having



a striking illustration--namely, demagogism; and I urged,



what I have long deeply felt, that the main source of



danger to republican institutions is now, and always has



been, the demagogism which seeks to array labor against



capital, employee against employer, profession against



profession, class against class, section against section.  I



mentioned the name of no one; but it must have been clear



to all present how deeply I felt regarding the issues which



each party represented, and especially regarding the resort



to the lowest form of demagogism which Mr. Bryan was then 



making, in the desperate attempt to save his falling fortunes.







During this stay in America I made two visits to Washington



to confer with the President and the State Department. 



The first of these was during the hottest weather I



have ever known.  There were few people at the capital



who could leave it, and at the Arlington Hotel there



were not more than a dozen guests.  All were distressed



by the heat.  Moreover, there was an amazing complication



of political matters at this time, calculated to prostrate



the Washington officials, even if the heat had not done



so; and, among these, those relating to American control in



the Philippine Islands; the bitter struggle then going on in



China between the representatives of foreign powers,



including our own, and the Chinese insurrectionists; the



difficulties arising out of the successful result of the



Spanish War in Cuba; complications in the new administration



of Porto Rico; and the myriad of questions arising in a



heated political campaign, which was then running fast



and furious.







Arriving at the White House, I passed an hour with the



President, and found him, of all men in Washington, the



only one who seemed not at all troubled by the heat, by



the complications in China, by the difficulties in Cuba and



Porto Rico, or by the rush and whirl of the campaign.  He



calmly discussed with me the draft of a political note



which was to be issued next day in answer to the Russian



communications regarding the mode of procedure in



China, which had started some very trying questions; and



then showed me a letter from ex-President Cleveland



declining a position on the International Arbitration



Tribunal at the Hague, and accepted my suggestion not to



consider it a final answer, but to make another effort for



Mr. Cleveland's acceptance.  During this first visit of



mine, the Secretary of State and the First Assistant



Secretary were both absent, having been almost prostrated by



the extreme heat.  At a second visit in October, I again



saw the President, found him in the same equable frame of



mind, not allowing anything to trouble him, quietly



discharging his duties in the calm faith that all would turn



out well.  Dining with Secretary Hay, I mentioned this



equanimity of the President, when he said:  ``Yes; it is a



source of perpetual amazement to us all.  He allows no



question, no matter how complicated or vexatious, to disturb



him.  Some time since, at a meeting of the cabinet,



one of its members burst out into a bitter speech against



some government official who had been guilty of gross



rudeness, and said, `Mr. President, he has insulted you,



and he has insulted me'; thereupon the President said



calmly, `Mr. Secretary, if he has insulted ME, I forgive him; 



if he has insulted you, I shall remove him from office.' ''







Newspapers were teeming with misrepresentations of



the President's course, but they failed to ruffle him.  On



his asking if I was taking any part in the campaign, I



referred to a speech that I had made on the Fourth of July



in Leipsic, and another to the Cornell University students



just before my departure, with the remark that I felt that



a foreign diplomatic representative coming home and



throwing himself eagerly into the campaign might possibly



do more harm than good.  In this remark he acquiesced,



and said:  ``I shall not, myself, make any speeches



whatever; nor shall I give any public receptions.  My record



is before the American people, and they must pass



judgment upon it.  In this respect I shall go back to what



seems to me the better practice of the early Presidents.'' 



I was struck by the justice of this, and told him so,



although I felt obliged to say that he would be under fearful



temptation to speak before the campaign had gone much



farther.  He smiled, but held to his determination, despite



the fact that his opponent invaded all parts of the Union



in an oratorical frenzy, in one case making a speech at



half-past two in the morning to a crowd assembled at a



railway station, and making during one day thirty-one



speeches, teeming with every kind of campaign misrepresentation;



but the President was faithful to his promise,



uttered no word in reply, and was re<e:>lected.







Not only at home, but abroad, as I can amply testify, the



news of his re<e:>lection was received with general satisfaction,



and most of all by those who wish well to our country



and cherish hopes that government by the people and for



the people may not be brought to naught by the wild



demagogism which has wrecked all great republics thus



far.







But alas! the triumph was short-lived.  One morning



in September, while I was slowly recovering from two of



the greatest bereavements which have ever befallen me,



came the frightful news of his assassination.  Shortly



afterward, for family and business reasons, I went for a



few weeks to the United States, and, in the course of my



visit, conferred with the new President three times--first



at the Yale bicentennial celebration, afterward in his



private office, and finally at his table in the White House. 



Hard indeed was it for me to realize what had taken place



--that President McKinley, whom I had so recently seen in



his chair at the head of the cabinet table, was gone forever;



that in those rooms, where I had, at four different times,



chatted pleasantly with him, he was never to be seen



more; and that here, in that same seat, was sitting my old



friend and co-laborer.  Hard was it to realize that the last



time I had met Mr. Roosevelt in that same room was when



we besought President Harrison to extend the civil service. 



Interesting as the new President's conversation was,



there was constantly in my mind, whether in his office or



his parlors or the dining-room at the White House, one



deep undertone.  It was like the pedal bass of an organ,



steadily giving the ground tone of a requiem--the vanity



and evanescence of all things earthly.  There had I seen,



in the midst of their jubilant supporters, Pierce, Lincoln,



Grant, Hayes, Garfield, Cleveland, Harrison, and, finally,



so short a time before, McKinley.  It seemed all a dream. 



In his conversations the new President showed the same



qualities that I had before known in him--earnestness,



vigor, integrity, fearlessness, and, at times, a sense of



humor, blending playfully with his greater qualities.  The



message he gave me to the Emperor William was characteristic. 



I was naturally charged to assure the Emperor of



the President's kind feeling; but to this was added, in a



tone of unmistakable truth:  ``Tell him that when I say



this, I mean it.  I have been brought up to admire and



respect Germany.  My life in that country and my reading



since have steadily increased this respect and admiration.'' 



I noticed on the table a German book which he had just



been reading, its author being my old friend Professor



Hans Delbr<u:>ck of the Berlin University.  At the close of



the message, which referred to sundry matters of current



business, came a playful postlude.  ``Tell his Majesty,''



said the President, ``that I am a hunter and, as such, envy



him one thing especially: he has done what I have never



yet been able to do--he has killed a whale.  But say to



him that if he will come to the United States, I will take



him to the Rocky Mountains to hunt the mountain lions,



which is no bad sport,--and that if he kills one, as he



doubtless will, he will be the first monarch who has killed



a lion since Tiglath-Pileser.''  I need hardly add that



when, a few weeks later, I delivered the message to



the Emperor at Potsdam, it pleased him.  Many people



on both sides of the Atlantic have noted a similarity in



qualities between these two rulers, and, from close



observation, I must confess that this is better founded than are



most such attributed resemblances.  The Emperor has



indeed several accomplishments, more especially in artistic



matters, which, so far as I can learn, the President has



not; but both are ambitious in the noblest sense; both are



young men of deep beliefs and high aims; earnest, vigorous,



straightforward, clear-sighted; good speakers, yet



sturdy workers, and anxious for the prosperity, but above



all things jealous for the honor of the people whose



affairs they are called to administer.  The President's



accounts of difficulties in finding men for responsible



positions in various branches of the service, and his clear



statements of the proper line to be observed in political



dealings between the United States and Europe where



South American interests were concerned, showed him to



be a broad-minded statesman.  During my stay with him,



we also discussed one or two points in his forthcoming



message to Congress, and in due time it was received at



Berlin, attracting general respect and admiration in Germany,



as throughout Europe generally.

















PART V







IN THE DIPLOMATIC SERVICE











CHAPTER XXVI







AS ATTACH<E'> AT ST. PETERSBURG--1854-1855







While yet an undergraduate at Yale, my favorite



studies in history and some little attention to



international law led me to take special interest in the



diplomatic relations between modern states; but it never



occurred to me that I might have anything to do directly



with them.







Having returned to New Haven after my graduation,



intending to give myself especially to modern languages



as a preparation for travel and historical study abroad,



I saw one day, from my window in North College, my



friend Gilman, then of the class above mine, since



president of Johns Hopkins University and of the Carnegie



Institution, rushing along in great haste, and, on going out



to greet him, learned that he had been invited by Governor



Seymour of Connecticut, the newly appointed minister



to Russia, to go with him as an attach<e'>, and that, at his



suggestion, a similar invitation would be extended to me. 







While in doubt on the matter, I took the train for New



York to consult my father, and, entering a car, by a happy



chance found the only vacant place at the side of the



governor.  I had never seen him, except on the platform at my



graduation, three months before; but on my introducing



myself, he spoke kindly of my argument on that occasion,



which, as he was ``pro-slavery'' and I ``anti-slavery,'' I



had supposed he would detest; then talked pleasantly on



various subjects, and, on our separating at New York,



invited me so cordially to go to Russia with him that I then



and there decided to do so, and, on meeting my father,



announced my decision.







On the 10th of December, 1853, I sailed for England, with



Gilman, and in London awaited Governor Seymour, who,



at the last moment, had decided not to leave Washington



until the Senate had confirmed his nomination; but this



delay proved to be fortunate, for thereby opportunity was



afforded me to see some interesting men, and especially



Mr. Buchanan, who had previously been minister to Russia,



was afterward President of the United States, and



was at that time minister at the court of St. James.  He



was one of the two or three best talkers I have ever known,



and my first knowledge of his qualities in this respect was



gained at a great dinner given in his honor by Mr. George



Peabody, the banker.  A day or two before, our minister



in Spain, Mr. Soul<e'>, and his son had each fought a duel,



one with the French ambassador, the Marquis de Turgot,



and the other with the Duke of Alba, on account of a



supposed want of courtesy to Mrs. Soul<e'>; and the



conversation being directed somewhat by this event, I recall



Mr. Buchanan's reminiscences of duels which he had



known during his long public life as among the most



interesting I have ever heard on any subject.







Shortly after the arrival of Governor Seymour, we went



on to Paris, and there, placing myself in the family of a



French professor, I remained, while the rest of the party



went on to St. Petersburg; my idea being to hear lectures



on history and kindred subjects, thus to fit myself by



fluency in French for service in the attach<e'>ship, and, 



by other knowledge, for later duties.







After staying in France for nearly a year, having



received an earnest request from Governor Seymour to



come on to Russia before the beginning of the winter, I



left Paris about the middle of October and went by way of



Berlin.  In those days there was no railroad beyond the



eastern frontier of Prussia, and, as the Crimean War was



going on, there was a blockade in force which made it



impossible to enter Russia by sea; consequently I had



seven days and seven nights of steady traveling in a post-



coach after entering the Russian Empire.







Arriving at the Russian capital on the last day of



October, 1854, I was most heartily welcomed by the minister,



who insisted that I should enjoy all the privileges of



residence with him.  Among the things to which I now



look back as of the greatest value to me, is this stay of



nearly a year under his roof.  The attach<e'>ship, as it existed



in those days, was in many ways a good thing and in



no way evil; but it was afterward abolished by Congress



on the ground that certain persons had abused its privileges. 



I am not alone in believing that it could again be



made of real service to the country: one of the best



secretaries of state our country has ever had, Mr. Hamilton



Fish, once expressed to me his deep regret at its suppression.







Under the system which thus prevailed at that time



young men of sufficient means, generally from the leading



universities, were secured to aid the minister, without any



cost to the government, their only remuneration being an



opportunity to see the life and study the institutions of



the country to which the minister was accredited.







The duty of an attach<e'> was to assist the minister in



securing information, in conducting correspondence, and



in carrying on the legation generally; he was virtually an



additional secretary of legation, and it was a part of my



duty to act as interpreter.  As such I was constantly called



to accompany the minister in his conferences with his



colleagues as well as with the ministers of the Russian



government, and also to be present at court and at ceremonial



interviews: this was of course very interesting to me.  In



the intervals of various duties my time was given largely



to studying such works upon Russia and especially upon



Russian history as were accessible, and the recent history



was all the more interesting from the fact that some of



the men who had taken a leading part in it were still upon



the stage.  One occasion especially comes back to me



when, finding myself at an official function near an old



general who was allowed to sit while all the others stood,



I learned that he was one of the few still surviving who



had taken a leading part in the operations against Napoleon,



in 1812, at Moscow.







It was the period of the Crimean War, and at our legation



there were excellent opportunities for observing not



only society at large, but the struggle then going on



between Russia on one side, and Great Britain, France,



Italy, and Turkey on the other.







The main duties of the American representative were to



keep his own government well informed, to guard the



interests of his countrymen, and not only to maintain, but



to develop, the friendly relations that had existed for



many years between Russia and the United States.  A



succession of able American ministers had contributed to



establish these relations: among them two who afterward



became President of the United States--John Quincy



Adams and James Buchanan, George Mifflin Dallas, who



afterward became Vice-President; John Randolph of Roanoke;



and a number of others hardly less important in



the history of our country.  Fortunately, the two nations



were naturally inclined to peaceful relations; neither had



any interest antagonistic to the other, and under these



circumstances the course of the minister was plain: it was



to keep his government out of all entanglements, and at



the same time to draw the two countries more closely



together.  This our minister at that time was very successful



in doing: his relations with the leading Russians,



from the Emperor down, were all that could be desired,



and to the work of men like him is largely due the fact



that afterward, in our great emergency during the Civil



War, Russia showed an inclination to us that probably had



something to do with holding back the powers of western



Europe from recognizing the Southern Confederacy.







To the feeling thus created is also due, in some measure,



the transfer of Alaska, which has proved fortunate, in



spite of our halting and unsatisfactory administration of



that region thus far.







The Czar at that period, Nicholas I, was a most



imposing personage, and was generally considered the most



perfect specimen of a human being, physically speaking,



in all Europe.  At court, in the vast rooms filled with



representatives from all parts of the world, and at the



great reviews of his troops, he loomed up majestically,



and among the things most strongly impressed upon



my memory is his appearance as I saw him, just before



his death, driving in his sledge and giving the military



salute.







Nor was he less majestic in death.  In the spring of 1855



he yielded very suddenly to an attack of pneumonia,



doubtless rendered fatal by the depression due to the ill



success of the war into which he had rashly plunged;



and a day or two afterward it was made my duty to attend,



with our minister, at the Winter Palace, the first



presentation of the diplomatic corps to the new Emperor,



Alexander II.  The scene was impressive.  The foreign



ministers having been arranged in a semicircle, with their



secretaries and attach<e'>s beside them, the great doors were



flung open, and the young Emperor, conducted by his



Minister of Foreign Affairs, Count Nesselrode, entered



the room.  Tears were streaming down his cheeks, and he



gave his address with deep feeling.  He declared that if



the Holy Alliance made in 1815 had been broken, it was



not the fault of Russia; that though he longed for peace,



if terms should be insisted upon by the Western powers, at



the approaching Paris conference, incompatible with Russian



honor, he would put himself at the head of his faithful



country,--would retreat into Siberia,--would die rather



than yield.







Then occurred an incident especially striking.  From



Austria, which only seven years before had been saved by



Russia from destruction in the Austro-Hungarian revolution,



Russia had expected, in ordinary gratitude, at least



some show of neutrality.  But it had become evident that



gratitude had not prevented Austria from secretly joining



the hostile nations; therefore it was that, in the course of



the address, the Emperor, turning to the Austrian



representative, Count Esterhazy, addressed him with the



greatest severity, hinted at the ingratitude of his government,



and insisted on Russia's right to a different return. 



During all this part of the address the Emperor Alexander



fastened his eyes upon those of the Austrian minister and



spoke in a manner much like that which the head of a



school would use toward a school-boy caught in misdoing. 



At the close of this speech came the most perfect example



of deportment I had ever seen: the Austrian minister,



having looked the Czar full in the face, from first to last,



without the slightest trace of feeling, bowed solemnly,



respectfully, with the utmost deliberation, and then stood



impassive, as if words had not been spoken destined to



change the traditional relations between the two great



neighboring powers, and to produce a bitterness which,



having lasted through the latter half of the nineteenth



century, bids fair to continue far into the twentieth.







Knowing the importance of this speech as an indication



to our government of what was likely to be the course of



the Emperor, I determined to retain it in my mind; and,



although my verbal memory has never been retentive, I



was able, on returning to our legation, to write the whole



of it, word for word.  In the form thus given, it was



transmitted to our State Department, where, a few years



since, when looking over sundry papers, I found it.







Immediately after this presentation the diplomatic



corps proceeded to the room in which the body of Nicholas



lay in state.  Heaped up about the coffin were the jeweled



crosses and orders which had been sent him by the various



monarchs of the world, and, in the midst of them, the



crowns and scepters of all the countries he had ruled,



among them those of Siberia, Astrakhan, Kazan, Poland,



the Crimea, and, above all, the great crown and scepter of



the empire.  At his feet two monks were repeating prayers



for the dead; his face and form were still as noble and



unconquerable as ever.







His funeral dwells in my memory as the most imposing



pageant I had ever seen.  When his body was carried from



the palace to the Fortress Church, it was borne between



double lines of troops standing closely together on each



side of the avenues for a distance of five miles; marshals



of the empire carried the lesser crowns and imperial



insignia before his body; and finally were borne the great



imperial crown, orb, and scepter, the masses of jewels in



them, and especially the Orloff diamond swinging in the



top of the scepter, flashing forth vividly on that bright



winter morning, and casting their rays far along the



avenues.  Behind the body walked the Emperor Alexander



and the male members of the imperial family.







Later came the burial in the Fortress Church of St.



Peter and St. Paul, on the island of the Neva, nearly



opposite the Winter Palace.  That, too, was most imposing. 



Choirs had been assembled from the four great cathedrals



of the empire, and their music was beyond dreams.  At



the proper point in the service, the Emperor and his



brothers, having taken the body of their father from its



coffin and wrapped it in a shroud of gold cloth, carried it



to the grave near that of Peter the Great, at the right of



the high altar; and, as it was laid to rest, and beautiful



music rose above us, the guns of the fortress on all sides



of the church sounded the battle-roll until the whole



edifice seemed to rock upon its foundations.  Never had I



imagined a scene so impressive.







Among the persons with whom it was my duty to deal,



in behalf of our representative, was the Prime Minister of



Russia,--the Minister of Foreign Affairs,--Count Nesselrode. 



He was at that period the most noted diplomatist



in the world; for, having been associated with Talleyrand,



Metternich, and their compeers at the Congress of Vienna,



he was now the last of the great diplomatists of the



Napoleonic period.  He received me most kindly and said, ``So



you are beginning a diplomatic career?''  My answer was



that I could not begin it more fitly than by making the



acquaintance of the Nestor of diplomacy, or words to that



effect, and these words seemed to please him.  Whenever



he met me afterward his manner was cordial, and he



seemed always ready to do all in his power to favor the



best relations between the two countries.







The American colony in Russia at that period was



small, and visitors were few; but some of these enlivened



us.  Of the more interesting were Colonel Samuel Colt of



Hartford, inventor of the revolver which bears his name,



and his companion, Mr. Dickerson, eminent as an expert



in mechanical matters and an authority on the law of



patents.  They had come into the empire in the hope of



making a contract to supply the Russians with improved



arms such as the allies were beginning to use against them



in the Crimea; but the heavy conservatism of Russian



officials thwarted all their efforts.  To all representations



as to the importance of improved arms the answer was,



``Our soldiers are too ignorant to use anything but the



old `brown Bess.' ''  The result was that the Russian



soldiers were sacrificed by thousands; their inferiority



in arms being one main cause of their final defeat.







That something better than this might have been



expected was made evident to us all one day when I



conducted these gentlemen through the Imperial Museum of



the Hermitage, adjoining the Winter Palace.  After looking



through the art collections we went into the room



where were preserved the relics of Peter the Great, and



especially the machines of various sorts made for him by



the mechanics whom he called to his aid from Holland and



other Western countries.  These machines were not then



shut up in cases, as they now are, but were placed about



the room and easy of access.  Presently I heard Mr. Dickerson



in a loud voice call out:  ``Good God!  Sam, come



here!  Only look at this!''  On our going to him, he



pointed out to us a lathe for turning irregular forms and



another for copying reliefs, with specimens of work still



in them.  ``Look at that,'' he said.  ``Here is Blanchard's



turning-lathe, which only recently has been reinvented,



which our government uses in turning musket-stocks, and



which is worth a fortune.  Look at those reliefs in this



other machine; here is the very lathe for copying sculpture



that has just been reinvented, and is now attracting so



much attention at Paris.''







These machines had stood there in the gallery, open to



everybody, ever since the death of Peter, two hundred



years before, and no human being had apparently ever



taken the trouble to find the value of them.







But there came Americans of a very different sort, and



no inconsiderable part of our minister's duties was to keep



his hot-headed fellow-citizens from embroiling our country



with the militant powers.







A very considerable party in the United States leaned



toward Russia and sought to aid her secretly, if not



openly.  This feeling was strongest in our Southern States



and among the sympathizers with slavery in our Northern



States, a main agent of it in St. Petersburg being Dr.



Cottman of New Orleans, and its main causes being the



old dislike of Great Britain, and the idea among pro-slavery



fanatics that there was a tie between their part of



our country and Russia arising from the fact that while



the American Republic was blessed with slavery, the



Russian Empire was enjoying the advantages of the serf



system.  This feeling might have been very different had



these sympathizers with Russia been aware that at this



very moment Alexander II was planning to abolish the



serf system throughout his whole empire; but as it was,



their admiration for Russia knew no bounds, and they



even persuaded leading Russians that it would not be a



difficult matter to commit America to the cause of Russia,



even to aiding her with arms, men, and privateers.







This made the duty of the American minister at times



very delicate; for, while showing friendliness to Russia,



he had to thwart the efforts of her over-zealous American



advocates.  Moreover, constant thought had to be exercised



for the protection of American citizens then within



the empire.  Certain Russian agents had induced a number



of young American physicians and surgeons who had



been studying in Paris to enter the Russian army, and



these, having been given pay and rapid advancement, in



the hope that this would strengthen American feeling



favorable to the Russian cause, were naturally hated by



the Russian surgeons; hence many of these young



compatriots of ours were badly treated,--some so severely



that they died,--and it became part of our minister's duty



to extricate the survivors from their unfortunate position. 



More than once, on returning with him from an interview



with the Minister of War, I saw tears in Governor



Seymour's eyes as he dwelt upon the death of some of these



young fellows whom he had learned to love during their



stay in St. Petersburg.







The war brought out many American adventurers, some



of them curiosities of civilization, and this was especially



the case with several who had plans for securing victory



to Russia over the Western powers.  All sorts of nostrums



were brought in by all sorts of charlatans, and the efforts



of the minister and his subordinates to keep these gentlemen



within the limits of propriety in their dealings with



one another and with the Russian authorities were at



times very arduous.  On one occasion, the main functionaries



of the Russian army having been assembled with



great difficulty to see the test of a new American invention



in artillery, it was found that the inventor's rival had



stolen some essential part of the gun, and the whole thing



was a vexatious failure.







One man who came out with superb plans brought a



militia colonel's commission from the governor of a Western



State and the full uniform of a major-general.  At



first he hesitated to clothe himself in all his glory, and



therefore went through a process of evolution, beginning



first with part of his uniform and then adding more as



his courage rose.  During this process he became the



standing joke of St. Petersburg; but later, when he had



emerged in full and final splendor, he became a man of



mark indeed, so much so that serious difficulties arose. 



Throughout the city are various corps de garde, and the



sentinel on duty before each of these, while allowed merely



to present arms to an officer of lower rank, must, whenever



he catches sight of a general officer, call out the entire



guard to present arms with the beating of drums.  Here



our American was a source of much difficulty, for whenever



any sentinel caught sight of his gorgeous epaulets in



the distance the guard was instantly called out, arms



presented, and drums beaten, much to the delight of our



friend, but even more to the disgust of the generals of the



Russian army and to the troops, who thus rendered absurd



homage and found themselves taking part in something



like a bit of comic opera.







Another example was also interesting.  A New York



ward leader--big, rough, and rosy--had come out as an



agent for an American breech-loading musket company,



and had smuggled specimens of arms over the frontier. 



Arriving in St. Petersburg, he was presented to the



Emperor, and after receiving handsome testimonials, was put



in charge of two aides-de-camp, who took him and his



wife about, in court carriages, to see the sights of the



Russian capital.  At the close of his stay, wishing to make



some return for this courtesy, he gave these two officers



a dinner at his hotel.  Our minister declined his invitation,



but allowed the secretary and me to accept it, and



we very gladly availed ourselves of this permission. 



Arriving at his rooms, we were soon seated at a table



splendidly furnished.  At the head of it was the wife of our



entertainer, and at her right one of the Russian officials,



in gorgeous uniform; at the other end of our table was



our host, and at his right the other Russian official, splendidly



attired; beside the first official sat our secretary, and



beside the other was the place assigned to me.  The dinner



was successful: all spoke English, and all were happy;



but toward the end of it our host, having perhaps taken



more wine than was his wont, grew communicative, and, as



ill luck would have it, the subject of the conversation



became personal courage, whereupon he told a story.  Recalling



his experience as a deputy sheriff of New York, he



said:







``When those river pirates who murdered a sailor in



New York harbor had to be hanged, the sheriff of the



county hadn't the courage to do it and ordered me to



hang them.  I rather hated the business, but I made everything



ready, and when the time came I took an extra glass



of brandy, cut the rope, and off they swung.''







The two Russians started back in consternation.  Not



all their politeness could conceal it: horror of horrors,



they were dining with a hangman!  Besides their sense



of degradation in this companionship, superstitions had



been bred in them which doubled their distress.  A dead



silence fell over all.  I was the first to break it by



remarking to my Russian neighbor:







``You may perhaps not know, sir, that in the State of



New York the taking of life by due process of law is



considered so solemn a matter that we intrust it to the



chief executive officers of our counties,--to our sheriffs,--



and not to hangmen or executioners.''







He looked at me very solemnly as I announced this



truth, and then, after a solemn pause, gasped out in a



dubious, awe-struck voice, ``Merci bien, monsieur.''  But



this did not restore gaiety to the dinner.  Henceforth it



was cold indeed, and at the earliest moment possible the



Russian officials bowed themselves out, and no doubt, for



a long time afterward, ascribed any ill luck which befell



them to this scene of ill omen.







Another case in which this irrepressible compatriot



figured was hardly less peculiar.  Having decided to



return to America, and the blockade being still in force, he



secured a place in the post-coach for the seven days and



seven nights' journey to the frontier.  The opportunities



to secure such passages were few and far between, since



this was virtually the only public conveyance out of the



empire.  As he was obliged to have his passport vis<e'>d



at the Russian Foreign Office in order that he might leave



the country, it had been sent by the legation to the Russian



authorities a fortnight before his departure, but



under various pretexts it was retained, and at last did not



arrive in time.  When the hour of departure came he was



at the post-house waiting for his pass, and as he had been



assured that it would duly reach him, he exerted himself



in every way to delay the coach.  He bribed one subordinate



after another; but at last the delay was so long and



the other passengers so impatient that one of the higher



officials appeared upon the scene and ordered the coach to



start.  At this our American was wild with rage and



began a speech in German and English--so that all the



officials might understand it--on Russian officials and on



the empire in general.  A large audience having gathered



around him, he was ordered to remove his hat.  At this



he held it on all the more firmly, declared himself an



American, and defied the whole power of the empire to



remove it.  He then went on to denounce everything in



Russia, from the Emperor down.  He declared that the



officials were a pack of scoundrels; that the only reason



why he did not obtain his passport was that he had not



bribed them as highly as they expected; that the empire



ought to be abolished; that he hoped the Western powers



in the war then going on would finish it--indeed, that he



thought they would.







There was probably some truth in his remark as to the



inadequate bribing of officials; but the amazing thing was



that his audience were so paralyzed by his utterances and



so overawed by his attitude that they made no effort to



arrest him.  Then came a new scene.  While they were



standing before him thus confounded, he suddenly turned



to the basket of provisions which he had laid in for his



seven days' journey, and began pelting his audience,



including the official above named, with its contents,



hurling sandwiches, oranges, and finally even roast chickens,



pigeons, and partridges, at their devoted heads.  At



last, pressing his hat firmly over his brows, he strode



forth to the legation unmolested.  There it took some



labor to cool his wrath; but his passport having finally



been obtained, we secured for him permission to use post-



horses, and so he departed from the empire.







To steer a proper course in the midst of such fellow-



citizens was often difficult, and I recall multitudes of other



examples hardly less troublesome; indeed, the career of



this same deputy sheriff at St. Petersburg was full of



other passages requiring careful diplomatic intervention



to prevent his arrest.







Luckily for these gentlemen, the Russian government



felt, just at that time, special need of maintaining friendly



relations with the powers not at war with her, and the



public functionaries of all sorts were evidently ordered



to treat Americans with extreme courtesy and forbearance.







One experience of this was somewhat curious.  Our first



secretary of legation and I, having gone on Easter eve to



the midnight mass at the Kazan cathedral, we were shown



at once into a place of honor in front of the great silver



iconostase and stationed immediately before one of the



doors opening through it into the inner sanctuary.  At



first the service went on in darkness, only mitigated by



a few tapers at the high altar; but as the clock struck the



hour of midnight there came suddenly the roaring of the



fortress guns, the booming of great bells above and



around us, and a light, which appeared at the opposite



end of the cathedral, seemed to shoot in all directions,



leaving trains of fire, until all was ablaze, every person



present holding a lighted taper.  Then came the mass,



celebrated by a bishop and his acolytes gorgeously



attired, with the swinging of censers, not only toward the



ecclesiastics, but toward the persons of importance present,



among whom we were evidently included.  Suddenly



there came a dead stop, stillness, and an evident



atmosphere of embarrassment.  Then the ceremony began again,



and again the censers were swung toward us, and again



a dead stop.  Everything seemed paralyzed.  Presently



there came softly to my side a gentleman who said in a



low tone, ``You are of the American legation?''  I



answered in the affirmative.  He said, ``This is a very



interesting ceremony.''  To this I also assented.  He then said,



``Is this the first time you have seen it?''  ``Yes,'' I



answered; ``we have never been in Russia at Easter before.'' 



He then took very formal leave, and again the ceremony



was revived, again the clouds of incense rose, and again



came the dead stop.  Presently the same gentleman came



up again, gently repeated very much the same questions



as before, and receiving the same answers, finally said,



with some embarrassment:  ``Might I ask you to kindly



move aside a little?  A procession has been waiting for



some time back of this door, and we are very anxious to



have it come out into the church.''  At this Secretary



Erving and I started aside instantly, much chagrined to



think that we had caused such a stoppage in such a ceremony;



the doors swung open, and out came a brilliant



procession of ecclesiastics with crosses, censers, lights, and



banners.







Not all of our troubles were due to our compatriots. 



Household matters sometimes gave serious annoyance. 



The minister had embraced a chance very rare in Russia,



--one which, in fact, almost never occurs,--and had



secured a large house fully furnished, with the servants,



who, from the big chasseur who stood at the back of the



minister's sledge to the boy who blew the organ on which



I practised, were serfs, and all, without exception, docile,



gentle, and kindly.  But there was one standing enemy



--vodka.  The feeling of the Russian peasant toward the



rough corn-brandy of his own country is characteristic. 



The Russian language is full of diminutives expressive



of affection.  The peasant addresses his superior as



Batushka, the affectionate diminutive of the word which



means father; he addresses the mistress of the house as



Matushka, which is the affectionate diminutive of the



Russian word for mother.  To his favorite drink, brandy, he



has given the name which is the affectionate diminutive



of the word voda, water--namely, vodka, which really



means ``dear little water.''  Vodka was indeed our most



insidious foe, and gave many evidences of its power; but



one of them made an unwonted stir among us.







One day the minister, returning in his carriage from



making sundry official visits, summoned the housekeeper,



a Baltic-province woman who had been admirably brought



up in an English family, and said to her:  `` Annette I insist



that you discharge Ivan, the coachman, at once; I can't



stand him any longer.  This afternoon he raced, with me in



the carriage, up and down the Nevsky, from end to end, with



the carriages of grand dukes and ministers, and, do my



best, I could not stop him.  He simply looked back at me,



grinned like an idiot, and drove on with all his might. 



It is the third time he has done this.  I have pardoned



him twice on his solemn pledge that he would do better;



but now he must go.''  Annette assented, and in the evening



after dinner came in to tell the minister that Ivan was



going, but wished to beg his pardon and say farewell.







The minister went out rather reluctantly, the rest of us



following; but he had hardly reached the anteroom when



Ivan, a great burly creature with a long flowing beard and



caftan, rushed forward, groveled before him, embraced



his ankles, laid his head upon his feet, and there remained



mumbling and moaning.  The minister was greatly



embarrassed and nervously ejaculated:  ``Take him away! 



Take him away!''  But all to no purpose.  Ivan could



not be induced to relax his hold.  At last the minister



relented and told Annette to inform Ivan that he would



receive just one more trial, and that if he failed again he



would be sent away to his owner without having any



opportunity to apologize or to say good-bye.







Very interesting to me were the houses of some of the



British residents, and especially that of Mr. Baird, the



head of the iron-works which bore his name, and which,



at that time, were considered among the wonders of Russia. 



He was an interesting character.  Noticing, among



the three very large and handsome vases in his dining-



room, the middle one made up of the bodies of three



large eagles in oxidized silver with crowns of gold,



I was told its history.  When the Grand Duke Alexander



--who afterward became the second emperor of that



name--announced his intention of joining the St. Petersburg



Yacht Club, a plan was immediately formed to



provide a magnificent trophy and allow him to win it,



and to this plan all the members of the club agreed except



Baird.  He at once said:  ``No; if the grand duke's yacht



can take it, let him have it; if not, let the best yacht win. 



If I can take it, I shall.''  It was hoped that he would think



better of it, but when the day arrived, the other yachts



having gradually fallen back, Mr. Baird continued the



race with the grand duke and won.  As a result he was



for some years in disfavor with the high officials



surrounding the Emperor--a disfavor that no doubt cost



him vast sums; but he always asserted that he was glad



he had insisted on his right.







On one occasion I was witness to a sad faux pas at his



dinner-table.  It was in the early days of the Crimean



War, and an American gentleman who was present was



so careless as to refer to Queen Victoria's proclamation



against all who aided the enemy, which was clearly leveled



at Mr. Baird and his iron-works.  There was a scene at



once.  The ladies almost went into hysterics in deprecation



of the position in which the proclamation had placed



them.  But Mr. Baird himself was quite equal to the



occasion: in a very up-and-down way he said that he of



course regretted being regarded as a traitor to his country,



but that in the time of the alliance against the first



Napoleon his father had been induced by the Russian



government to establish works, and this not merely with the



consent, but with the warm approval, of the British



government; in consequence the establishment had taken



contracts with the Russian government and now they must be



executed; so far as he was concerned his conscience was



entirely clear; his duty was plain, and he was going to



do it.







On another occasion at his table there was a very good



repartee.  The subject of spiritualism having been brought



up, some one told a story of a person who, having gone



into an unfrequented garret of an old family residence,



found that all the old clothing which had been stored there



during many generations had descended from the shelves



and hooks and had assumed kneeling postures about the



floor.  All of us heard the story with much solemnity,



when good old Dr. Law, chaplain of the British church,



broke the silence with the words, ``That must have been



a family of very PIOUS HABITS.''  This of course broke the



spell.







I should be sorry to have it thought that all my stay



in the Russian capital was given up to official routine and



social futilities.  Fortunately for me, the social demands



were not very heavy.  The war in the Crimea, steadily



going against Russia, threw a cloud over the court and



city and reduced the number of entertainments to a



minimum.  This secured me, during the long winter evenings,



much time for reading, and in addition to all the valuable



treatises I could find on Russia, I went with care through



an extensive course in modern history.







As to Russian matters, it was my good fortune to become



intimately acquainted with Atkinson, the British



traveler in Siberia.  He had brought back many portfolios



of sketches, and his charming wife had treasured up a



great fund of anecdotes of people and adventure, so that



I seemed for a time to know Siberia as if I had lived there. 



Then it was that I learned of the beauties and capabilities



of its southern provinces.  The Atkinsons had also



brought back their only child, a son born on the Siberian



steppe, a wonderfully bright youngster, whom they destined



for the British navy.  He bore a name which I fear



may at times have proved a burden to him, for his father



and mother were so delighted with the place in which he



was born that they called him, after it, ``Alatow-Tam



Chiboulak.''[10]











[10] Since writing the above, I have had the pleasure of



receiving a letter from this gentleman, who has for some time



held the responsible and interesting position of superintendent



of public instruction in the Hawaiian Islands, his son, a



graduate of the University of Michigan, having been Secretary



of the Territory.















The general Russian life, as I thus saw it, while intensely



interesting in many respects, was certainly not cheerful. 



Despite the frivolity dominant among the upper class and



the fetishism controlling the lower classes, there was,



especially in that period of calamity, a deep undertone of



melancholy.  Melancholy, indeed, is a marked characteristic



of Russia, and, above all, of the peasantry.  They



seem sad even in their sports; their songs, almost without



exception, are in the minor key; the whole atmosphere is



apparently charged with vague dread of some calamity. 



Despite the suppression of most of the foreign journals,



and the blotting out of page after page of the newspapers



allowed to enter the empire, despite all that the secret



police could do in repressing unfavorable comment, it



became generally known that all was going wrong in the



Crimea.  News came of reverse after reverse: of the



defeats of the Alma and Inkerman, and, as a climax, the loss



of Sebastopol and the destruction of the Russian fleet.  In



the midst of it all, as is ever the case in Russian wars,



came utter collapse in the commissariat department;



everywhere one heard hints and finally detailed stories



of scoundrelism in high places: of money which ought to



have been appropriated to army supplies, but which had



been expended at the gambling-tables of Homburg or in



the Breda quarter at Paris.







Then it was that there was borne in upon me the conviction



that Russia, powerful as she seems when viewed from



the outside, is anything but strong when viewed from the



inside.  To say nothing of the thousand evident weaknesses



resulting from autocracy,--the theory that one man, and



he, generally, not one of the most highly endowed, can do



the thinking for a hundred millions of people,--there was



nowhere the slightest sign of any uprising of a great nation,



as, for instance, of the French against Europe in



1792, of the Germans against France in 1813 and in 1870,



of Italy against Austria in 1859 and afterward, and of the



Americans in the Civil War of 1861.  There were certainly



many noble characters in Russia, and these must



have felt deeply the condition of things; but there being



no great middle class, and the lower class having been



long kept in besotted ignorance, there seemed to be no



force on which patriotism could take hold.















CHAPTER XXVII







AS ATTACH<E'> AND BEARER OF DESPATCHES



IN WAR-TIME--1855







The spring of 1855 was made interesting by the arrival



of the blockading fleet before the mouth of the



Neva, and shortly afterward I went down to look at it. 



It was a most imposing sight: long lines of mighty three-



deckers of the old pattern, British and French,--one



hundred in all,--stretched across the Gulf of Finland in front



of the fortresses of Cronstadt.  Behind the fortresses lay



the Russian fleet, helpless and abject; and yet, as events



showed during our own Civil War half a dozen years



later, a very slight degree of inventive ability would have



enabled the Russians to annihilate the hostile fleet, and to



gain the most prodigious naval victory of modern times. 



Had they simply taken one or two of their own great



ships to the Baird iron-works hard by, and plated them



with railway iron, of which there was plenty, they could



have paralleled the destruction of our old wooden frigates



at Norfolk by the Merrimac, but on a vastly greater



scale.  Yet this simple expedient occurred to no one; and



the allied fleet, under Sir Richard Dundas, bade defiance



to the Russian power during the whole summer.







The Russians looked more philosophically upon the



blockade than upon their reverses in the Crimea, but they



acted much like the small boy who takes revenge on the



big boy by making faces at him.  Some of their caricatures



on their enemies were very clever.  Fortunately for



such artistic efforts, the British had given them a fine



opportunity during the previous year, when Sir Charles



Napier, the commander of the Baltic fleet, having made



a boastful speech at a public dinner in London, and



invited his hearers to dine with him at St. Petersburg, had



returned to England, after a summer before Cronstadt,



without even a glimpse of the Russian capital.







I am the possessor of a very large collection of



historical caricatures of all nations, and among them all



there is hardly one more spirited and comical than that



which represents Sir Charles at the masthead of one of



his frigates, seeking, through a spy-glass, to get a sight at



the domes and spires of St. Petersburg: not even the best



efforts of Gillray or ``H. B.,'' or Gavarni or Daumier, or



the brightest things in ``Punch'' or ``Kladderadatsch''



surpass it.







Some other Russian efforts at keeping up public



spirit were less legitimate.  Popular pictures of a rude



sort were circulated in vast numbers among the peasants,



representing British and French soldiers desecrating



churches, plundering monasteries, and murdering priests.







Near the close of my stay I made a visit, in company



with Mr. Erving, first secretary of the legation, to



Moscow,--the journey, which now requires but twelve hours,



then consuming twenty-four; and a trying journey it was,



since there was no provision for sleeping.







The old Russian capital, and, above all, the Kremlin,



interested me greatly; but, of all the vast collections in



the Kremlin, two things especially arrested my attention. 



The first was a statue,--the only statue in all those vast



halls,--and there seemed a wondrous poetic justice in the



fact that it represented the first Napoleon.  The other



thing was an evidence of the feeling of the Emperor



Nicholas toward Poland.  In one of the large rooms was



a full-length portrait of Nicholas's elder brother and



immediate predecessor, Alexander I; flung on the floor at



his feet was the constitution of Poland, which he had



given, and which Nicholas, after fearful bloodshed, had



taken away; and lying near was the Polish scepter broken



in the middle.







A visit to the Sparrow Hills, from which Napoleon



first saw Moscow and the Kremlin, was also interesting;



but the city itself, though picturesque, disappointed me. 



Everywhere were filth, squalor, beggary, and fetishism. 



Evidences of official stupidity were many.  In one of the



Kremlin towers a catastrophe had occurred on the occasion



of the Emperor's funeral, a day or two before our



arrival: some thirty men had been ringing one of the



enormous bells, when it broke loose from its rotten



fastenings and crashed down into the midst of the ringers,



killing several.  Sad reminders of this slaughter were



shown us; it was clearly the result of gross neglect.







Another revelation of Russian officialism was there



vouchsafed us.  Wishing to send a very simple message



to our minister at St. Petersburg, we went to the



telegraph office and handed it to the clerk in charge. 



Putting on an air of great importance, he began a long



inquisitorial process, insisting on knowing our full names,



whence we had come, where we were going, how long we



were staying, why we were sending the message, etc., etc.;



and when he had evidently asked all the questions he



could think of, he gravely informed us that our message



could not be sent until the head of the office had given his



approval.  On our asking where the head of the office



was, he pointed out a stout gentleman in military uniform



seated near the stove in the further corner of the room,



reading a newspaper; and, on our requesting him to notify



this superior being, he answered that he could not thus



interrupt him; that we could see that he was busy.  At



this Erving lost his temper, caught up the paper, tore it



in pieces, threw them into the face of the underling with



a loud exclamation more vigorous than pious, and we



marched out defiantly.  Looking back when driving off



in our droshky, we saw that he had aroused the entire



establishment: at the door stood the whole personnel of the



office,--the military commander at the head,--all gazing



at us in a sort of stupefaction.  We expected to hear from



them afterward, but on reflection they evidently thought



it best not to stir the matter.







In reviewing this first of my sojourns in Russia, my



thoughts naturally dwell upon the two sovereigns Nicholas



I and Alexander II.  The first of these was a great



man scared out of greatness by the ever recurring specter



of the French Revolution.  There had been much to make



him a stern reactionary.  He could not but remember that



two Czars--his father and grandfather--had both been



murdered in obedience to family necessities.  At his



proclamation as emperor he had been welcomed by a revolt



which had forced him







   ``To wade through slaughter to a throne--''







a revolt which had deluged the great parade-ground of



St. Petersburg with the blood of his best soldiers, which



had sent many coffles of the nobility to Siberia, and which



had obliged him to see the bodies of several men who



might have made his reign illustrious dangling from the



fortress walls opposite the Winter Palace.  He had been



obliged to grapple with a fearful insurrection in Poland,



caused partly by the brutality of his satraps, but mainly



by religious hatreds; to suppress it with enormous carnage;



and to substitute, for the moderate constitutional



liberty which his brother had granted, a cruel despotism. 



He had thus become the fanatical apostle of reaction



throughout Europe, and as such was everywhere the



implacable enemy of any evolution of constitutional liberty. 



The despots of Europe adored him.  As symbols of his



ideals, he had given to the King of Prussia and to the



Neapolitan Bourbon copies of two of the statues which



adorned his Nevsky bridge--statues representing restive



horses restrained by strong men; and the Berlin populace,



with an unerring instinct, had given to one of these the



name ``Progress checked,'' and to the other the name



``Retrogression encouraged.''  To this day one sees every-



where in the palaces of Continental rulers, whether great



or petty, his columns of Siberian porphyry, jasper bowls,



or malachite vases--signs of his approval of reaction.







But, in justice to him, it should be said that there was



one crime he did not commit--a crime, indeed, which he



did not DARE commit: he did not violate his oath to



maintain the liberties of Finland.  THAT was reserved for the



second Nicholas, now on the Russian throne.







Whether at the great assemblages of the Winter Palace,



or at the reviews, or simply driving in his sledge or walking



in the street, he overawed all men by his presence.  Whenever



I saw him, and never more cogently than during that



last drive of his just before his death, there was forced



to my lips the thought:  ``You are the most majestic being



ever created.''  Colossal in stature; with a face such as



one finds on a Greek coin, but overcast with a shadow of



Muscovite melancholy; with a bearing dignified, but with



a manner not unkind, he bore himself like a god.  And



yet no man could be more simple or affable, whether in



his palace or in the street.  Those were the days when a



Russian Czar could drive or walk alone in every part of



every city in his empire.  He frequently took exercise in



walking along the Neva quay, and enjoyed talking with



any friends he met--especially with members of the



diplomatic corps.  The published letters of an American



minister--Mr. Dallas--give accounts of many discussions



thus held with him.







There seemed a most characteristic mingling of his better



and worse qualities in the two promises which, according



to tradition, he exacted on his death-bed from his son



--namely, that he would free the serfs, and that he would



never give a constitution to Poland.







The accession of this son, Alexander II, brought a



change at once: we all felt it.  While he had the big Romanoff



frame and beauty and dignity, he had less of the



majesty and none of the implacable sternness of his father. 



At the reception of the diplomatic corps on his accession



he showed this abundantly; for, despite the strong 



declarations in his speech, his tears betrayed him.  Reforms



began at once--halting, indeed, but all tending in the right



direction.  How they were developed, and how so largely



brought to naught, the world knows by heart.  Of all the



ghastly miscalculations ever made, of all the crimes which



have cost the earth most dear, his murder was the worst. 



The murders of William of Orange, of Lincoln, of Garfield,



of Carnot, of Humbert I, did not stop the course of



a beneficent evolution; but the murder of Alexander II



threw Russia back into the hands of a reaction worse than



any ever before known, which has now lasted nearly a



generation, and which bids fair to continue for many



more, unless the Russian reverses in the present war



force on a better order of things.  For me, looking



back upon those days, it is hard to imagine even the



craziest of nihilists or anarchists wild enough to commit



such a crime against so attractive a man fully embarked



on so blessed a career.  He, too, in the days of my stay,



was wont to mingle freely with his people; he even went



to their places of public amusement, and he was



frequently to be seen walking among them on the quays and



elsewhere.  In my reminiscences of the Hague Conference,



I give from the lips of Prince Munster an account of a



conversation under such circumstances: the Czar walking



on the quay or resting on a seat by the roadside, while



planning to right a wrong done by a petty Russian official



to a German student.  Therein appears not only a deep



sense of justice and humanity, but that melancholy, so



truly Russian, which was deepest in him and in his uncle,



the first Alexander.  There dwell also in my memory



certain photographs of him in his last days, shown me



not long before his death, during my first official stay at



Berlin.  His face was beautiful as of old, but the melancholy



had deepened, and the eyes made a fearful revelation;



for they were the eyes of a man who for years had



known himself to be hunted.  As I looked at them there



came back to me the remembrance of the great, beautiful



frightened eyes of a deer, hunted down and finally at my



mercy, in the midst of a lake in the Adirondacks--eyes



which haunted me long afterward.  And there comes back



the scene at the funeral ceremony in his honor at Berlin,



coincident with that at St. Petersburg--his uncle, the



Emperor William I, and all about him, in tears, and a



depth of real feeling shown such as no monarch of a



coarser fiber could have inspired.  When one reflects that



he had given his countrymen, among a great mass of



minor reforms, trial by jury; the emancipation of twenty



millions of serfs, with provision for homesteads; and had



at that moment--as his adviser, Loris Melikoff, confessed



when dying--a constitution ready for his people, one feels



inclined to curse those who take the methods of revolution



rather than those of evolution.







My departure from Russia embraces one or two incidents



which may throw some light upon the Russian



civilization of that period.  On account of the blockade, I



was obliged to take the post from St. Petersburg to Warsaw,



giving to the journey seven days and seven nights of



steady travel; and, as the pressure for places on the post



was very great, I was obliged to secure mine several weeks



beforehand, and then thought myself especially lucky in



obtaining a sort of sentry-box on the roof of the second



coach usually occupied by the guard.  This good luck was



due to the fact that, there being on that day two coaches,



one guard served for both; and the place on the second



was thus left vacant for me.







Day and night, then, during that whole week, we



rumbled on through the interminable forests of Poland, and



the distressingly dirty hamlets and towns scattered along



the road.  My first night out was trying, for it was very



cold; but, having secured from a dealer in the first



town where we stopped in the morning a large sheet of



felt, I wrapped my legs in it, and thenceforward was



comfortable.  My companions in the two post-coaches



were very lively, being mainly French actors and actresses



who had just finished their winter campaign in Russia;



and, when we changed horses at the post-houses, the scenes



were of a sort which an American orator once characterized



as ``halcyon and vociferous.''







Bearing a despatch-bag to our legation at Paris, I



carried the pass, not only of an attach<e'>, but of a bearer of



despatches, and on my departure our minister said to me:







``The Russian officials at the frontier have given much



trouble to Americans of late; and I hope that if they



trouble you, you will simply stop and inform me.  You



are traveling for pleasure and information, and a few days



more or less will make little difference.''  On arriving at



the frontier, I gave up my papers to the passport officials,



and was then approached by the officers of the custom-



house.  One of these, a tall personage in showy uniform,



was very solemn, and presently asked:  ``Are you



carrying out any specie?'' I answered:  ``None to speak



of; only about twenty or thirty German dollars.''  Said he: 



``That you must give up to me; the law of the empire does



not permit you to take out coin.''  ``No,'' I said; ``you



are mistaken.  I have already had the money changed,



and it is in German coin, not Russian.''  ``That makes no



difference,'' said he; ``you must give it up or stay here.'' 



My answer was that I would not give it up, and on this he



commanded his subordinates to take my baggage off the



coach.  My traveling companions now besought me to



make a quiet compromise with him, to give him half the



money, telling me that I might be detained there for weeks



or months, or even be maltreated; but I steadily refused,



and my baggage was removed.  All were ready to start



when the head of the police bureau came upon the scene



to return our papers.  His first proceeding was to call



out my name in a most obsequious tone, and, bowing



reverently, to tender me my passport.  I glanced at the



custom-house official, and saw that he turned pale.  The honor



done my little brief authority by the passport official



revealed to him his mistake, and he immediately ordered



his subordinates to replace my baggage on the coach; but



this I instantly forbade.  He then came up to me and



insisted that a misunderstanding had occurred.  ``No,'' I



said; ``there is no misunderstanding; you have only



treated me as you have treated other Americans.  The



American minister has ordered me to wait here and inform



him, and all that I have now to ask you is that you give



me the name of a hotel.''  At this be begged me to listen



to him, and presently was pleading most piteously; indeed,



he would have readily knelt and kissed my feet to secure



my forgiveness.  He became utterly abject.  All were



waiting, the coach stood open, the eyes of the whole party



were fastened upon us.  My comrades besought me to



let the rascal go; and at last, after a most earnest warning



to him, I gave my gracious permission to have the baggage



placed on the coach.  He was certainly at that moment



one of the happiest men I have ever seen; and, as we



drove off from the station, he lingered long, hat in hand,



profuse with bows and good wishes.







One other occurrence during those seven days and



nights of coaching may throw some light upon the feeling



which has recently produced, in that same region, the



Kishineff massacres.







One pleasant Saturday evening, at a Polish village, our



coach passed into the little green inclosure in front of



the post-house, and there stopped for a change of horses. 



While waiting, I noticed, from my sentry-box on the top



of the coach, several well-dressed people--by the cut of



their beards and hair, Jews--standing at some distance



outside the inclosure, and looking at us.  Presently two



of them--clearly, by their bearing and dress, men of



mark--entered the inclosure, came near the coach, and



stood quietly and respectfully.  In a few moments my



attention was attracted by a movement on the other side



of the coach: our coachman, a young serf, was skulking



rapidly toward the stables, and presently emerged with



his long horsewhip, skulked swiftly back again until he



came suddenly on these two grave and reverend men,



--each of them doubtless wealthy enough to have bought



a dozen like him,--began lashing them, and finally drove



them out of the inclosure like dogs, the assembled crowd



jeering and hooting after them.







Few evenings linger more pleasantly in my memory



than that on which I arrived in Breslau.  I was once more



outside of the Russian Empire; and, as I settled for the



evening before a kindly fire upon a cheerful hearth, there



rose under my windows, from a rollicking band of university



students, the ``Gaudeamus igitur.''  I seemed to have



arrived in another world--a world which held home and



friends.  Then, as never before, I realized the feeling



which the Marquis de Custine had revealed, to the amusement



of Europe and the disgust of the Emperor Nicholas,



nearly twenty years before.  The brilliant marquis, on his



way to St. Petersburg, had stopped at Stettin; and, on



his leaving the inn to take ship for Cronstadt next day, the



innkeeper said to him:  ``Well, you are going into a very



bad country.''  ``How so?'' said De Custine; ``when



did you travel there?''  ``Never,'' answered the inn-



keeper; ``but I have kept this inn for many years.  All



the leading Russians, going and coming by sea, have



stopped with me; and I have always noticed that those



coming from Russia are very glad, and those returning



very sad.''







Throughout the remainder of my journey across the



Continent, considerable attention was shown me at various



stopping-places, since travelers from within the Russian



lines at that time were rare indeed; but there was



nothing worthy of note until my arrival at Strasburg. 



There, in the railway station, I was presented by a young



Austrian nobleman to an American lady who was going



on to Paris accompanied by her son; and, as she was very



agreeable, I was glad when we all found ourselves together



in the same railway compartment.







Some time after leaving Strasburg she said to me:  ``I



don't think you caught my name at the station.''  To



this I frankly replied that I had not.  She then repeated it;



and I found her to be a distinguished leader in New York



and Parisian society, the wife of an American widely



known.  As we rolled on toward Paris, I became vaguely



aware that there was some trouble in our compartment;



but, being occupied with a book, I paid little attention to



the matter.  There were seven of us.  Facing each other at



one door were the American lady, whom I will call ``Mrs.



X.,'' and myself; at her left was her maid, then a vacant



seat, and then at the other door a German lady, richly



attired, evidently of high degree, and probably about fifty



years of age.  Facing this German lady sat an elegantly



dressed young man of about thirty, also of aristocratic



manners, and a German.  Between this gentleman and myself



sat the son of Mrs. X. and the Austrian gentleman



who had presented me to her.







Presently Mrs. X. bent over toward me and asked, in



an undertone, ``What do you think is the relationship



between those two people at the other door?''  I answered



that quite likely they were brother and sister.  ``No,'' said



she; ``they are man and wife.''  I answered, ``That can



hardly be; there is a difference of at least twenty years



in the young man's favor.''  ``Depend upon it,'' she



said, ``they are man and wife; it is a mariage de convenance;



she is dressed to look as young as possible.''  At



this I expressed new doubts, and the discussion dropped.







Presently the young German gentleman said something



to the lady opposite him which indicated that he



had lived in Berlin; whereupon Mrs. X. asked him,



diagonally across the car, if he had been at the Berlin



University.  At this he turned in some surprise and answered,



civilly but coldly, ``Yes, madam.''  Then he turned away



to converse with the lady who accompanied him.  Mrs. X.,



nothing daunted, persisted, and asked, ``Have you been



RECENTLY at the university?''  Before he could reply the



lady opposite him turned to Mrs. X. and said most



haughtily, ``Mon Dieu, madam, you must see that the gentleman



does not desire any conversation with you.  ``At this



Mrs. X.  became very humble, and rejoined most



penitently, ``Madam, I beg your pardon; if I had known that



the gentleman's mother did not wish him to talk with a



stranger, I would not have spoken to him.''  At this the



German lady started as if stung, turned very red, and



replied, ``Pardon, madam, I am not the mother of the



gentleman.''  At this the humble manner of Mrs. X. was



flung off in an instant, and turning fiercely upon the



German lady, she said, ``Madam, since you are not



the mother of the gentleman, and, of course, cannot be



his wife, by what right do you interfere to prevent his



answering me?''  The lady thus addressed started again



as if stabbed, turned pale, and gasped out, ``Pardon,



madam; I AM the wife of the gentleman.''  Instantly Mrs.



X. became again penitently apologetic, and answered,



``Madam, I beg a thousand pardons; I will not speak



again to the gentleman''; and then, turning to me, said



very solemnly, but loudly, so that all might hear,



``Heavens! can it be possible!''







By this time we were all in distress, the German lady



almost in a state of collapse, and her husband hardly less



so.  At various times during the remainder of the journey



I heard them affecting to laugh the matter off, but it was



clear that the thrust from my fair compatriot had cut deep



and would last long.







Arriving at our destination, I obtained the key to the



mystery.  On taking leave of Mrs. X., I said, ``That was



rather severe treatment which you administered to the



German lady.''  ``Yes,'' she answered; ``it will teach her



never again to go out of her way to insult an American



woman.''  She then told me that the lady had been



evidently vexed because Mrs. X. had brought her maid into



the compartment; and that this aristocratic dame had



shown her feeling by applying her handkerchief to her



nose, by sniffing, and by various other signs of disgust. 



``And then,'' said Mrs. X., ``I determined to teach her a



lesson.''







I never saw Mrs. X. again.  After a brilliant social



career of a few years she died; but her son, who was then a



boy of twelve years, in a short jacket, has since become



very prominent in Europe and America, and, in a way, influential.







In Paris I delivered my despatches to our minister, Mr.



Mason; was introduced to Baron Seebach, the Saxon min-



ister, Nesselrode's son-in-law, who was a leading personage



at the conference of the great powers then in



session; and saw various interesting men, among them



sundry young officers of the United States army, who



were on their way to the Crimea in order to observe the



warlike operations going on there, and one of them,



McClellan, also on his way to the head of our own army



in the Civil War which began a few years later.







It was the time of the first great French Exposition--



that of 1855.  The Emperor Napoleon III had opened it



with much pomp; and, though the whole affair was petty



compared with what we have known since, it attracted



visitors from the whole world, and among them came



Horace Greeley.







As he shuffled along the boulevards and streets of Paris,



in his mooning way, he attracted much wondering



attention, but was himself very unhappy because his



ignorance of the French language prevented his talking with



the people about him.







He had just gone through a singular experience, having,



the day before my arrival, been released from Clichy



prison, where he had been confined for debt.  Nothing



could be more comical than the whole business from first



to last.  A year or two previously there had taken place



in New York, on what has been since known as Reservoir



Square, an international exposition which, for its day,



was very creditable; but, this exposition having ended



in bankruptcy, a new board of commissioners had been



chosen, who, it was hoped, would secure public confidence,



and among these was Mr. Greeley.







Yet even under this new board the exposition had not



been a success; and it had been finally wound up in a very



unsatisfactory way, many people complaining that their



exhibits had not been returned to them--among these a



French sculptor of more ambition than repute, who had



sent a plaster cast of some sort of allegorical figure to



which he attributed an enormous value.  Having sought



in vain for redress in America, he returned to Europe and



there awaited the coming of some one of the directors;



and the first of these whom he caught was no less a person



than Greeley himself, who, soon after arriving in Paris,



was arrested for the debt and taken to Clichy prison.







Much feeling was shown by the American community. 



Every one knew that Mr. Greeley's connection with the



New York exposition was merely of a good-natured,



nominal sort.  It therefore became the fashion among



traveling Americans to visit him while thus in durance vile;



and among those who thus called upon him were two



former Presidents of the United States, both of whom



he had most bitterly opposed--Mr. Van Buren and Mr. Fillmore.







The American legation having made very earnest



representations, the prisoner was soon released; and the most



tangible result of the whole business was a letter, very



pithy and characteristic, which Greeley wrote to the ``New



York Tribune,'' giving this strange experience, and closing



with the words:  ``So ended my last chance to learn



French.''







A day or two after his release I met him at the student



restaurant of Madame Busque.  A large company of



Americans were present; and shortly after taking his seat



at table he tried to ask for some green string-beans,



which were then in season.  Addressing one of the serving-



maids, he said, ``Flawronce, donney moy--donney moy--



donney moy--''; and then, unable to remember the word,



he impatiently screamed out in a high treble, thrusting out



his plate at the same time, ``BEANS!''  The crowd of us



burst into laughter; whereupon Donn Piatt, then secretary



of the legation at Paris and afterward editor of the



``Capital'' at Washington, said:  ``Why, Greeley, you



don't improve a bit; you knew beans yesterday.''







This restaurant of Madame Busque's had been, for



some years, a place of resort for American students and



their traveling friends.  The few dishes served, though



simple, were good; all was plain; there were no table-



cloths; but the place was made attractive by the portraits



of various American artists and students who had frequented



the place in days gone by, and who had left these



adornments to the good old madame.







It was a simple cr<e'>merie in the Rue de la Michodi<e!>re,



a little way out of the Boulevard des Italiens; and its



success was due to the fact that Madame Busque, the kindest



old lady alive, had learned how to make sundry American



dishes, and had placed a sign in the window as follows: 



``Aux Am<e'>ricains.  Sp<e'>cialit<e'> de Pumpkin Pie et



de Buckwheat Cakes.''  Never was there a more jolly



restaurant.  One met there, not only students and artists,



but some of the most eminent men in American public



life.  The specialties as given on the sign-board were well



prepared; and many were the lamentations when the dear



old madame died, and the restaurant, being transferred



to another part of Paris, became pretentious and fell into



oblivion.







Another occurrence at the exposition dwells vividly in



my memory.  One day, in going through the annex in which



there was a show of domestic animals, I stopped for a moment



to look at a wonderful goat which was there tethered. 



He was very large, with a majestic head, spreading horns,



and long, white, curly beard.  Presently a party of French



gentlemen and ladies, evidently of the higher class, came



along and joined the crowd gazing at the animal.  In a



few moments one of the ladies, anxious to hurry on, said



to the large and dignified elderly gentleman at the head of



the party, ``Mais viens donc ''; to which he answered,



``Non, laisse moi le regarder; celui-l<a!> ressemble tant au



bon Dieu.''







This remark, which in Great Britain or the United States



would have aroused horror as blasphemy, was simply



answered by a peal of laughter, and the party passed on;



yet I could not but reflect on the fact that this attitude



toward the Supreme Being was possible after a fifteen



hundred years' monopoly of teaching by the church which



insists that to it alone should be intrusted the religious



instruction of the French people.







After staying a few weeks at the French capital, I left



for a short tour in Switzerland.  The only occurrence on



this journey possibly worthy of note was at the hospice



of the Great St. Bernard.  On a day early in September I



had walked over the T<e^>te Noire with two long-legged



Englishmen, and had so tired myself that the next morning



I was too late to catch the diligence from Martigny;



so that, on awaking toward noon, there was nothing left



for me but to walk, and I started on that rather toilsome



journey alone.  After plodding upward some miles along



the road toward the hospice, I was very weary indeed, but



felt that it would be dangerous to rest, since the banks of



snow on both sides of the road would be sure to give me



a deadly chill; and I therefore kept steadily on.  Presently



I overtook a small party, apparently English, also



going up the pass; and, at some distance in advance of



them, alone, a large woman with a very striking and even



masculine face.  I had certainly seen the face before, but



where I could not imagine.  Arriving finally at the hospice,



very tired, we were, after some waiting, invited out



to a good dinner by the two fathers deputed for the



purpose; and there, among the guests, I again saw the



lady, and was again puzzled to know where I had



previously seen her.  As the dinner went on the two monks



gave accounts of life at the hospice, rescues from



avalanches, and the like, and various questions were asked;



but the unknown lady sat perfectly still, uttering not a



word, until suddenly, just at the close of the dinner, she



put a question across the table to one of the fathers.  It



came almost like a peal of thunder-deep, strong, rolling



through the room, startling all of us, and fairly taking the



breath away from the good monk to whom it was addressed;



but he presently rallied, and in a rather faltering



tone made answer.  That was all.  But on this I at once



recognized her: it was Fanny Kemble Butler, whom, years



before, I had heard interpreting Shakspere.







Whether this episode had anything to do with it or not,



I soon found myself in rather a bad way.  The fatigues of



the two previous days had been too much for me.  I felt



very wretched, and presently one of the brothers came up



to me and asked whether I was ill.  I answered that I



was tired; whereupon he said kindly, ``Come with me.'' 



I went.  He took me to a neat, tidy little cell; put me into



bed as carefully as my grandmother had ever done; tucked



me in; brought me some weak, hot tea; and left me



with various kind injunctions.  Very early in the morning



I was aroused by the singing of the monks in the chapel,



but dozed on until eight or nine o'clock, when, feeling



entirely rested, I rose and, after breakfast, left the



monastery, with a party of newly made American friends, in as



good condition as ever, and with a very grateful feeling



toward my entertainers.  Against monks generally I must



confess to a prejudice; but the memory of these brothers



of St. Bernard I still cherish with a real affection.







Stopping at various interesting historic places, and



especially at Eisenach, whence I made the first of my many



visits to the Wartburg, I reached Berlin just before the



beginning of the university term, and there settled as a



student.  So, as I then supposed, ended my diplomatic



career forever.















CHAPTER XXVIII







AS COMMISSIONER TO SANTO DOMINGO--1871







Returning from Russia and Germany, I devoted



myself during thirteen years, first, to my professorial



duties at the University of Michigan; next, to political



duties in the State Senate at Albany; and, finally, to



organizing and administering Cornell University.  But in the



early winter of 1870-71 came an event which drew me out



of my university life for a time, and engaged me again in



diplomatic work.  While pursuing the even tenor of my



way, there came a telegraphic despatch from Mr. William



Orton, president of the Western Union Telegraph Company,



a devoted supporter of the administration, asking me



whether I had formed any definite opinion against the



annexation of the island of Santo Domingo to the United



States.  This question surprised me.  A proposal regarding



such an annexation had been for some time talked about. 



The newly elected President, General Grant, having been



besought by the authorities of that republic to propose



measures looking to annexation, had made a brief



examination; and Congress had passed a law authorizing the



appointment of three commissioners to visit the island, to



examine and report upon its desirability, from various



points of view, and to ascertain, as far as possible, the



feeling of its inhabitants; but I had given no attention



to the matter, and therefore answered Mr. Orton that I



had no opinion, one way or the other, regarding it.  A



day or two afterward came information that the President



had named the commission, and in the following order:  



Ex-Senator Benjamin F. Wade of Ohio, Andrew D.



White of New York, and Samuel G. Howe of Massachusetts. 



On receiving notice of my appointment, I went to



Washington, was at once admitted to an interview with the



President, and rarely have I been more happily disappointed. 



Instead of the taciturn man who, as his enemies



insisted, said nothing because he knew nothing, had



never cared for anything save military matters, and was



entirely absorbed in personal interests, I found a quiet,



dignified public officer, who presented the history of



the Santo Domingo question, and his view regarding it, in



a manner large, thoughtful, and statesmanlike.  There



was no special pleading; no attempt at converting me:



his whole effort seemed given to stating candidly the



history of the case thus far.







There was much need of such statement.  Mr. Charles



Sumner, the eminent senator from Massachusetts, had



completely broken with the President on this and other



questions; had attacked the policy of the administration



violently; had hinted at the supremacy of unworthy



motives; and had imputed rascality to men with whom the



President had close relations.  He appeared, also, as he



claimed, in the interest of the republic of Haiti, which



regarded with disfavor any acquisition by the United



States of territory on the island of which that quasi-



republic formed a part; and all his rhetoric and oratory



were brought to bear against the President's ideas.  I had



long been an admirer of Mr. Sumner, with the feeling



which a young man would naturally cherish toward an



older man of such high character who had given him



early recognition; and I now approached him with especial



gratitude and respect.  But I soon saw that his view of the



President was prejudiced, and his estimate of himself



abnormal.  Though a senator of such high standing and so



long in public affairs, he took himself almost too



seriously; and there had come a break between him, as



chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, and



President Grant's Secretary of State, Mr. Fish, who had



proved himself, as State senator, as Governor of New



York, as United States senator, and now as Secretary of



State, a man of the highest character and capacity.







The friends of the administration claimed that it had



become impossible for it to have any relations with Senator



Sumner; that he delayed, and indeed suppressed, treaties



of the greatest importance; that his egotism had become



so colossal that he practically assumed to himself



the entire conduct of foreign affairs; and the whole matter



reached a climax when, in a large social gathering, Mr.



Fish meeting Senator Sumner and extending his hand to



him, the latter deliberately rejected the courtesy and coldly



turned away.







Greatly admiring all these men, and deeply regretting



their divisions, which seemed sure to prove most injurious



to the Republican party and to the country, I wrote to



Mr. Gerrit Smith, urging him to come at once to Washington



and, as the lifelong friend of Senator Sumner and the



devoted supporter of General Grant, to use his great powers



in bringing them together.  He came and did his best;



but a few days afterward he said to me:  ``It is impossible;



it is a breach which can never be healed.''







Mr. Sumner's speeches I had always greatly admired,



and his plea for international peace, delivered before I



was fairly out of my boyhood, had made a deep



impression upon me.  Still greater was the effect of his



speeches against the extension of slavery.  It is true



that these speeches had little direct influence upon the



Senate; but they certainly had an immense effect upon



the country, and this effect was increased by the assault



upon him by Preston Brooks of South Carolina, which



nearly cost him his life, and from which he suffered



physically as long as he lived.  His influence was exercised



not only in the Senate, but in his own house.  In his



library he discussed, in a very interesting way, the main



questions of the time; and at his dinner-table one met



interesting men from all parts of the world.  At one of his



dinners I had an opportunity to observe one of the 



difficulties from which our country suffers most--namely, that



easy-going facility in slander which is certain to be



developed in the absence of any effective legal responsibility



for one's utterances.  At the time referred to there was



present an Englishman eminent in parliamentary and



business circles.  I sat next him, and near us sat a



gentleman who had held a subordinate position in the United



States navy, but who was out of employment, and apparently



for some reason which made him sore.  On being



asked by the Englishman why the famous American Collins



Line of transatlantic steamers had not succeeded, this



American burst into a tirade, declaring that it was all due



to the fact that the Collins company had been obliged to



waste its entire capital in bribing members of Congress



to obtain subsidies; that it had sunk all its funds in doing



this, and so had become bankrupt.  This I could not bear,



and indignantly interposed, stating the simple facts--



namely, that the ships of the company were built in the



most expensive manner, without any sufficient data as to



their chances of success; that the competition of the



Cunard company had been destructive to them; that, to cap



the climax, two out of their fleet of five had been, at an early



period in the history of the company, lost at sea; and I



expressed my complete disbelief in any cause of failure



like that which had been named.  As a matter of fact, the



Collins company, in their pride at the beauty of their



first ship, had sent it up the Potomac to Washington and



given a collation upon it to members of Congress; but



beyond this there was not the slightest evidence of anything



of the sort which the slanderer of his country had



brought forward.







As regards the Santo Domingo question, I must confess



that Mr. Sumner's speeches did not give me much light;



they seemed to me simply academic orations tinged by anger.







Far different was it with the speeches made on the same



side by Senator Carl Schurz.  In them was a restrained



strength of argument and a philosophic dealing with the



question which appealed both to reason and to patriotism. 



His argument as to the danger of extending the



domain of American institutions and the privileges of



American citizenship over regions like the West Indies



carried great weight with me; it was the calm, thoughtful



utterance of a man accustomed to look at large public



questions in the light of human history, and, while reasoning



upon them philosophically and eloquently, to observe



strict rules of logic.







I also had talks with various leading men at Washington



on the general subject.  Very interesting was an evening



passed with Admiral Porter of the navy, who had already



visited Santo Domingo, and who gave me valuable points



as to choosing routes and securing information.  Another



person with whom I had some conversation was Benjamin



Franklin Butler, previously a general in the Civil War,



and afterward governor of Massachusetts--a man of



amazing abilities, but with a certain recklessness in the use



of them which had brought him into nearly universal



discredit.  His ideas regarding the annexation of Santo



Domingo seemed to resolve themselves, after all, into a



feeling of utter indifference,--his main effort being to



secure positions for one or two of his friends as attach<e'>s



of the commission.







At various times I talked with the President on this and



other subjects, and was more and more impressed, not only



by his patriotism, but by his ability; and as I took leave



of him, he gave me one charge for which I shall always



revere his memory.







He said:  `` Your duties are, of course, imposed upon you



by Congress; I have no right as PRESIDENT to give you



instructions, but as a MAN I have a right in this matter.  You



have doubtless noticed hints in Congress, and charges in



various newspapers, that I am financially interested in the



acquisition of Santo Domingo.  Now, as a man, as your



fellow-citizen, I demand that on your arrival in the island,



you examine thoroughly into all American interests



there; that you study land titles and contracts with the



utmost care; and that if you find anything whatever which



connects me or any of my family with any of them, you



expose me to the American people.''  The President uttered



these words in a tone of deep earnestness.  I left him,



feeling that he was an honest man; and I may add that the



closest examination of men and documents relating to



titles and concessions in the island failed to reveal any



personal interest of his whatsoever.







Arriving next day in New York, I met the other commissioners,



with the secretaries, interpreters, attach<e'>s, and



various members of the press who were authorized to



accompany the expedition.  Most interesting of all to me



were the scientific experts.  It is a curious example of the



happy-go-lucky ways which prevail so frequently at Washington,



that although the resolutions of Congress required



the commissioners to examine into the mining and agricultural



capacities of the island, its meteorological characteristics,



its harbors and the possibilities of fortifying them,



its land tenures, and a multitude of other subjects



demanding the aid of experts, no provision was made for any



such aid, and the three commissioners and their secretaries,



not one of whom could be considered as entitled to hold



a decisive opinion on any of these subjects, were the only



persons expected to conduct the inquiry.  Seeing this, I



represented the matter to the President, and received his



permission to telegraph to presidents of several of our



leading universities asking them to secure for us active



young scientific men who would be willing to serve on the



expedition without salary.  The effort was successful. 



Having secured at the Smithsonian Institution two or



three good specialists in sundry fields, I obtained from



Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Cornell, and other universities



the right sort of men for various other lines of investigation,



and on the 17th of January, 1871, we all embarked



on the steam-frigate Tennessee, under the command of



Commodore Temple.







It fell to my lot to take a leading part in sending forth



our scientific experts into all parts of the republic.  



Fourteen different expeditions were thus organized and



despatched, and these made careful examinations and reports



which were wrought into the final report of the



commission.  It is doubtful whether any country was ever so



thoroughly examined in so short a time.  One party visited



various harbors with reference to their value for naval or



military purposes; another took as its subject the necessary



fortifications; another, agriculture; another, the coal



supply; another, the precious metals; another, the prevailing



epidemics and diseases of the country; while the commission



itself adjourned from place to place, taking testimony



on land tenures and on the general conditions and



disposition of the people.







I became much attached to my colleagues.  The first of



these, Senator Wade of Ohio, was bluff, direct, shrewd,



and well preserved, though over seventy years of age. 



He was a rough diamond, kindly in his judgments unless



his feeling of justice was injured; then he was implacable. 



Many sayings of his were current, among them a dry answer



to a senator from Texas who, having dwelt in high-



flown discourse on the superlative characteristics of the



State he represented, wound up all by saying, ``All that



Texas needs to make it a paradise is water and good society,''



to which Wade instantly replied, ``That 's all they



need in hell.''  The nimbleness and shrewdness of some



public men he failed to appreciate.  On his saying



something to me rather unfavorable to a noted statesman of



New England, I answered him, ``But, senator, he made an



admirable Speaker of the House of Representatives.''  To



which he answered, ``So would a squirrel if he could talk.''







Dr. Howe was a very different sort of man--a man of



the highest cultivation and of wide experience, who had



devoted his whole life to philanthropic efforts.  He had been



imprisoned in Spandau for attempting to aid the Poles;



had narrowly escaped with his life while struggling in



Greece against Turkey; and had braved death again and



again while aiding the free-State men against the pro-



slavery myrmidons of Kansas.  He told me that of all



these three experiences, he considered the last as by far



the most dangerous.  He had a high sense of personal



honor, and was devoted to what he considered the interests



of humanity.







Our main residence was at the city of Santo Domingo,



and our relations with the leading officials of the republic



were exceedingly pleasant.  The president, Baez, was a



man of force and ability, and, though a light mulatto, he



had none of the characteristics generally attributed in the



United States to men of mixed blood.  He had rather the



appearance of a swarthy Spaniard, and in all his conduct



he showed quiet self-reliance, independence, and the tone of



a high-spirited gentleman.  His family was noted in the history



of the island, and held large estates, near the capital



city, in the province of Azua.  He had gone through various



vicissitudes, at times conquering insurgents and at times



being driven out by them.  During a portion of his life he



had lived in Spain, and had there been made a marshal of



that kingdom.  There was a quiet elegance in his manners



and conversation which would have done credit to any



statesman in any country, and he had gathered about him



as his cabinet two or three really superior men who



appeared devoted to his fortunes.  I have never doubted that



his overtures to General Grant were patriotic.  As long as



he could remember, he had known nothing in his country



but a succession of sterile revolutions which had destroyed



all its prosperity and nearly all its population.  He took



very much to heart a passage in one of Mr. Sumner's



orations against the annexation project, in which the senator



had spoken of him as a man who wished to sell his country. 



Referring to this, President Baez said to me:  ``How could



I sell my country?  My property is here; my family is



here; my friends are here; all my interests are here:



how could I sell my country and run away and enjoy the



proceeds as Mr. Sumner thinks I wish to do?  Mr. Sumner



gives himself out to be the friend of the colored race; but



I also am a colored man,'' and with that Baez ran his hand



through his crisp hair and said, ``This leaves no doubt on



that point.''







We discussed at various times the condition of his



country and the relations which he desired to establish with



the United States, and I became more and more convinced



that his dominant motives were those of a patriot.  As a



matter of fact, the country under the prevailing system



was a ruin.  West of it was the republic of Haiti, more



than twice as populous, which from time to time



encroached upon its weaker sister.  In Santo Domingo itself



under one revolutionist after another, war had raged over



the entire territory of the republic year after year for



generations.  Traveling through the republic, it is a simple



fact that I never, in its entire domain, saw a bridge, a



plow, a spade, a shovel, or a hoe; the only implement we



saw was the machete--a heavy, rude instrument which



served as a sword in war and a spade in peace.  Everywhere



among the mountains I found magnificent squared



logs of the beautiful mahogany of the country left just



where the teams which had been drawing them had been



seized by revolutionists.







In one of the large interior towns there had been,



indeed, one evidence of civilization to which the people of



that region had pointed with pride--a steam-engine for



sawing timber; but sometime before my arrival one of



the innumerable petty revolutions had left it a mere mass



of rusty scraps.







Under the natural law of increase the population of the



republic should have been numbered in millions; but close



examination, in all parts of its territory, showed us that



there were not two hundred thousand inhabitants left, and



that of these about one half were mulattos, the other half



being about equally divided between blacks and whites.







Since my visit business men from the United States



have developed the country to some extent; but revolutions



have continued, each chieftain getting into place by



orating loudly about liberty, and then holding power by



murdering not only his enemies, but those whom he



thought likely to become his enemies.







The late president, Heureaux, was one of the most mon-



strous of these creatures who have found their breeding-



bed in Central American politics.  He seems to have



murdered, as far as possible, not only all who opposed him,



but all who, he thought, MIGHT oppose him, and even



members of their families.







It was not at all surprising that Baez, clear-sighted and



experienced as he was, saw an advantage to his country



in annexation to the United States.  He probably expected



that it would be, at first, a Territory of which he, as



the foremost man in the island, would become governor,



and that later it would come into the Union as a State



which he would be quite likely to represent in the United



States Senate.  At a later period, when I saw him in New



York, on his way to visit the President at Washington,



my favorable opinion of him was confirmed.  He was



quiet, dignified, manly, showing himself, in his conversation



and conduct, a self-respecting man of the world, accustomed



to manage large affairs and to deal with strong



men.







The same desire to annex the island to the United States



was evident among the clergy.  This at first surprised me,



for some of them were exceedingly fanatical, and one



of them, who was especially civil to us, had endeavored, a



few months before our arrival, to prevent the proper



burial of a charming American lady, the wife of the



American geologist of the government, under the old



Spanish view that, not being a Catholic, she should be



buried outside the cemetery upon the commons, like a dog. 



But the desire for peace and for a reasonable development



of the country, even under a government considered



heretical, was everywhere evident.







It became my duty to discuss the question of church



property with the papal nuncio and vicar apostolic.  He



was an archbishop who had been sent over to take temporary



charge of ecclesiastical matters; of course a most



earnest Roman Catholic, but thoroughly devoted to the



annexation of the island to the United States, and the



reason for his opinion was soon evident.  Throughout the



entire island one constantly sees great buildings and other



church property which have been confiscated and sold for



secular purposes.  In the city itself the opera-house was



a former church, which in its day had been very imposing,



and everywhere one saw monastery estates in private



hands.  The authorities in Santo Domingo had simply



pursued the policy so well known in various Latin countries,



and especially in France, Italy, and Spain, of allowing



the religious orders to absorb large masses of property,



and then squeezing it out of them into the coffers



of the state.







In view of this, I said to the papal nuncio that it was



very important for the United States, in considering the



question of annexing the island, to know what the church



claimed; that if the church demanded the restoration of



all that had been taken from her, this would certainly



greatly diminish the value of the island in the eyes of our



public men.  To this he answered that in case of annexation



the church would claim nothing whatever beyond



what it was absolutely and actually occupying and using



for its own purposes, and he offered to give me guarantees



to that effect which should be full and explicit.







It was perfectly clear that the church authorities



preferred to be under a government which, even though they



regarded it as Protestant, could secure them their property,



rather than to be subject to a Roman Catholic republic



in which they were liable to constantly recurring



spoliation.  This I found to be the spirit of the clergy of



every grade in all parts of the island: they had discovered



that under the Constitution of the United States confiscation



without compensation is impossible.







It also fell to my lot, as the youngest man in the



commission, to conduct an expedition across the mountains



from the city of Santo Domingo on the south coast to



Puerto Plata on the north.







During this journey, on which I was about ten days in



the saddle, it was my duty to confer with the principal



functionaries, and this gave me novel experiences.  When-



ever our cavalcade approached a town, we halted, a



messenger was sent forward, and soon the alcalde, the priests,



and other men of light and leading, with a long train of



functionaries, came dashing out on horseback to greet us;



introductions then took place, and, finally, there was a



wild gallop into the town to the house of the alcalde,



where speeches were made and compliments exchanged in



the high Spanish manner.







At the outset there was a mishap.  As we were organizing



our expedition, the gentlemen charged with purchasing



supplies assured me that if we wished to secure proper



consideration of the annexation question by the principal



men of the various towns, we must exercise a large if



simple hospitality, and that social gatherings without rum



punch would be offensive rather than propitiatory.  The



order to lay in a sufficient spirituous supply was reluctantly



given, and in due time we started, one of our train



of pack-horses having on each side of the saddle large



demijohns of the fluid which was to be so potent for



diplomatic purposes.  At the close of the first day's travel,



just as our hammocks had been swung, I heard a scream



and saw the people of our own and neighboring huts



snatching cups and glasses and running pell-mell toward



the point where our animals were tethered.  On examination



I found that the horse intrusted with the precious



burden, having been relieved of part of his load, had felt



warranted in disporting himself, and had finally rolled



over, crushing all the demijohns.  It seemed a serious



matter, but I cannot say that it afflicted me much; we



propitiated the local functionaries by other forms of



hospitality, and I never found that the absence of rum punch



seriously injured our diplomacy.







Civil war had been recently raging throughout the republic,



and in one of the interior towns I was one day notified



that a well-known guerrilla general, who had shown



great bravery in behalf of the Baez government, wished



a public interview.  The meeting took place in the large



room of the house which had been assigned me.  The



mountain chieftain entered, bearing a rifle, and, the first



salutations having been exchanged, he struck an oratorical



attitude, and after expressing, in a loud harangue, his



high consideration for the United States, for its representative,



and for all present, he solemnly tendered the rifle



to me, saying that he had taken it in battle from Luperon,



the arch-enemy of his country, and could think of no other



bestowal so worthy of it.  This gift somewhat disconcerted



me.  In the bitterness of party feeling at home regarding



the Santo Domingo question, how would it look



for one of the commissioners to accept such a present? 



President Grant had been held up to obloquy throughout



the whole length and breadth of the land for accepting a



dog; what, then, would happen to a diplomatic representative



who should accept a rifle?  Connected with the expedition



were some twenty or thirty representatives of the



press, and I could easily see how my acceptance of such



a gift would alarm the sensitive consciences of many of



them and be enlarged and embroidered until the United



States would resound with indignant outcry against a



commission which accepted presents and was probably won



over by contracts for artillery.  My first attempt was to



evade the difficulty.  Rifle in hand, I acknowledged my



appreciation of the gift, but declared to the general that my



keeping such a trophy would certainly be a wrong to his



family; that I would therefore accept it and transmit it



to his son, to be handed down from generation to generation



of his descendants as an heirloom and a monument



of bravery and patriotism.  I was just congratulating



myself on this bit of extemporized diplomacy, when a cloud



began to gather on the general's face, and presently he



broke forth, saying that he regretted to find his present



not good enough to be accepted; that it was the best he



had; that if he had possessed anything better he would



have brought it.  At this, two or three gentlemen in our



party pressed around me, and, in undertones, advised me



by all means to accept it.  There was no alternative; I



accepted the rifle in as sonorous words as I could muster



--``IN BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES'';



had it placed immediately in a large box with the words



``War Department'' upon it, in very staring letters; and



so the matter ended.  Fortunately the commission, though



attacked for a multitude of sins, escaped censure in this



matter.







One part of our duty was somewhat peculiar.  The



United States, a few years before, had been on the point



of concluding negotiations with Denmark for the purchase



of St. Thomas, when a volcanic disturbance threw an



American frigate in the harbor of that island upon the



shore, utterly wrecking both the vessel and the treaty. 



This experience it was which led to the insertion of a



clause in the Congressional instructions to the commission



requiring them to make examinations regarding the frequency



and severity of earthquakes.  This duty we discharged



faithfully, and on one occasion with a result



interesting both to students of history and of psychology. 



Arriving at the old town of Cotuy, among the mountains,



and returning the vicar's call, after my public reception, I



asked him the stereotyped question regarding earthquakes,



and was answered that about the year 1840 there had



been one of a very terrible sort; that it had shaken and



broken his great stone church very badly; that he had



repaired the whole structure, except the gaping crevice



above the front entrance; ``and,'' said the good old padre,



``THAT I left as a warning to my people, thinking that it



might have a good influence upon them.''  On visiting the



church, we found the crevice as the padre had described it;



but his reasoning was especially interesting, because it



corroborated the contention of Buckle, who, but a few



years before, in his ``History of Civilization in England,''



had stated that earthquakes and volcanoes had aided the



clergy of southern countries in maintaining superstition,



and who had afterward defended this view with great



wealth of learning when it was attacked by a writer in the



``Edinburgh Review.''  Certainly this Santo Domingo



example was on the side of the historian.







Another day brought us to Vega, noted as the point



where Columbus reared his standard above the wonderful



interior valley of the island; and there we were welcomed,



as usual, by the officials, and, among them, by a tall, ascetic-



looking priest who spoke French.  Returning his call next



day, I was shown into his presence in a room utterly bare



of all ornament save a large and beautiful photograph of



the Cathedral of Tours.  It had happened to me, just after



my college days, to travel on foot through a large part of



northern, western, and middle France, especially interesting



myself in cathedral architecture; and as my eye caught



this photograph I said, ``Father, what a beautiful picture



you have of the Church of St. Gatien!''  The countenance



of the priest, who had at first received me very ceremoniously



and coldly, was instantly changed; he looked at me



for a moment, and then threw his arms about me.  It was



pathetic: of all who had ever entered his door I was



probably the only one who had recognized the picture of



the cathedral where he had been ordained; and, above all,



by a curious inspiration which I cannot to this hour



account for, I had recognized it by the name of the saint to



whom it is dedicated.  Why I did not speak of it simply



as the Cathedral of Tours I know not; how I came to



remember that it was dedicated to St. Gatien I know not--



but this fact evidently loosened the cords of the father's



heart, and during my stay at Vega he was devoted to me;



giving me information of the greatest value regarding



the people, their habits, their diseases, and the like, much



of which, up to that moment, the commission and its



subordinates had vainly endeavored to secure.







And here I recall one thing which struck me as



significant.  This ascetic French priest was very severe in



condemnation of the old Spanish priesthood of the island. 



When I asked him regarding the morals of the people he



answered, ``How can you expect good morals in them



when their pastors set such bad examples?''  It was



evident that the church authorities at Rome were of his



opinion; for in nearly every town I found not only a



jolly, kindly, easy-going old Spanish padre, surrounded



by ``nephews'' and ``nieces,'' but a more austere ecclesiastic



recently arrived from France or Italy.







In the impressions made upon me by this long and



tedious journey across the island, pleasure and pain were



constantly mingled.  On one hand was the wonderful



beauty of the scenery, the luxuriance of the vegetation,



and the bracing warmth of the climate, while the United



States were going through a winter more than usually



bitter.







But, on the other hand, the whole condition of the



country seemed to indicate that the early Spanish rulers had



left a curse upon it from which it had never recovered. 



Its inhabitants, in revolution after revolution, had



destroyed all industry and industrial appliances, and had



virtually eaten up each other; generation after generation



had thus been almost entirely destroyed.







Finally, after nearly a fortnight of clambering over



mountains, pushing through tropical thickets, fording



streams, and negotiating in palm huts, we approached the



sea; and suddenly, on the north side of the island, at the



top of the mountain back of Puerto Plata, we looked far



down upon its beautiful harbor, in the midst of which,



like a fly upon a mirror, lay our trim little frigate



Nantasket.







The vice-president of the republic, surrounded by the



representatives of the city, having welcomed us with the



usual speeches, we pushed forward to the vice-presidential



villa, where I was to be lodged.







Having no other dress with me than my traveler's outfit,



of which the main features were a flaming red flannel



shirt, a poncho, and a sombrero, and having been invited



to dine that evening at the house of my host, with the



various consuls and other leaders of the place, I ordered



two of my men to hurry down the mountain, and out to



the frigate, to bring in my leather trunk containing a



costume more worthy of the expected ceremony; and



hardly were we comfortably established under the roof of



the vice-president, when two sailors came in, bringing the



precious burden.







Now came a catastrophe.  Turning the key, I noticed



that the brass fittings of the lock were covered with verdigris,



and, as the trunk opened, I shrank back in horror.  It



was filled, apparently, with a mass of mossy white-and-



green mold from which cockroaches of enormous size



darted in all directions.







Hastily pulling down the cover, I called a council of



war; the main personages in it being my private secretary,



Professor Crane, since acting president of Cornell



University, and sundry of the more important men in the



expedition.  To these I explained the situation.  It seemed



bad enough to lose all means of presenting a suitable



appearance at the approaching festivity, but this was



nothing compared with the idea that I had requited the



hospitality of my host by spreading through his house this



hideous entomological collection.







But as I exposed this latter feature of the situation, I



noticed a smile coming over the faces of my Dominican



attendants, and presently one of them remarked that the



cockroaches I had brought would find plenty of companions;



that the house was doubtless already full of them. 



This was a great relief to my conscience.  The trunk was



removed, and presently the clothing, in which I was to



be arrayed for the evening, was brought in.  It seemed in



a fearful condition, but, curiously enough, while boots,



shoes, and, above all, a package of white gloves carefully



reserved for grand ceremonies, had been nearly devoured,



the garments of various sorts had escaped fairly



well.







The next thing in order being the preparation of my



apparel for use, the men proceeded first to deluge it with



carbolic acid; and then, after drying it on the balconies



in front of the vice-president's house, to mitigate the



invincible carbolic odor by copious drenchings of Florida



water.  All day long they were thus at work making



ready for the evening ceremony.  In due time it arrived; 



and, finally, after a sumptuous entertainment, I



stood before the assembled consuls and other magnates. 



Probably no one of them remembers a word of my



discourse; but doubtless every survivor will agree that no



speaker, before or since, ever made to him an appeal of



such pungency.  I pervaded the whole atmosphere of the



place; indeed, the town itself seemed to me, as long as I



remained in it, to reek of that strange mixture of carbolic



acid and Florida water; and as soon as possible after



reaching the ship, the contents of the trunk were thrown



overboard, and life became less a burden.







Having been duly escorted to the Nantasket, and



received heartily by Commander McCook, I was assigned



his own cabin, but soon thought it expedient to get out of



it and sleep on deck.  The fact was that the companions



of my cockroaches had possession of the ship, and, to all



appearance, their headquarters were in the captain's



room.  I therefore ordered my bed on deck; and, though



it was February, passed two delightful nights in that



balmy atmosphere of the tropical seas while we skirted



the north side of the island until, at Port-au-Prince, I



rejoined the other commissioners, who had come in the



Tennessee along the southern coast.







At the Haitian capital our commission had interviews



with the president, his cabinet, and others, and afterward



we had time to look about us.  Few things could be more



dispiriting.  The city had been burned again and again, and



there had arisen a tangle of streets displaying every sort



of cheap absurdity in architecture.  The effects of the



recent revolution--the latest in a long series of civic



convulsions, cruel and sterile--were evident on all sides.  On



the slope above the city had stood the former residence of



the French governor: it had been a beautiful palace, and,



being so far from the sea, had, until the recent revolution,



escaped unharmed; but during that last effort a squad



of miscreants, howling the praises of liberty, having got



possession of a small armed vessel in the harbor and found



upon it a rifled cannon of long range, had exercised their



monkeyish passion for destruction by wantonly firing



upon this beautiful structure.  It now lay in ruins.  In its



main staircase an iron ring was pointed out to us, and we



were given the following chronicle.







During the recent revolution the fugitive President



Salnave had been captured, a leathern thong had been



rudely drawn through a gash in his hand, and, attached



by this to a cavalryman, he had been dragged up the hill



to the palace, through the crowd which had but recently



hurrahed for him, but which now jeered and pelted him. 



Arriving upon the scene of his former glory, he was



attached by the thong to this iron ring and shot.







Opposite the palace was the ruin of a mausoleum, and



in the street were scattered fragments of marble



sarcophagi beautifully sculptured: these had contained the



bodies of former rulers, but the revolutionists of Haiti,



imitating those of 1793 in France, as apes imitate men,



had torn the corpses out of them and had then scattered



these, with the fragments of their monuments, through the



streets.







In the markets of the city we had ample experience



of the advantage arising from unlimited paper money. 



Successive governments had kept themselves afloat by new



issues of currency, until its purchasing power was reduced



almost to nothing.  Preposterous sums were demanded for



the simplest articles: hundreds of dollars for a basket of



fruit, and thousands of dollars for a straw hat.







With us as one of our secretaries was Frederick



Douglass, the gifted son of an eminent Virginian and a slave



woman,--one of the two or three most talented men of color I



have ever known.  Up to this time he had cherished many



hopes that his race, if set free, would improve; but it was



evident that this experience in Santo Domingo discouraged



and depressed him.  He said to one of us, ``If this is



the outcome of self-government by my race, Heaven help us!''







Another curious example bearing on the same subject



was furnished us in Jamaica, whither we went after leav-



ing Haiti.  Our wish was to consult, on our way home, the



former president of the Haitian republic, Geffrard,--



who was then living in exile near Kingston.  We found



him in a beautiful apartment, elegantly furnished; and in



every way he seemed superior to the officials whom we



had met at Port-au-Prince.  He was a light mulatto,



intelligent, quiet, dignified, and able to state his views



without undue emphasis.  His wife was very agreeable, and



his daughter, though clearly of a melancholic temperament,



one of the most beautiful young women I have ever



seen.  The reason for her melancholy was evident to any



one who knew her father's history.  He had gone through



many political storms before he had fled from Haiti, and



in one of these his enemies had fired through the windows



of his house and killed his other daughter.







He calmly discussed with us the condition of the island,



and evidently believed that the only way to save it from



utter barbarism was to put it under the control of some



civilized power.







Interesting as were his opinions, he and his family, as



we saw them in their daily life, were still more so.  It



was a revelation to us all of what the colored race might



become in a land where it is under no social ban.  For



generations he and his had been the equals of the best



people they had met in France and in Haiti; they had



been guests at the dinners of ministers and at the soir<e'>es



of savants in the French capital; there was nothing about



them of that deprecatory sort which one sees so constantly



in men and women with African blood in their veins in



lands where their race has recently been held in servitude.







And here I may again cite the case of President Baez--



a man to whom it probably never occurred that he was not



the equal socially of the best men he met, and who in any



European country would be at once regarded as a man



of mark, and welcomed at any gathering of notables.







Among our excursions, while in Jamaica, was one to



Spanish Town, the residence of the British governor. 



In the drawing-room of His Excellency's wife there was



shown us one rather curious detail.  Not long before our



visit, the legislature had been abolished and the island



had been made a crown colony ruled by a royal governor



and council; therefore it was that, there being no further



use for it, the gorgeous chair of ``Mr. Speaker,'' a huge



construction apparently of carved oak, had been transferred



to her ladyship's drawing-room, and we were informed



that in this she received her guests.







From Kingston we came to Key West, and from that



point to Charleston, where, as our frigate was too large to



cross the bar, we were taken off, and thence reached



Washington by rail.







One detail regarding those latter days of our



commission is perhaps worthy of record as throwing light on a



seamy side of American life.  From first to last we had



shown every possible civility to the representatives of the



press who had accompanied us on the frigate, constantly



taking them with us in Santo Domingo and elsewhere,



and giving them every facility for collecting information. 



But from time to time things occurred which threw a new



and somewhat unpleasant light on the way misinformation



is liberally purveyed to the American public.  One day



one of these gentlemen, the representative of a leading



New York daily, talking with me of the sort of news his



paper required, said, ``The managers of our paper don't



care for serious information, such as particulars regarding



the country we visit, its inhabitants, etc., etc.; what they



want, above all, is something of a personal nature, such as



a quarrel or squabble, and when one occurs they expect us



to make the most of it.''







I thought no more of this until I arrived at Port-au-



Prince, where I found that this gentleman had suddenly



taken the mail-steamer for New York on the plea of urgent



business.  The real cause of his departure was soon



apparent.  His letters to the paper he served now began



to come back to us, and it was found that he had exercised



his imagination vigorously.  He had presented a



mass of sensational inventions, but his genius had been



especially exercised in trumping up quarrels which had



never taken place; his masterpiece being an account of a



bitter struggle between Senator Wade and myself.  As



a matter of fact, there had never been between us the



slightest ill-feeling; the old senator had been like a father



to me from first to last.







The same sort of thing was done by sundry other press



prostitutes, both during our stay in the West Indies and



at Washington; but I am happy to say that several of the



correspondents were men who took their duties seriously,



and really rendered a service to the American public by



giving information worth having.







Our journey from Charleston to Washington had one



episode perhaps worthy of recording, as showing a peculiarity



of local feeling at that time.  Through all the long



day we had little or nothing to eat, and looked forward



ravenously to the dinner on board the Potomac steamer. 



But on reaching it and entering the dining-room, we found



that our secretary, Mr. Frederick Douglass, was absolutely



refused admittance.  He, a man who had dined



with the foremost statesmen and scholars of our Northern



States and of Europe,--a man who by his dignity, ability,



and elegant manners was fit to honor any company,--was,



on account of his light tinge of African blood, not thought



fit to sit at meat with the motley crowd on a Potomac



steamer.  This being the case, Dr. Howe and myself



declined to dine, and so reached Washington, about



midnight, almost starving, thus experiencing, at a low price,



the pangs and glories of martyrdom.







One discovery made by the commission on its return



ought to be mentioned here, for the truth of history.  Mr.



Sumner, in his speeches before the Senate, had made a



strong point by contrasting the conduct of the United



States with that of Spain toward Santo Domingo.  He



had insisted that the conduct of Spain had been far more



honorable than that of the United States; that Spain had



brought no pressure to bear upon the Dominican republic;



that when Santo Domingo had accepted Spanish rule,



some years before, it had done so of its own free will; and



that ``not a single Spanish vessel was then in its waters,



nor a single Spanish sailor upon its soil.''  On the other



hand, he insisted that the conduct of the United States had



been the very opposite of this; that it had brought pressure



to bear upon the little island republic; and that when



the decision was made in favor of our country, there were



American ships off the coast and American soldiers upon



the island.  To prove this statement, he read from a speech



of the Spanish prime minister published in the official



paper of the Spanish government at Madrid.  To our



great surprise, we found, on arriving at the island, that



this statement was not correct; that when the action in



favor of annexation to Spain took place, Spanish ships



were upon the coast and Spanish soldiers upon the



island; and that there had been far more appearance



of pressure at that time than afterward, when the little



republic sought admission to the American Union.  One



of our first efforts, therefore, on returning, was to



find a copy of this official paper, for the purpose of



discovering how it was that the leader of the Spanish



ministry had uttered so grave an untruth.  The Spanish



newspaper was missing from the library of Congress;



but at last Dr. Howe, the third commissioner, a life-



long and deeply attached friend of Mr. Sumner, found it



in the library of the senator.  The passage which Mr.



Sumner had quoted was carefully marked; it was simply



to the effect that when the FIRST proceedings looking toward



annexation to Spain were initiated, there were no Spanish



ships in those waters, nor Spanish soldiers on shore.  This



was, however, equally true of the United States; for when



proceedings were begun in Santo Domingo looking to



annexation, there was not an American ship off the coast, nor



an American soldier on the island.







But the painful thing in the matter was that, had Mr



Sumner read the sentence immediately following that



which he quoted, it would have shown simply and distinctly



that his contention was unfounded; that, at the time



when the annexation proceedings WERE formally initiated



and accomplished, there were Spanish ships off those



shores and Spanish soldiers on the island.







I recall vividly the deep regret expressed at the time by



Dr. Howe that his friend Senator Sumner had been so



bitter in his opposition to the administration that he had



quoted the first part of the Spanish minister's speech and



suppressed the second part.  It was clear that if Mr. Sumner



had read the whole passage to the Senate it would have



shown that the conduct of the United States had not been



less magnanimous than that of Spain in the matter, and



that no argument whatever against the administration



could be founded upon its action in sending ships and



troops to the island.







In drawing up our report after our arrival, an amicable



difference of opinion showed itself.  Senator Wade, being



a ``manifest-destiny'' man, wished it expressly to recommend



annexation; Dr. Howe, in his anxiety to raise the



status of the colored race, took a similar view; but I



pointed out to them the fact that Congress had asked, not



for a recommendation, but for facts; that to give them



advice under such circumstances was to expose ourselves to a



snub, and could bring no good to any cause which any of



us might wish to serve; and I stated that if the general



report contained recommendations, I must be allowed to



present one simply containing facts.







The result was that we united in the document presented,



which is a simple statement of facts, and which, as



I believe, remains to this day the best general account of



the resources of Santo Domingo.







The result of our report was what I had expected.  The



Spanish part of that island is of great value from an



agricultural and probably from a mining point of view.  Its



valleys being swept by the trade-winds, its mountain slopes



offer to a white population summer retreats like those



afforded by similar situations to the British occupants of



India.  In winter it might also serve as a valuable



sanatorium.  I remember well the answer made to me by a man



from Maine, who had brought his family to the neighborhood



of Samana Bay in order to escape the rigors of the



New England winter.  On my asking him about the diseases



prevalent in his neighborhood, he said that his entire



household had gone through a light acclimating fever, but



he added:  ``We have all got through it without harm; and



on looking the whole matter over, I am persuaded that, if



you were to divide the people of any New England State



into two halves, leaving one half at home and sending the



other half here, there would in ten years be fewer deaths in



the half sent here, from all the diseases of this country,



than in the half left in New England, from consumption 



alone.''







A special element in the question of annexation was the



value of the harbor of Samana in controlling one of the



great passages from Europe to the Isthmus.  It is large



enough to hold any fleet, is protected by a mountain-range



from the northern winds, is easily fortified, and is the



natural outlet of the largest and most fertile valley in the



islands.  More than this, if the experiment of annexing an



outlying possession was to be tried, that was, perhaps, the



best of opportunities, since the resident population to be



assimilated was exceedingly small.







But the people of the United States, greatly as they



honored General Grant, and much as they respected his



recommendations, could not take his view.  They evidently



felt that, with the new duties imposed upon them



by the vast number of men recently set free and admitted



to suffrage in the South, they had quite enough to do



without assuming the responsibility of governing and



developing this new region peopled by blacks and mulattos;



and as a result of this very natural feeling the whole



proposal was dropped, and will doubtless remain in abeyance



until the experiments in dealing with Porto Rico



and the Philippines shall have shown the people of the



United States whether there is any place for such



dependencies under our system.















CHAPTER XXIX







AS COMMISSIONER TO THE PARIS EXPOSITION OF 1878







My next experience was of a quasi-diplomatic sort, in



connection with the Paris Exposition of 1878, and



it needs some preface.







During the Centennial Exposition of 1876 at Philadelphia,



I had been appointed upon the educational jury, and,



as the main part of the work came during the university



long vacation, had devoted myself to it, and had thus been



brought into relations with some very interesting men.







Of these may be named, at the outset, the Emperor Dom



Pedro of Brazil.  I first saw him in a somewhat curious



way.  He had landed at New York in the morning, and



early in the afternoon he appeared with the Empress and



their gentlemen and ladies in waiting at Booth's Theater. 



The attraction was Shakspere's ``Henry V,'' and no sooner



was he seated in his box than he had his Shakspere open



before him.  Being in an orchestra stall, I naturally



observed him from time to time, and at one passage light



was thrown upon his idea of his duties as a monarch.  The



play was given finely, by the best American company of



recent years, and he was deeply absorbed in it.  But



presently there came the words of King Henry--the noted



passage:







   ``And what have kings, that privates have not too,



     Save ceremony, save general ceremony?



     And what art thou, thou idol ceremony?''







Whereupon the Emperor and Empress, evidently moved



by the same impression, turned their heads from the stage,



looked significantly at each other, and his majesty very



earnestly nodded to his wife several times, as if



thoroughly assenting.







The feeling thus betrayed was undoubtedly sincere.  His



real love was for science, literature, and art; but above



all for science.  Some years before, at the founding of



Cornell University, Agassiz had shown me private letters



from him revealing his knowledge of natural history, and



the same thirst for knowledge which he showed then was



evident now.  From dawn till dusk he was hard at work,



visiting places of interest and asking questions which,



as various eminent authorities both in the United States



and France have since assured me, showed that he kept



himself well abreast of the most recent scientific



investigations.







On the following morning he invited me to call upon



him, and on my doing so, he saluted me with a multitude



of questions regarding our schools, colleges, and universities,



which I answered as best I could, though many of



them really merited more time than could be given during



a morning interview.  His manner was both impressive



and winning.  He had clearly thought much on educational



problems, and no man engaged in educational work could



fail to be stimulated by his questions and comments.  In



his manner there was nothing domineering or assuming. 



I saw him at various times afterward, and remember



especially his kindly and perfectly democratic manner at



a supper given by the late Mr. Drexel of Philadelphia,



when he came among us, moving from group to group,



recognizing here one old friend and there another, and



discussing with each some matter of value.







Republican as I am, it is clear to me that his



constitutional sovereignty was a government far more free,



liberal, and, indeed, republican, than the rule of the



demagogue despots who afterward drove him from his throne



ever has been or ever will be.







Another very interesting person was a Spanish officer,



Don Juan Marin, who has since held high commands both



in his own country and in the West Indies.  We were upon



the same jury, and I came to admire him much.  One day,



as we sat in our committee-room discussing various subjects



brought before us, there appeared in the street leading



to the main entrance of the grounds a large body



of soldiers with loud drumming and fifing.  On his asking



what troops these were, I answered that they were



the most noted of our American militia regiments--the



New York Seventh; and on his expressing a wish to see



them, we both walked out for that purpose.  Presently



the gates were thrown open, and in marched the regiment,



trim and brisk, bearing aloft the flag of the United



States and the standard of the State of New York.







At the moment when the standard and flag were abreast



of us, Colonel Marin, who was in civil dress, drew himself



up, removed his hat, and bowed low with simple dignity. 



The great crowd, including myself, were impressed by this



action.  It had never occurred to any one of the rest of us



to show such a tribute to the flag under which so many



good and true men had fought and died for us; and, as one



of the crowd very justly remarked afterward, ``The Spaniard



cheapened the whole lot of us.''  With a single exception,



it was the finest exhibition of manners I have ever



seen.[11]











[11] See the chapter on my attach<e'>ship in Russia.











Still another delegate was Professor Levasseur, of the



College of France and the French Institute.  His quickness



in ascertaining what was of value in a politico-economical



view, and his discussions of geographical matters,



interested and instructed all who had to do with him.







With him was R<e'>n<e'> Millet, an example of the most



attractive qualities of a serious Frenchman--qualities



which have since been recognized in his appointments as



minister and ambassador to Sweden and to Tunis.  Both



these gentlemen afterward made me visits at Cornell



which I greatly enjoyed.







At this time, too, I made a friendship which became



precious to me--that of Gardner Hubbard, one of the



best, truest, and most capable men, in whatever he undertook,



that I have ever seen.  The matter which interested



him then has since interested the world.  His son-in-law



Mr. Alexander Graham Bell, was exhibiting what appeared



to be a toy,--a toy which on one occasion he



showed to Dom Pedro and to others of us, and which



enabled us to hear in one of the buildings of the exposition a



violin played in another building.  It was regarded as



an interesting plaything, and nothing more.  A controlling



right in its use might have been bought for a very moderate



sum--yet it was the beginning of the telephone!







In connection with these and other interesting men, I



had devoted myself to the educational exhibits of the



exposition; and the result was that, during the following



year, I was appointed by the Governor of the State of



New York one of two honorary commissioners to the Paris



Exposition; the other being Mr. Morton, afterward Minister



to France, Vice-President of the United States, and



Governor of the State of New York.







I was not inclined, at first, to take my appointment very



seriously, but went to Paris simply to visit the exposition,



hoping that my honorary function would give me good



opportunities.  But on arriving I found the commissioner-



general of the United States, Governor McCormick, hard



pressed by his duties, and looking about for help.  A large



number of regular commissioners had been appointed, but



very few of them were of the slightest use.  Hardly one



of them could speak French, and very few of them really



took any interest in the duties assigned them.  The main



exception, a very noble one, was my old friend President



Barnard of Columbia College, and he had not yet arrived. 



Under these circumstances, I yielded to the earnest



request of Governor McCormick and threw myself heartily



into the work of making our part of the exposition a



success.







The American representation at the Vienna Exposition



a few years before had resulted in a scandal which had



resounded through Europe, and this scandal had arisen



from the fact that a subordinate, who had gained the



confidence of our excellent commissioner-general at that post,



had been charged, and to all appearance justly, with



receiving money for assigning privileges to bar-keepers



and caterers.  The result was that the commissioner-general



was cruelly wounded, and that finally he and his



associates were ignominiously removed, and the American



minister to Austria put in his place until a new commission



could be formed.  Of course every newspaper in Europe



hostile to republican ideas, and they were very many,



made the most of this catastrophe.  One of them in Vienna



was especially virulent; it called attention to the model



of an American school-house in the exposition, and said



that ``it should be carefully observed as part of the



machinery which trains up such mercenary wretches as have



recently disgraced humanity at the exposition.''







To avoid scandals, to negotiate with the French



commissioners on one side, and the crowd of exhibitors on



the other, and especially to see that in all particulars the



representatives of American industry were fully recognized,



was a matter of much difficulty; but happily all



turned out well.







Among the duties of my position was membership of the



upper jury--that which, in behalf of the French Republic,



awarded the highest prizes.  Each day, at about nine in



the morning, we met, and a remarkable body it was.  At



my right sat Meissonier, then the most eminent of French



painters, and beyond him Quintana, the Spanish poet.  Of



the former of these two I possess a curious memento.  He



was very assiduous in attendance at our sessions, and the



moment he took his seat he always began drawing, his



materials being the block of letter-paper and the pencils,



pens, and ink lying before him.  No matter what was



under discussion, he kept on with his drawing.  While



he listened, and even while he talked, his pencil or pen



continued moving over the paper.  He seemed to bring



every morning a mass of new impressions caught during



his walk to the exposition, which he made haste to trans-



fer to paper.  Sometimes he used a pencil, sometimes, a



quill pen, and not infrequently he would plunge the



feather end of the quill into his inkstand and rapidly put



into his work broader and blacker strokes.  As soon as



he had finished a drawing he generally tore it into bits



and threw them upon the floor, but occasionally he would



fold the sketches carefully and put them into his pocket. 



This being the case, no one dared ask him for one of them.







But one morning his paper gave out, and for lack of it



he took up a boxwood paper-knife lying near and began



work on it.  First he decorated the handle in a sort of



rococo way, and then dashed off on the blade, with his pen,



a very spirited head--a bourgeois physiognomy somewhat



in Gavarni's manner.  But as he could not tear the



paper-knife into bits, and did not care to take it away, he



left it upon the table.  This was my chance.  Immediately



after the session I asked the director-general to allow me



to carry it off as a souvenir; he assented heartily, and so



I possess a picture which I saw begun, continued, and



ended by one of the greatest of French painters.







At my left was Tresca, director of the French National



Conservatory of Arts and Trades; and next him, the



sphinx of the committee--the most silent man I ever saw



the rector of the Portuguese University of Coimbra.  During



the three months of our session no one of us ever



heard him utter a word.  Opposite was Jules Simon, eminent



as an orator, philosopher, scholar, and man of letters;



an academician who had held positions in various cabinets,



and had even been prime minister of the republic. 



On one side of him was Tullo Massarani, a senator of the



Italian kingdom, eminent as a writer on the philosophy of



art; on the other, Boussingault, one of the foremost chemists



of the century; and near him, Wischniegradsky, director



of the Imperial Technical Institute at Moscow, whom I



afterward came to know as minister of finance at St.



Petersburg.  Each afternoon we devoted to examining the



greater exhibits which were to come before us in competition



for the grands prix on the following morning.







At one of our sessions a curious difficulty arose.  The



committee on the award of these foremost prizes for



advanced work in electricity brought in their report, and, to



my amazement, made no award to my compatriot Edison,



who was then at the height of his reputation.  Presently



Tresca, who read the report, and who really lamented the



omission, whispered to me the reason of it.  Through the



negligence of persons representing Edison, no proper



exhibition of his inventions had been made to the committee. 



They had learned that his agent was employed in showing



the phonograph in a distant hall on the boulevards to



an audience who paid an admission fee; but, although they



had tried two or three times to have his apparatus shown



them, they had been unsuccessful, until at last, from a



feeling of what was due their own self-respect, they passed



the matter over entirely.  Of course my duty was to do



what was possible in rectifying this omission, and in as



good French as I could muster I made a speech in Edison's



behalf, describing his career, outlining his work,



and saying that I should really be ashamed to return to



America without some recognition of him and of his



inventions.  This was listened to most courteously, but my



success was insured by a remark of a less serious character,



which was that if Edison had not yet made a sufficient



number of inventions to entitle him to a grand prize,



he would certainly, at the rate he was going on, have done



so before the close of the exposition.  At this there was a



laugh, and my amendment was unanimously carried.







Many features in my work interested me, but one had



a melancholy tinge.  One afternoon, having been summoned



to pass upon certain competing works in sculpture,



we finally stood before the great bronze entrance-



doors of the Cathedral of Strasburg, which, having been



designed before the Franco-Prussian War, had but just



been finished.  They were very beautiful; but I could see



that my French associates felt deeply the changed situation



of affairs which this exhibit brought to their minds.







In order to promote the social relations which go for



so much at such times, I had taken the large apartment



temporarily relinquished by our American minister,



Governor Noyes of Ohio, in the Avenue Josephine; and there,



at my own table, brought together from time to time a



considerable number of noted men from various parts of



Europe.  Perhaps the most amusing occurrence during



the series of dinners I then gave was the meeting between



Story, the American sculptor at Rome, and Judge Brady



of New York.  For years each had been taken for the other,



in various parts of the world, but they had never met. 



In fact, so common was it for people to mistake one for



the other that both had, as a rule, ceased to explain the



mistake.  I was myself present with Story on one occasion



when a gentleman came up to him, saluted him as Judge



Brady, and asked him about their friends in New York: 



Story took no trouble to undeceive his interlocutor, but



remarked that, so far as he knew, they were all well, and



ended the interview with commonplaces.







These two Dromios evidently enjoyed meeting, and



nothing could be more amusing than their accounts of



various instances in which each had been mistaken for the



other.  Each had a rich vein of humor, and both presented



the details of these occurrences with especial zest.







Another American, of foreign birth, was not quite so



charming.  He was a man of value in his profession; but



his desire for promotion outran his discretion.  Having



served as juror at the Vienna Exposition, he had now



been appointed to a similar place in Paris; and after one



of my dinners he came up to a group in which there were



two or three members of the French cabinet, and said: 



``Mr. Vite, I vish you vould joost dell dese zhentlemen vat



I am doing vor Vrance.  I vas on de dasting gommittee



for vines und peers at Vien, and it 'most killed me; and



now I am here doing de same duty, and my stomach has



nearly gone pack on me.  Tell dese zhentlemen dat de



French Government zurely ought to gonfer ubon me de



Legion of Honor.''  This was spoken with the utmost



seriousness, and was embarrassing, since, of all subjects,



that which a French minister least wishes to discuss



publicly is the conferring of the red ribbon.







Embarrassing also was the jubilation of some of our



American exhibitors at our celebration of the Fourth of



July in the Bois de Boulogne.  Doubtless they were



excellent citizens, but never was there a better



exemplification of Dr. Arnold's saying that ``a traveller is a



self-constituted outlaw.''  A generous buffet had been



provided, after the French fashion, with a sufficiency of



viands and whatever wine was needed.  To my amazement,



these men, who at home were most of them, probably,



steady-going ``temperance men,'' were so overcome with



the idea that champagne was to be served ad libitum, that



the whole thing came near degenerating into an orgy.  A



European of the same rank, accustomed to drinking wine



moderately with his dinner, would have simply taken a



glass or two and thought no more of it; but these gentlemen



seemed to see in it the occasion of their lives.  Bottles



were seized and emptied, glass after glass, down the



throats of my impulsive fellow-citizens: in many cases



a bottle and more to a man.  Then came the worst of it. 



It had been arranged that speeches should be made under



a neighboring tent by leading members of the French



cabinet who had accepted invitations to address us.  But



when they proceeded to do this difficulties arose.  A number



of our compatriots, unduly exhilarated, and understanding



little that was said, first applauded on general



principles, but at the wrong places, and finally broke out



into apostrophes such as ``Speak English, old boy!'' 



``Talk Yankee fashion!''  ``Remember the glorious



Fourth!''  ``Give it to the British!''  ``Make the eagle



scream!'' and the like.  The result was that we were



obliged to make most earnest appeals to these gentlemen,



begging them not to disgrace our country; and, finally, the



proceedings were cut short.







Nor was this the end.  As I came down the Champs



<E'>lys<e'>es afterward, I met several groups of these



patriots, who showed by their walk and conversation that



they were decidedly the worse for their celebration of the



day; and the whole thing led me to reflect seriously on the



drink problem, and to ask whether our American solution



of it is the best.  I have been present at many large



festive assemblages, in various parts of Europe, where wine



was offered freely as a matter of course; but never have



I seen anything to approach this performance of my



countrymen.  I have been one of four thousand people at



the H<o^>tel de Ville in Paris on the occasion of a great



ball, at other entertainments almost as large in other



Continental countries, and at dinner parties innumerable



in every European country; but never, save in one



instance, were the festivities disturbed by any man on



account of drink.







The most eminent of American temperance advocates



during my young manhood, Mr. Delavan, insisted that he



found Italy, where all people, men, women, and children,



drink wine with their meals, if they can get it, the most



temperate country he had ever seen; and, having made



more than twelve different sojourns in Italy, I can confirm



that opinion.







So, too, again and again, when traveling in the old days



on the top of a diligence through village after village in



France, where the people were commemorating the patron



saint of their district, I have passed through crowds of



men, women, and children seated by the roadside drinking



wine, cider, and beer, and, so far as one could see, there



was no drunkenness; certainly none of the squalid, brutal,



swinish sort.  It may indeed be said that, in spite of light



stimulants, drunkenness has of late years increased in



France, especially among artisans and day laborers.  If



this be so, it comes to strengthen my view.  For the main



reason will doubtless be found in the increased prices of



light wines, due to vine diseases and the like, which have



driven the poorer classes to seek far more noxious beverages.







So, too, in Germany.  Like every resident in that



country, I have seen great crowds drinking much beer,



and, though I greatly dislike that sort of guzzling, I never



saw anything of the beastly, crazy, drunken exhibitions



which are so common on Independence Day and county-



fair day in many American towns where total abstinence is



loudly preached and ostensibly practised.  Least of all do



I admire the beer-swilling propensities of the German



students, and still I must confess that I have never seen



anything so wild, wicked, outrageous, and destructive to soul



and body as the drinking of distilled liquors at bars



which, in my student days, I saw among American students. 



But I make haste to say that within the last twenty



or thirty years American students have improved immensely



in this respect.  Athletics and greater interest in



study, caused by the substitution of the students' own



aims and tastes for the old cast-iron curriculum, are



doubtless the main reasons for this improvement.[12]











[12] Further reasons for this improvement I have endeavored to



give more in detail elsewhere.











Yet, in spite of this redeeming thing, the fact remains



that one of the greatest curses of American life is the



dram-drinking of distilled liquors at bars; and one key of



the whole misery is the American habit of ``treating,''--a



habit unknown in other countries.  For example, in America,



if Tom, Dick, and Harry happen to meet at a hotel,



or in the street, to discuss politics or business, Tom



invites Dick and Harry to drink with him, which, in



accordance with the code existing among large classes of



our fellow-citizens, Dick and Harry feel bound to do. 



After a little more talk Dick invites Harry and Tom to



drink; they feel obliged to accept; and finally Harry



invites Tom and Dick, with like result; so that these three



men have poured down their throats several glasses of



burning stimulants, perhaps in the morning, perhaps just



before the midday meal, or at some other especially



unsuitable time, with results more or less injurious to each



of them, physically and morally.







The European, more sensible, takes with his dinner,



as a rule, a glass or two of wine or beer, and is little, if



at all, the worse for it.  If he ever takes any distilled



liquor, he sips a very small glass of it after his dinner,



to aid digestion.







It is my earnest conviction, based upon wide observation



in my own country as well as in many others during



about half a century, that the American theory and practice



as regards the drink question are generally more



pernicious than those of any other civilized nation.  I



am not now speaking of TOTAL ABSTINENCE--of that, more



presently.  But the best TEMPERANCE workers among us



that I know are the men who brew light, pure beer, and



the vine-growers in California who raise and sell at a very



low price wines pleasant and salutary, if any wines can be so.







As to those who have no self-restraint, beer and wine,



like many other things, promote the ``survival of the



fittest,'' and are, like many other things, ``fool-killers,''



aiding to free the next generation from men of vicious



propensities and weak will.







I repeat it, the curse of American social life, among a



very considerable class of our people, is ``perpendicular



drinking''--that is, the pouring down of glass after glass



of distilled spirits, mostly adulterated, at all sorts of



inopportune times, and largely under the system of ``treating.''







The best cure for this, in my judgment, would be for



States to authorize and local authorities to adopt the



``Swedish system,'' which I found doing excellent service



at Gothenburg in Sweden a few years since, and



which I am sorry to see the fanatics there have recently



wrecked.  Under this plan the various towns allowed a



company to open a certain number of clean, tidy drinking-



places; obliged them to purchase pure liquors; forbade



them, under penalties, to sell to any man who had already



taken too much; made it also obligatory to sell something



to eat at the same time with something to drink; and, best



of all, restricted the profits of these establishments to a



moderate percentage,--seven or eight per cent., if I re-



member rightly,--all the surplus receipts going to public



purposes, and especially to local charities.  The main point



was that the men appointed to dispense the drinks had no



motive to sell adulterated drinks, or any more liquor than



was consistent with the sobriety of the customer.







I may add that, in my opinion, the worst enemies of real



temperance in America, as in other countries, have been



the thoughtless screamers against intemperance, who have



driven vast numbers of their fellow-citizens to drink in



secret or at bars.  Of course I shall have the honor of



being railed at and denounced by every fanatic who reads



these lines, but from my heart I believe them true.







I remember that some of these people bitterly attacked



Governor Stanford of California for the endowment of



Stanford University, in part, from the rent of his vineyards. 



People who had not a word to say against one



theological seminary for accepting the Daniel Drew



endowment, or against another for accepting the Jay Gould



endowment, were horrified that the Stanford University



should receive revenue from a vineyard.  The vineyards



of California, if their product were legally protected from



adulteration, could be made one of the most potent influences



against drunkenness that our country has seen.  The



California wines are practically the only pure wines



accessible to Americans.  They are so plentiful that there is



no motive to adulterate them, and their use among those



of us who are so unwise as to drink anything except water



ought to be effectively advocated as supplanting the



drinking of beer poisoned with strychnine, whisky poisoned



with fusel-oil, and ``French claret'' poisoned with



salicylic acid and aniline.







The true way to supplant the ``saloon'' and the barroom,



as regards working-men who obey their social instincts



by seeking something in the nature of a club, and



therefore resorting to places where stimulants are sold,



is to take the course so ably advocated by Bishop Potter:



namely, to furnish places of refreshment and amusement



which shall be free from all tendency to beastliness, and



which, with cheerful open fireplaces, games of various



sorts, good coffee and tea, and, if necessary, light beer



and wine, shall be more attractive than the ``saloons''



and ``dives'' which are doing our country such vast harm.







My advice to all men is to drink nothing but water. 



That is certainly the wisest way for nine men out of ten



--and probably for all ten.  Indeed, one reason why



the great body of our people accomplish so much more in



a given time than those of any other country, and why the



average American working-man ``catches on'' and ``gits



thar'' more certainly and quickly than a man of the same



sort in any other country (and careful comparison between



various other countries and our own has shown that



this is the case), is that a much larger proportion of our



people do not stupefy themselves with stimulants.







In what I have said above I have had in view the



problem as it really stands: namely, the existence of a very



large number of people who WILL have stimulants of



some kind.  In such cases common sense would seem to



dictate that, in the case of those who persist in using



distilled liquors, something ought to be done to substitute



those which are pure for those which are absolutely



poisonous and maddening; and, in the case of those who



merely seek a mild stimulant, to substitute for distilled



liquors light fermented beverages; and, in the case of



those who seek merely recreation after toil, to substitute



for beverages which contain alcohol, light beverages like



coffee, tea, and chocolate.







This is a long digression, but liberavi animam meam,



and now I return to my main subject.







The American commissioners were treated with great



kindness by the French authorities.  There were exceedingly



interesting receptions by various ministers, and at



these one met the men best worth knowing in France:



the men famous in science, literature, and art, who redeem



France from the disgrace heaped upon her by the wretched



creatures who most noisily represent her through sensational



newspapers.







Of the men who impressed me most was Henri Martin,



the eminent historian.  He discussed with me the history



of France in a way which aroused many new trains of



thought.  Jules Simon, eminent both as a scholar and a



statesman, did much for me.  On one occasion he took



me about Paris, showing me places of special interest



connected with the more striking scenes of the Revolutionary



period; on another, he went with me to the distribution of



prizes at the French Academy--a most striking scene;



and on still another he piloted me through his beautiful



library, pointing out various volumes in which were



embedded bullets which the communards had fired through



his windows from the roof of the Madeleine just opposite.







Another interesting experience was a breakfast with the



eminent chemist Sainte-Claire Deville, at which I met



Pasteur, who afterward took me through his laboratories,



where he was then making some of his most important



experiments.  In one part of his domain there were cages



containing dogs, and on my asking about them he said



that he was beginning a course of experiments bearing



on the causes and cure of hydrophobia.  Nothing could be



more simple and modest than this announcement of one



of the most fruitful investigations ever made.







Visits to various institutions of learning interested me



much, among these a second visit to the Agricultural



College at Grignon and the wonderful Conservatoire des Arts



et M<e'>tiers, which gave me new ideas for the similar



departments at Cornell, and a morning at the <E'>cole Normale,



where I saw altogether the best teaching of a Latin classic



that I have ever known.  As I heard Professor Desjardins



discussing with his class one of Cicero's letters in the



light of modern monuments in the Louvre and of recent



archaeological discoveries, I longed to be a boy again.







Among the statesmen whom I met at that time in France,



a strong impression was made upon me by one who had



played a leading part in the early days of Napoleon III,



but who was at this time living in retirement, M. Drouyn



de Lhuys.  He had won distinction as minister of foreign 



affairs, but, having retired from politics, had given



himself up in his old age to various good enterprises,



among these, to the great Reform School at Mettray. 



This he urged me to visit, and, although it was at a



considerable distance from Paris, I took his advice, and was



much interested in it.  The school seemed to me well



deserving thorough study by all especially interested in the



problem of crime in our own country.







There is in France a system under which, when any



young man is evidently going all wrong,--squandering his



patrimony and bringing his family into disgrace,--a family



council can be called, with power to place the wayward



youth under restraint; and here, in one part of the



Mettray establishment, were rooms in which such youths were



detained in accordance with the requests of family councils. 



It appeared that some had derived benefit from these



detentions, for there were shown me one or two letters



from them: one, indeed, written by a young man on the



bottom of a drawer, and intended for the eye of his successor



in the apartment, which was the most contrite yet



manly appeal I have ever read.







Another man of great eminence whom I met in those



days was Thiers.  I was taken by an old admirer of



his to his famous house in the Place St. Georges, and



there found him, in the midst of his devotees, receiving



homage.







He said but little, and that little was commonplace; but



I was not especially disappointed: my opinion of him was



made up long before, and time has but confirmed it.  The



more I have considered his doings as minister or



parliamentarian, and the more I have read his works, whether



his political pamphlet known as the ``History of the



French Revolution,'' which did so much to arouse sterile



civil struggles, or his ``History of the Consulate and of the



Empire,'' which did so much to revive the Napoleonic



legend, or his speeches under the constitutional monarchy



of Louis Philippe, under the Republic, and under the Second



Empire, which did so much to promote confusion and



anarchy, the less I admire him.  He seems to me eminently



an architect of ruin.







It is true that when France was wallowing in the misery



into which he and men like him had done so much to



plunge her, he exerted himself wonderfully to accomplish



her rescue; but when the history of that country during



the last century shall be fairly written, his career, brilliant



as it once appeared, will be admired by no thinking patriot.







I came to have far more respect for another statesman



whom I then met--Duruy, the eminent historian of



France and of Rome, who had labored so earnestly under



the Second Empire, both as a historian and a minister of



state, to develop a basis for rational liberty.







Seated next me at dinner, he made a remark which



threw much light on one of the most serious faults of the



French Republic.  Said he, ``Monsieur, I was minister of



public instruction under the Empire for seven years; since



my leaving that post six years have elapsed, and in that



time I have had seven successors.''







On another occasion he discoursed with me about the



special difficulties of France; and as I mentioned to him



that I remembered his controversy with Cardinal de



Bonnechose, in which the latter tried to drive him out of



office because he did not fetter scientific teaching in the



University of Paris, he spoke quite freely with me.  Although



not at all a radical, and evidently willing to act



in concert with the church as far as possible, he gave



me to understand that the demands made by ecclesiastics



upon every French ministry were absolutely unendurable;



that France never could yield to these demands; and that,



sooner or later, a great break must come between the



church and modern society.  His prophecy now seems



nearing fulfilment.







Among the various meetings which were held in



connection with the exposition was a convention of literary



men for the purpose of securing better international



arrangements regarding copyright.  Having been elected



a member of this, I had the satisfaction of hearing most



interesting speeches from Victor Hugo, Tourgueneff, and



Edmond About.  The latter made the best speech of all,



and by his exquisite wit and pleasing humor fully showed



his right to the name which his enemies had given him--



``the Voltaire of the nineteenth century.''







The proceedings of this convention closed with a banquet



over which Victor Hugo presided; and of all the trying



things in my life, perhaps the most so was the speech



which I then attempted in French, with Victor Hugo looking



at me.







There were also various educational congresses at the



Sorbonne, in which the discussions interested me much;



but sundry receptions at the French Academy were far



more attractive.  Of all the exquisite literary performances



I have ever known, the speeches made on those occasions



by M. Charles Blanc, M. Gaston Boissier, and the



members who received them were the most entertaining. 



To see these witty Frenchmen attacking each other in the



most pointed way, yet still observing all the forms of



politeness, and even covering their adversaries with



compliments, gives one new conceptions of human ingenuity. 



But whether it is calculated to increase respect for the



main actors is another question.







The formal closing of the exposition was a brilliant



pageant.  Various inventors and exhibitors received gifts



and decorations from the hand of the President of the



Republic, and, among them, Dr. Barnard, Story, and myself



were given officers' crosses of the Legion of Honor



which none of us has ever thought of wearing; but,



alas! my Swiss-American friend who had pleaded so



pathetically his heroic services in ``Dasting de vines und



peers'' for France did not receive even the chevalier's



ribbon, and the expression of his disappointment was loud



and long.







Nor was he the only disappointed visitor.  It was my



fortune one day at the American legation to observe one



difficulty which at the western capitals of Europe has



become very trying, and which may be mentioned to show



that an American representative has sometimes to meet. 



As I was sitting with our minister, Governor Noyes of



Ohio, there was shown into the room a lady, very stately,



and dressed in the height of fashion.  It was soon evident



that she was on the war-path.  She said, ``Mr.



Minister, I have come to ask you why it is that I do not



receive any invitations to balls and receptions given by



the cabinet ministers?''  Governor Noyes answered very



politely, ``Mrs. ----, we have placed your name on the list



of those whom we would especially like to have invited,



and have every hope that it will receive attention.''  She



answered, ``Why is it that you can do so much less than



your predecessor did at the last exposition?  THEN I



received a large number of invitations; NOW I receive none.'' 



The minister answered, ``I am very sorry indeed, madam;



but there are perhaps twenty or thirty thousand Americans



in Paris; the number of them invited on each occasion



cannot exceed fifty or sixty; and the French authorities



are just now giving preference to those who have come



from the United States to take some special part in the



exposition as commissioners or exhibitors.''  At this the



lady was very indignant.  She rose and said, ``I will give



you no more trouble, Mr. Minister; but I am going back



to America, and shall tell Senator Conkling, who gave



me my letter of introduction to you, that either he has



very little influence with you, or you have very little



influence with the French Government.  Good morning!'' 



And she flounced out of the room.







This is simply an indication of what is perhaps the



most vexatious plague which afflicts American representatives



in the leading European capitals,--a multitude of



people, more or less worthy, pressing to be presented at



court or to be invited to official functions.  The whole



matter has a ridiculous look, and has been used by sundry



demagogues as a text upon which to orate against



the diplomatic service and to arouse popular prejudice



against it.  But I think that a patriotic American may



well take the ground that while there is so much snobbery 



shown by a certain sort of Americans abroad, it is



not an unwise thing to have in each capital a man who



in the intervals of his more important duties, can keep this



struggling mass of folly from becoming a scandal and a



byword throughout Europe.  No one can know, until he



has seen the inner workings of our diplomatic service,



how much duty of this kind is quietly done by our



representatives, and how many things are thus avoided which



would tend to bring scorn upon our country and upon



republican institutions.















CHAPTER XXX







AS MINISTER TO GERMANY--1879-1881







In the spring of 1879 I was a third time brought into



the diplomatic service, and in a way which surprised me. 



The President of the United States at that period was Mr.



Hayes of Ohio.  I had met him once at Cornell University,



and had an interesting conversation with him, but never



any other communication, directly or indirectly.  Great,



then, was my astonishment when, upon the death of Bayard



Taylor just at the beginning of his career as minister



to Germany, there came to me an offer of the post thus



made vacant.







My first duty after accepting it was to visit Washington



and receive instructions.  Calling upon the Secretary



of State, Mr. Evarts, and finding his rooms filled with



people, I said:  ``Mr. Secretary, you are evidently very



busy; I can come at any other time you may name.'' 



Thereupon he answered:  ``Come in, come in; there are



just two rules at the State Department: one is that no



business is ever done out of office hours; and the other is, that



no business is ever done IN office hours.''  It was soon



evident that this was a phrase to put me at ease, rather



than an exact statement of fact; and, after my conference



with him, several days were given to familiarizing myself



with the correspondence of my immediate predecessors,



and with the views of the department on questions then



pending between the two countries.







Dining at the White House next day, I heard Mr. Evarts



withstand the President on a question which has always



interested me--the admission of cabinet ministers to



take part in the debates of Congress.  Mr. Hayes



presented the case in favor of their admission cogently; but



the Secretary of State overmatched his chief.  This



greatly pleased me; for I had been long convinced that



next to the power given the Supreme Court, the best



thing in the Constitution of the United States is that



complete separation of the executive from the legislative



power which prevents every Congressional session becoming



a perpetual gladiatorial combat or, say, rather,



a permanent game of foot-ball.  Again and again I have



heard European statesmen lament that their constitution-



makers had adopted, in this respect, the British rather



than the American system.  What it is in France, with



cabals organized to oust every new minister as soon as he



is appointed, and to provide for a ``new deal'' from the



first instant of an old one, with an average of one or two



changes of ministry every year as a result, we all know;



and, with the exception of the German parliament, Continental



legislatures generally are just about as bad; indeed,



in some respects the Italian parliament is worse. 



The British system would have certainly excluded such



admirable Secretaries of State as Thomas Jefferson and



Hamilton Fish; possibly such as John Quincy Adams,



Seward, and John Hay.  In Great Britain, having been



evolved in conformity with its environment, it is



successful; but it is successful nowhere else.  I have always



looked back with great complacency upon such men as



those above named in the State Department, and such as



Hamilton, Gallatin, Chase, Stanton, and Gage in other



departments, sitting quietly in their offices, giving calm



thought to government business, and allowing the heathen



to rage at their own sweet will in both houses of



Congress.  Under the other system, our Republic might



perhaps have become almost as delectable as Venezuela



with its hundred and four revolutions in seventy years[13]











[13] See Lord Lansdowne's speech, December, 1902.











On the day following I dined with the Secretary of



State, and found him in his usual pleasant mood.  Noting



on his dinner-service the words, ``Facta non verba,'' I



called his attention to them as a singular motto for an



eminent lawyer and orator; whereupon he said that, two



old members of Congress dining with him recently, one of



them asked the other what those words meant, to which



the reply was given, ``They mean, `Victuals, not talk.' ''







On the way to my post, I stopped in London and was



taken to various interesting places.  At the house of my



old friend and Yale classmate, George Washburn Smalley,



I met a number of very interesting people, and among



these was especially impressed by Mr. Meredith Townshend,



whose knowledge of American affairs seemed amazingly



extensive and preternaturally accurate.  At the



house of Sir William Harcourt I met Lord Ripon, about



that time Viceroy of India, whose views on dealings with



Orientals interested me much.  At the Royal Institution



an old acquaintance was renewed with Tyndall and Huxley;



and during an evening with the eminent painter, Mr.



Alma-Tadema, at his house in the suburbs, and especially



when returning from it, I made a very pleasant acquaintance



with the poet Browning.  As his carriage did not



arrive, I offered to take him home in mine; but hardly had



we started when we found ourselves in a dense fog, and



it shortly became evident that our driver had lost his



way.  As he wandered about for perhaps an hour, hoping



to find some indication of it, Browning's conversation was



very agreeable.  It ran at first on current questions, then



on travel, and finally on art,--all very simply and naturally,



with not a trace of posing or paradox.  Remembering



the obscurity of his verse, I was surprised at the



lucidity of his talk.  But at last, both of us becoming



somewhat anxious, we called a halt and questioned the



driver, who confessed that he had no idea where he was. 



As good, or ill, luck would have it, there just then emerged



from the fog an empty hansom-cab, and finding that its



driver knew more than ours, I engaged him as pilot, first



to Browning's house, and then to my own.







One old friend to whom I was especially indebted was



Sir Charles Reed, who had been my fellow-commissioner



at the Paris and Philadelphia expositions.  Thanks to



him, I was invited to the dinner of the lord mayor at the



Guildhall.  As we lingered in the library before going



to the table, opportunity was given to study various eminent



guests.  First came Cairns, the lord chancellor, in



all the glory of official robes and wig; then Lord Derby;



then Lord Salisbury, who, if I remember rightly, was



minister of foreign affairs; then, after several other



distinguished personages, most interesting of all, Lord



Beaconsfield, the prime minister.  He was the last to arrive,



and immediately after his coming he presented his arm to



the lady mayoress, and the procession took its way toward



the great hall.  From my seat, which was but a little



way from the high table, I had a good opportunity to



observe these men and to hear their speeches.







All was magnificent.  Nothing of its kind could be more



splendid than the massive gold and silver plate piled



upon the lord mayor's table and behind it, nothing more



sumptuous than the dinner, nothing more quaint than



the ceremonial.  Near the lord mayor, who was arrayed



in his robes, chain, and all the glories of his office, stood



the toastmaster, who announced the toasts in a manner



fit to make an American think himself dreaming,--something,



in fact, after this sort, in a queer singsong way,



with comical cadences, brought up at the end with a sharp



snap:  ``Me lawds, la-a-a-dies and gentleme-e-e-n, by



commawnd of the Right Honorable the Lawrd Marr, I



cha-a-awrge you fill your glawse-e-e-s and drink to the



health of the Right Honorable the Ur-r-rll of Beck'nsfield.''







A main feature of the ceremony was the loving-cup. 



Down each long table a large silver tankard containing



a pleasing beverage, of which the foundation seemed to



be claret, was passed; and, as it came, each of us in turn



arose, and, having received it solemnly from his neighbor,



who had drunk to his health, drank in return, and then,



turning to his next neighbor, drank to him; the latter



then received the cup, returned the compliment, and in the



same way passed it on.







During the whole entertainment I had frequently turned



my eyes toward the prime minister, and had been much



impressed by his apparent stolidity.  When he presented



his arm to the lady mayoress, when he walked with her, and



during all the time at table, he seemed much like a wooden



image galvanized into temporary life.  When he rose to



speak, there was the same wooden stiffness and he went



on in a kind of mechanical way until, suddenly, he darted



out a brilliant statement regarding the policy of the



government that aroused the whole audience; then, after more



of the same wooden manner and mechanical procedure,



another brilliant sentence; and so on to the end of the



speech.







All the speeches were good and to the point.  There



were none of those despairing efforts to pump up fun



which so frequently make American public dinners



distressing.  The speakers evidently bore in mind the fact



that on the following day their statements would be



pondered in the household of every well-to-do Englishman,



would be telegraphed to foreign nations, and would be



echoed back from friends and foes in all parts of the world.







After the regular speeches came a toast to the diplomatic



corps, and the person selected to respond was our



representative, the Honorable Edwards Pierpont.  This



he did exceedingly well, and in less than five minutes.



Sundry American papers had indulged in diatribes



against fulsome speeches at English banquets by some of



Mr. Pierpont's predecessors, and he had evidently



determined that no such charge should be established against



him.







Much was added to my pleasure by my neighbors at



the table--on one side, Sir Frederick Pollock, the eminent



father of the present Sir Frederick; and on the other,



Mr. Rolf, the ``remembrancer'' of the City of London.







This suggests the remark that, in my experience among



Englishmen, I have found very little of the coldness and



stiffness which are sometimes complained of.  On the



contrary, whenever I have been thrown among them, whether



in Great Britain or on the Continent, they have generally



proved to be agreeable conversationists.  One thing has



seemed to me at times curious and even comical: they will



frequently shut themselves up tightly from their



compatriots,--even from those of their own station,--and yet



be affable, and indeed expansive, to any American they



chance to meet.  The reason for this is, to an American,



even more curious than the fact.  I may discuss it later.







My arrival in Berlin took place just at the beginning of



the golden-wedding festivities of the old Emperor



William I.  There was a wonderful series of pageants: historic



costume balls, gala operas, and the like, at court;



but most memorable to me was the kindly welcome extended



to us by all in authority, from the Emperor and



Empress down.  The cordiality of the diplomatic corps



was also very pleasing, and during the presentations to



the ruling family of the empire I noticed one thing especially:



the great care with which they all, from the monarch



to the youngest prince, had prepared themselves to



begin a conversation agreeable to the new-comer.  One



of these high personages started a discussion with me upon



American shipping; another, on American art; another, on



scenery in Colorado; another, on our railways and steamers;



still another, on American dentists and dentistry;



and, in case of a lack of other subjects, there was Niagara,



which they could always fall back upon.







The duty of a prince of the house of Hohenzollern is



by no means light; it involves toil.  In my time, when



the present emperor, then the young Prince William,



brought his bride home, in addition to their other receptions



of public bodies, day after day and hour after hour,



they received the diplomatic corps, who were arranged



at the palace in a great circle, the ladies forming one half



and the gentlemen the other.  The young princess,



accompanied by her train, beginning with the ladies, and



the young prince, with his train, beginning with the gentlemen,



each walked slowly around the interior of the entire



circle, stopping at each foreign representative and



speaking to him, often in the language of his own country,



regarding some subject which might be supposed to



interest him.  It was really a surprising feat, for which, no



doubt, they had been carefully prepared, but which would



be found difficult even by many a well-trained scholar.







An American representative, in presenting his letter of



credence from the President of the United States to the



ruler of the German Empire, has one advantage in the fact



that he has an admirable topic ready to his hand, such as



perhaps no other minister has.  This boon was given us



by Frederick the Great.  He, among the first of Continental



rulers, recognized the American States as an independent



power; and therefore every American minister since,



including myself, has found it convenient, on presenting the



President's autograph letter to the King or Emperor, to



recall this event and to build upon it such an oratorical



edifice as circumstances may warrant.  The fact that the



great Frederick recognized the new American Republic,



not from love of it, but on account of his detestation of



England, provoked by her conduct during his desperate



struggle against his Continental enemies, is, of course,



on such occasions diplomatically kept in the background.







The great power in Germany at that time was the



chancellor, Prince Bismarck.  Nothing could be more



friendly and simple than his greeting; and however stately



his official entertainments to the diplomatic corps might



be, simplicity reigned at his family dinners, when his



conversation was apparently frank and certainly delightful.







To him I shall devote another chapter.







In those days an American minister at Berlin was



likely to find his personal relations with the German



minister of foreign affairs cordial, but his official



relations continuous war.  Hardly a day passed without some



skirmish regarding the rights of ``German-Americans''



in their Fatherland.  The old story constantly recurred



in new forms.  Generally it was sprung by some man who



had left Germany just at the age for entering the army,



had remained in America just long enough to secure



naturalization, and then, without a thought of discharging



any of his American duties, had come back to claim



exemption from his German duties, and to flaunt his



American citizen papers in the face of the authorities of the



province where he was born.  This was very galling



to these authorities, from the fact that such Americans



were often inclined to glory over their old schoolmates



and associates who had not taken this means of escaping



military duty; and it was no wonder that these brand-



new citizens, if their papers were not perfectly regular,



were sometimes held for desertion until the American



representative could intervene.







Still other cases were those where fines had been



imposed upon men of this class for non-appearance when



summoned to military duty, and an American minister



was expected to secure their remission.







In simple justice to Germany, it ought to be said that



there is no foreign matter of such importance so little



understood in the United States as this.  The average



American, looking on the surface of things, cannot see



why the young emigrant is not allowed to go and come as



he pleases.  The fact is that German policy in this



respect has been evolved in obedience to the instinct of



national self-preservation.  The German Empire, the



greatest Continental home of civilization, is an open camp,



perpetually besieged.  Speaking in a general way, it has



no natural frontiers of any sort--neither mountains nor



wide expanses of sea.  Eastward are one hundred and



thirty millions of people fanatically hostile as regards



race, religion, and imaginary interests; westward is



another great nation of forty millions, with a hatred on all



these points intensified by desire for revenge; northward



is a vigorous race estranged by old quarrels; and south



is a power which is largely hostile on racial, religious, and



historic grounds, and at best a very uncertain reliance. 



Under such circumstances, universal military service in



Germany is a condition of its existence, and evasion of



this is naturally looked upon as a sort of treason.  The



real wonder is that Germany has been so moderate in her



dealing with this question.  The yearly ``budgets of military



cases'' in the archives of the American Embassy bear



ample testimony to her desire to be just and even lenient.







To understand the position of Germany, let us suppose



that our Civil War had left our Union--as at one time



seemed likely--embracing merely a small number of Middle



States and covering a space about as large as Texas,



with a Confederacy on our southern boundary bitterly



hostile, another hostile nation extending from the west



bank of the Mississippi to the Rocky Mountains; a Pacific



confederation jealous and faultfinding; British dominions



to the northward vexed by commercial and personal



grievances; and New England a separate and doubtful



factor in the whole situation.  In that case we too would



have established a military system akin to that of Germany;



but whether we would have administered it as



reasonably as Germany has done is very doubtful.







Fortunately for the United States and for me, there was



in the ministry of foreign affairs, when I arrived, one of



the most admirable men I have ever known in such a



position:  Baron von B<u:>low.  He came of an illustrious



family, had great influence with the old Emperor William,



with Parliament, and in society; was independent, large



in his views, and sincerely devoted to maintaining the



best relations between his country and ours.  In cases such



as those just referred to he was very broad-minded; and



in one of the first which I had to present to him, when



I perhaps showed some nervousness, he said, ``Mr.



Minister, don't allow cases of this kind to vex you; I had



rather give the United States two hundred doubtful cases



every year than have the slightest ill-feeling arise between



us.''  This being the fact, it was comparatively easy to



deal with him.  Unfortunately, he died early during my



stay, and some of the ministers who succeeded him had



neither his independence nor his breadth of view.







It sometimes seemed to me, while doing duty at the



German capital in those days as minister, and at a more



recent period as ambassador, that I could not enter my



office without meeting some vexatious case.  One day it



was an American who, having thought that patriotism



required him, in a crowded railway carriage, roundly to



denounce Germany, the German people, and the imperial



government, had passed the night in a guard-house;



another day, it was one who, feeling called upon, in a



restaurant, to proclaim very loudly and grossly his



unfavorable opinion of the Emperor, had been arrested; on still



another occasion it was one of our fellow-citizens who,



having thought that he ought to be married in Berlin as



easily as in New York, had found himself entangled in a



network of regulations, prescriptions, and prohibitions.







Of this latter sort there were in my time several curious



cases.  One morning a man came rushing into the



legation in high excitement and exclaimed, ``Mr. Minister,



I am in the worst fix that any decent man was ever



in; I want you to help me out of it.''  And he then went



on with a bitter tirade against everybody and everything



in the German Empire.  When his wrath had effervesced



somewhat, he stated his case as follows:  ``Last year, while



traveling through Germany, I fell in love with a young



German lady, and after my return to America became



engaged to her.  I have now come for my bride; the wedding



is fixed for next Thursday; our steamer passages are



taken a day or two later; and I find that the authorities



will not allow me to marry unless I present a multitude



of papers such as I never dreamed of; some of them it



will take months to get, and some I can never get.  My



intended bride is in distress; her family evidently distrust



me; the wedding is postponed indefinitely; and my business



partner is cabling me to come back to America as



soon as possible.  I am asked for a baptismal certificate--



a Taufschein.  Now, so far as I know, I was never



baptized.  I am required to present a certificate showing the



consent of my parents to my marriage--I, a man thirty



years old and in a large business of my own!  I am asked



to give bonds for the payment of my debts in Germany.  I



owe no such debts; but I know no one who will give



such a bond.  I am notified that the banns must be



published a certain number of times before the wedding. 



What kind of a country is this, anyhow?''







We did the best we could.  In an interview with the



minister of public worship I was able to secure a



dispensation from the publishing of the banns; then a bond was



drawn up which I signed and thus settled the question



regarding possible debts in Germany.  As to the baptismal



certificate, I ordered inscribed, on the largest possible



sheet of official paper, the gentleman's affidavit that, in



the State of Ohio, where he was born, no Taufschein, or



baptismal certificate, was required at the time of his birth,



and to this was affixed the largest seal of the legation, with



plenty of wax.  The form of the affidavit may be judged



peculiar; but it was thought best not to startle the



authorities with the admission that the man had not been



baptized at all.  They could easily believe that a State like



Ohio, which some of them doubtless regarded as still in



the backwoods and mainly tenanted by the aborigines,



might have omitted, in days gone by, to require a Taufschein;



but that an unbaptized Christian should offer himself



to be married in Germany would perhaps have so



paralyzed their powers of belief that permission for the



marriage could never have been secured.







In this and various other ways we overcame the



difficulties, and, though the wedding did not take place upon



the appointed day, and the return to America had to be



deferred, the couple, at last, after marriage first before



the public authorities, and then in church, were able to



depart in peace.







Another case was typical.  One morning a gentleman



came into the legation in the greatest distress; and I soon



learned that this, too, was a marriage case--but very



different from the other.  This gentleman, a naturalized



German-American in excellent standing, had come over



to claim his bride.  He had gone through all the 



formalities perfectly, and, as his business permitted it, had



decided to reside a year abroad in order that he might take



the furniture of his apartment back to America free of



duty.  This apartment, a large and beautiful suite of



rooms, he had already rented, had furnished it very fully,



and then, for the few days intervening before his marriage,



had put it under care of his married sister.  But, alas! this



sister's husband was a bankrupt, and hardly had she taken



charge of the apartment when the furniture was seized by



her husband's creditors, seals placed upon its doors by



the authorities, ``and,'' said the man, in his distress,



``unless you do something it will take two years to reach the



case on the calendar; meantime I must pay the rent of the



apartment and lose the entire use of it as well as of the



furniture.''  ``But,'' said I, ``what can be done?''  He



answered, ``My lawyer says that if you will ask it as a



favor from the judge, he will grant an order bringing the



case up immediately.''  To this I naturally replied that



I could hardly interfere with a judge in any case before



him; but his answer was pithy.  Said he, ``You are the



American minister, and if you are not here to get Americans



out of scrapes, I should like to know what you ARE



here for.''  This was unanswerable, and in the afternoon



I drove in state to the judge, left an official card upon him,



and then wrote, stating the case carefully, and saying that,



while I could not think of interfering in any case before



him, still, that as this matter appeared to me one of especial



hardship, if it could be reached at once the ends of justice



would undoubtedly be furthered thereby.  That my



application was successful was shown by the fact that the



man thus rescued never returned to thank his benefactor.







A more important part of a minister's duty is in



connection with the commercial relations between the two



nations.  Each country was attempting, by means of its



tariffs, to get all the advantage possible, and there resulted



various German regulations bearing heavily on some



American products.  This started questions which had to



be met with especial care, requiring many interviews with



the foreign office and with various members of the



imperial cabinet.







In looking after commercial relations, a general



oversight of the consuls throughout the empire was no small



part of the minister's duty.  The consular body was good



--remarkably good when one considers the radically



vicious policy which prevails in the selection and retention



of its members.  But the more I saw of it, the stronger



became my conviction that the first thing needed is that,



when our government secures a thoroughly good man in



a consular position, it should keep him there; and, moreover,



that it should establish a full system of promotions



for merit.  Under the present system the rule is that, as



soon as a man is fit for the duties, he is rotated out of office



and supplanted by a man who has all his duties to learn. 



I am glad to say that of late years there have been many



excellent exceptions to this rule; and one of my most



earnest hopes, as a man loving my country and desirous of its



high standing abroad, is that, more and more, the tendency,



both as regards the consular and diplomatic service,



may be in the direction of sending men carefully fitted for



positions, and of retaining them without regard to changes



in the home administration.







Still another part of the minister's duty was the careful



collection of facts regarding important subjects, and the



transmission of them to the State department.  These were



embodied in despatches.  Such subjects as railway



management, the organization and administration of city



governments, the growth of various industries, the creation



of new schools of instruction, the development of public



libraries, and the like, as well as a multitude of other



practical matters, were thus dwelt upon.







It was also a duty of the minister to keep a general



oversight of the interests of Americans within his



jurisdiction.  There are always a certain number of Americans



in distress,--real, pretended, or imaginary,--and these



must be looked after; then there are American statesmen



seeking introductions or information, American scholars



in quest of similar things in a different field, American



merchants and manufacturers seeking access to men and



establishments which will enable them to build up their



own interests and those of their country, and, most



interesting of all, American students at the university and



other advanced schools in Berlin and throughout



Germany.  To advise with these and note their progress



formed a most pleasing relief from strictly official matters.







Least pleasing of all duties was looking after fugitives



from justice or birds of prey evidently seeking new



victims.  On this latter point, I recall an experience which



may throw some light on the German mode of watching



doubtful persons.  A young American had appeared in



various public places wearing a naval uniform to which



he was not entitled, declaring himself a son of the President



of the United States, and apparently making ready



for a career of scoundrelism.  Consulting the minister of



foreign affairs one day, I mentioned this case, asking him



to give me such information as came to him.  He



answered, ``Remind me at your next visit, and perhaps I



can show you something.''  On my calling some days later,



the minister handed me a paper on which was inscribed



apparently not only every place the young man had



visited, but virtually everything he had done and said during



the past week, his conversations in the restaurants being



noted with especial care; and while the man was evidently



worthless, he was clearly rather a fool than a



scoundrel.  On my expressing surprise at the fullness of



this information, the minister seemed quite as much



surprised at my supposing it possible for any good



government to exist without such complete surveillance of



suspected persons.







Another curious matter which then came up was the



selling of sham diplomas by a pretended American university. 



This was brought to my notice in sundry letters, and



finally by calls from one or two young Germans who were



considering the advisability of buying a doctorate from a



man named Buchanan, who claimed to be president of the



``University of Philadelphia.''  Although I demonstrated



to them the worthlessness of such sham degrees of a non-



existent institution, they evidently thought that to obtain



one would aid them in their professions, and were inclined



to make a purchase.  From time to time there were slurs



in the German papers upon all American institutions of



learning, based upon advertisements of such diplomas;



and finally my patriotic wrath was brought to a climax



by a comedy at the Royal Theater, in which the rascal of



the piece, having gone through a long career of scoundrelism,



finally secures a diploma from the ``University



of PENNSYLVANIA''!







In view of this, I wrote not only despatches to the Secretary



of State, but private letters to leading citizens of



Philadelphia, calling their attention to the subject, and



especially to the injury that this kind of thing was doing



to the University of Pennsylvania, an institution of which



every Philadelphian, and indeed every American, has a



right to be proud.  As a result, the whole thing was broken



up, and, though it has been occasionally revived, it has not



again inflicted such a stigma upon American education.







But perhaps the most annoying business of all arose



from presentations at court.  The mania of many of our



fellow-citizens for mingling with birds of the finest feather



has passed into a European proverb which is unjust to the



great body of Americans; but at present there seems to



be no help for it, the reputation of the many suffering for



the bad taste of the few.  Nothing could exceed the



pertinacity shown in some cases.  Different rules prevail at



different courts, and at the imperial court of Germany



the rule for some years has been that persons eminent



in those walks of life that are especially honored will



always be welcome, and that the proper authority, on being



notified of their presence, will extend such invitations



as may seem warranted.  Unfortunately, while some of



the most worthy visitors did not make themselves known,



some persons far less desirable took too much pains to



attract notice.  A satirist would find rich material in the



archives of our embassies and legations abroad.  I have



found nowhere more elements of true comedy and even



broad farce than in some of the correspondence on this



subject there embalmed.







But while this class of applicants is mainly made up of



women, fairness compels me to say that there is a similar



class of men.  These are persons possessed of an insatiate



and at times almost insane desire to be able, on their



return, to say that they have talked with a crowned head.







Should the sovereign see one in ten of the persons from



foreign nations who thus seek him, he would have no time



for anything else.  He therefore insists, like any private



person in any country, on his right not to give his time to



those who have no real claim upon him, and some very



good fellow-citizens of ours have seemed almost inclined



to make this feeling of his Majesty a casus belli.







On the other hand there are large numbers of Americans



making demands, and often very serious demands, of time



and labor on their diplomatic representative which it is



an honor and pleasure to render.  Of these are such as,



having gained a right to do so by excellent work in their



respective fields at home, come abroad, as legislators



or educators or scientific investigators or engineers or



scholars or managers of worthy business enterprises, to



extend their knowledge for the benefit of their country. 



No work has been more satisfactory to my conscience than



the aid which I have been able to render to men and women



of this sort.







Still, one has to make discriminations.  I remember



especially a very charming young lady of, say, sixteen



summers, who came to me saying that she had agreed to write



some letters for a Western newspaper, and that she wished



to visit all the leading prisons, reformatory institutions,



and asylums of Germany.  I looked into her pretty face,



and soon showed her that the German Government would



never think of allowing a young lady like herself to



inspect such places as those she had named, and that in my



opinion they were quite right; but I suggested a series



of letters on a multitude of things which would certainly



prove interesting and instructive, and which she might



easily study in all parts of Germany.  She took my advice,



wrote many such letters, and the selection which she



published proved to be delightful.







But at times zeal for improvements at home goes



perilously far toward turning the activity of an ambassador



or minister from its proper channels.  Scores of people



write regarding schools for their children, instructors in



music, cheap boarding-houses, and I have had an excellent



fellow-citizen ask me to send him a peck of turnips. 



But if the applications are really from worthy persons,



they can generally be dealt with in ways which require no



especial labor--many of them through our consuls, to



whom they more properly belong.







Those who really ask too much, insisting that the



embassy shall look after their private business, may be



reminded that the rules of the diplomatic service forbid



such investigations, in behalf of individuals, without



previous instructions from the State Department.







Of the lesser troublesome people may be named, first,



those who are looking up their genealogies.  A typical



letter made up from various epistles, as a ``composite''



portrait is made out of different photographs, would run



much as follows:











SIR:  I have reason to suppose that I am descended from an



old noble family in Germany.  My grandfather's name was Max



Schulze.  He came, I think, from some part of Austria or Bavaria



or Schleswig-Holstein.  Please trace back my ancestry and let me



know the result at your earliest convenience.



                       Yours truly,



                            MARY SMITH.











Another more troublesome class is that of people seeking



inheritances.  A typical letter, compounded as above,



would run somewhat as follows:











SIR: I am assured that a fortune of several millions of marks



left by one John M<u:>ller, who died in some part of Germany two



or three centuries ago, is held at the imperial treasury awaiting



heirs.  My grandmother's name was Miller.  Please look the



matter up and inform me as to my rights.



                       Yours truly,



                            JOHN MYERS.











P.S.  If you succeed in getting the money, I will be glad to pay



you handsomely for your services.











Such letters as this are easily answered.  During this



first sojourn of mine at Berlin as minister, I caused a



circular, going over the whole ground, to be carefully



prepared and to be forwarded to applicants.  In this occur



the following words:  ``We have yearly, from various parts



of the United States, a large number of applications for



information or aid regarding great estates in Germany



supposed to be awaiting heirs.  They are all more or less



indefinite, many sad, and some ludicrous. . . .  There are



in Germany no large estates, awaiting distribution to



unknown heirs, in the hands of the government or of anybody,



and all efforts to discover such estates that the legation



has ever made or heard of have proved fruitless.''







Among the many odd applications received at that



period, one revealed an American superstition by no means



unusual.  The circumstances which led to it were as follows:







An ample fund, said to be forty or fifty thousand



dollars, had been brought together in Philadelphia for the



erection of an equestrian statue to Washington, and it had



been finally decided to intrust the commission to Professor



Siemering, one of the most eminent of modern German



sculptors.  One day there came to me a letter from



an American gentleman whom I had met occasionally



many years before, asking me to furnish him with a full



statement regarding Professor Siemering's works and



reputation.  As a result, I made inquiries among the leading



authorities on modern art, and, everything being most



favorable, I at last visited his studio, and found a large



number of designs and models of works on which he



was then engaged,--two or three being of the highest



importance, among them the great war monument at



Leipsic.







I also found that, although he had executed and was



executing important works for various other parts of



Germany, he had not yet put up any great permanent



work in Berlin, though the designs of the admirable



temporary statues and decorations on the return of the troops



from the Franco-Prussian War to the metropolis had



been intrusted largely to him.







These facts I stated to my correspondent in a letter, and



in due time received an answer in substance as follows:











SIR:  Your letter confirms me in the opinion I had formed. 



The intrusting of the great statue of Washington to a man like



Siemering is a job and an outrage.  It is clear that he is a mere



pretender, since he has erected no statue as yet in Berlin.  That



statue of the Father of our Country ought to have been intrusted



to native talent.  I have a son fourteen years old who has



already



greatly distinguished himself.  He has modeled a number of



figures in butter and putty which all my friends think are most



remarkable.  I am satisfied that he could have produced a work



which, by its originality and power, would have done honor to



our country and to art.



                    Yours very truly,



                         ---- ----.











Curious, too, was the following:  One morning the mail



brought me a large packet filled with little squares of



cheap cotton cloth.  I was greatly puzzled to know their



purpose until, a few days later, there came a letter which,



with changes of proper names, ran as follows:







                            PODUNK, ----, 1880.







SIR:  We are going to have a fancy fair for the benefit of the



---- Church in this town, and we are getting ready some autograph



bed-quilts.  I have sent you a package of small squares of



cotton cloth, which please take to the Emperor William and his



wife, also to Prince Bismarck and the other princes and leading



persons of Germany, asking them to write their names on them



and send them to me as soon as possible.



                         Yours truly,



                            ---- ----.











P.S. Tell them to be sure to write their names in the middle



of the pieces, for fear that their autographs may get sewed in.











My associations with the diplomatic corps I found



especially pleasing.  The dean, as regarded seniority, was



the Italian ambassador, Count Delaunay, a man of large



experience and kindly manners.  He gave me various



interesting reminiscences of his relations with Cavour, and



said that when he was associated with the great Italian



statesman, the latter was never able to get time for him,



except at five o'clock in the morning, and that this was



their usual hour of work.







Another very interesting person was the representative



of Great Britain--Lord Odo Russell.  He was full of



interesting reminiscences of his life at Washington, at Rome,



and at Versailles with Bismarck.  As to Rome, he gave me



interesting stories of Pope Pius IX, who, he said, was



inclined to be jocose, and even to speak in a sportive way



regarding exceedingly serious subjects.[14]  As to Cavour,



he thought him a greater man even than Bismarck; and



this from a man so intimate with the German chancellor



was a testimony of no small value.











[14] One of these reminiscences I have given elsewhere.











As to his recollections of Versailles, he was present at



the proclamation of the Empire in the Galerie des Glaces,



and described the scene to me very vividly.







His relations with Bismarck were very close, and the



latter once paid him a compliment which sped far; saying



that, as a rule, he distrusted an Englishman who spoke



French very correctly, but that there was one exception--



Lord Odo Russell.







At the risk of repeating a twice-told tale, I may refer



here to his visit to Bismarck when the latter complained



that he was bothered to death with bores who took his



most precious time, and asked Lord Odo how he got rid



of them.  After making some reply, the latter asked



Bismarck what plan he had adopted.  To this the chancellor



answered that he and Johanna (the princess) had hit



upon a plan, which was that when she thought her husband



had been bored long enough, she came in with a bottle



and said, ``Now, Otto, you know that it is time for you



to take your medicine.''  Hardly were the words out of



his mouth, when in came the princess with the bottle and



repeated the very words which her husband had just



given.  Both burst into titanic laughter, and parted on



the best of terms.







At court festivities, Lord Odo frequently became very



weary, and as I was often in the same case, we from time



to time went out of the main rooms together and sat



down in some quiet nook for a talk.  On one of these



occasions, just after he had been made a peer with the



title of Baron Ampthill, I said to him, ``You must allow



me to use my Yankee privilege of asking questions.'' 



On his assenting to this pleasantly, I asked, ``Why is it



that you are willing to give up the great historic name



of Russell and take a name which no one ever heard of?'' 



He answered, ``I have noticed that when men who have



been long in the diplomatic service return to England,



they become in many cases listless and melancholy, and



wander about with no friends and nothing to do.  They



have been so long abroad that they are no longer in touch



with leading men at home, and are therefore shelved. 



Entrance into the House of Lords gives a man something



to do, with new friends and pleasing relations.  As to the



name, I would gladly have retained my own, but had no



choice; in fact, when Lord John Russell was made an



earl, his insisting on retaining his name was not



especially liked.  Various places on the Russell estates were



submitted to me for my choice, and I took Ampthill.''







Alas! his plans came to nothing.  He died at his post



before his retirement to England.







Among those then connected with the British Embassy



at Berlin, one of the most interesting was Colonel (now



General) Lord Methuen, who, a few years since, took so



honorable a part in the South African War.  He was at



that time a tall, awkward man, kindly, genial, who always



reminded me of Thackeray's ``Major Sugarplums.'' 



He had recently lost his wife, and was evidently in deep



sorrow.  One morning there came a curious bit of news



regarding him.  A few days before, walking in some



remote part of the Thiergarten, he saw a working-man throw



himself into the river, and instantly jumped into the icy



stream after him, grappled him, pulled him out, laid him



on the bank, and rapidly walked off.  When news of



it got out, he was taxed with it by various members of



the diplomatic corps; but he awkwardly and blushingly



pooh-poohed the whole matter.







One evening, not long afterward, I witnessed a very



pleasant scene connected with this rescue.  As we were all



assembled at some minor festivity in the private palace



on the Linden, the old Emperor sent for the colonel, and



on his coming up, his Majesty took from his own coat



a medal of honor for life-saving and attached it to the



breast of Methuen, who received it in a very awkward



yet manly fashion.







The French ambassador was the Count de St. Vallier,



one of the most agreeable men I have ever met, who



deserved all the more credit for his amiable qualities



because he constantly exercised them despite the most



wretched health.  During his splendid dinners at the



French Embassy, he simply toyed with a bit of bread, not



daring to eat anything.







We were first thrown especially together by a



representation in favor of the double standard of value, which,



under instructions from our governments, we jointly



made to the German Foreign Office, and after that our



relations became very friendly.  Whenever the Fourth



of July or Washington's Birthday came round, he was



sure to remember it and make a friendly call.







My liking for him once brought upon me one of the



most embarrassing mishaps of my life.  It was at Nice,



and at the table d'h<o^>te of a great hotel on the Promenade



des Anglais, where I was seated next a French countess



who, though she had certainly passed her threescore



years and ten, was still most agreeable.  Day after day



we chatted together, and all went well; but one evening,



on our meeting at table as usual, she said, ``I am told that



you are the American minister at Berlin.''  I answered,



``Yes, madam.''  She then said, ``When I was a young



woman, I was well acquainted with the mother of the



present French ambassador there.''  At this I launched



out into praises of Count St. Vallier, as well I might;



speaking of the high regard felt for him at Berlin, the



honors he had received from the German Government,



and the liking for him among his colleagues.  The countess



listened in silence, and when I had finished turned



severely upon me, saying, ``Monsieur, up to this moment



I have believed you an honest man; but now I really don't



know what to think of you.''  Of course I was dumfounded,



but presently the reason for the remark occurred



to me, and I said, ``Madam, M. de St. Vallier serves



France.  Whatever his private opinions may be, he no



doubt feels it his duty to continue in the service of his



country.  It would certainly be a great pity if, at every



change of government in France, every officer who did



not agree with the new r<e'>gime should leave the diplomatic



service or the military service or the naval service, thus



injuring the interests of France perhaps most seriously. 



Suppose the Comte de Chambord should be called to the



throne of France, what would you think of Orleanists



and republicans who should immediately resign their



places in the army, navy, and diplomatic service, thus



embarrassing, perhaps fatally, the monarchy and the



country?''  At this, to my horror, the lady went into



hysterics, and began screaming.  She cried out, ``Oui,



monsieur, il reviendra, Henri Cinq; il reviendra.  Dieu



est avec lui; il reviendra malgr<e'> tout,'' etc., etc., and



finally she jumped up and rushed out of the room.  The 



eyes of the whole table were turned upon us, and I fully



expected that some gallant Frenchman would come up



and challenge me for insulting a lady; but no one moved,



and presently all went on with their dinners.  The next



day the countess again appeared at my side, amiable as



ever, but during the remainder of my stay I kept far



from every possible allusion to politics.







The Turkish ambassador, Sadoullah Bey, was a kindly



gentleman who wandered about, as the French expressively 



say, ``like a damn<e'>d soul.''  Something seemed to



weigh upon him heavily and steadily.  A more melancholy



human being I have never seen, and it did not surprise



me, a few years later, to be told that, after one of the



palace revolutions at Constantinople, he had been executed



for plotting the assassination of the Sultan.







The Russian ambassador, M. de Sabouroff, was a very



agreeable man, and his rooms were made attractive by



the wonderful collection of Tanagra statuettes which he



had brought from Greece, where he had formerly been



minister.  In one matter he was especially helpful to me. 



One day I received from Washington a cipher despatch



instructing me to exert all my influence to secure the



release of Madame ----, who, though married to a former



Russian secretary of legation, was the daughter of an



American eminent in politics and diplomacy.  The case



was very serious.  The Russian who had married this



estimable lady had been concerned in various shady



transactions, and, having left his wife and little children



in Paris, had gone to Munich in the hope of covering



up some doubtful matters which were coming to light. 



While on this errand he was seized and thrown into jail



whereupon he telegraphed his wife to come to him.  His



idea, evidently, was that when she arrived she also would



be imprisoned, and that her family would then feel forced



to intervene with the money necessary to get them both



out.  The first part of the programme went as he had



expected.  His wife, on arriving in Munich, was at once



thrown into prison, and began thence sending to the



Secretary of State and to me the most distressing letters



and telegrams.  She had left her little children in Paris,



and was in agony about them.  With the aid of the



Russian ambassador, who acknowledged that his compatriot



was one of the worst wretches in existence, I obtained



the release of the lady from prison after long negotiations. 



Unfortunately, I was obliged to secure that of her



husband at the same time; but as he died not long afterward,



he had no opportunity to do much more harm.







Of the ministers plenipotentiary, the chief was Baron



Nothomb of Belgium, noted as the ``Belgian father of



constitutional liberty.''  He was a most interesting old



man, especially devoted to the memory of my predecessor,



Bancroft, and therefore very kind to me.  Among



the reminiscences which he seemed to enjoy giving me



at his dinner-table were many regarding Talleyrand,



whom he had personally known.







Still another friend among the ministers was M. de



Rudhardt, who represented Bavaria.  He and his wife



were charming, and they little dreamed of the catastrophe



awaiting them when he should cross Bismarck's path. 



The story of this I shall recount elsewhere.[15]











[15] See chapter on Bismarck.











Yet another good friend was Herr von Nostitz-Wallwitz,



representative of Saxony, who was able, on one



occasion, to render a real service to American education. 



Two or three young ladies, one of whom is now the



admired head of one of the foremost American colleges for



women, were studying at the University of Leipsic.  I



had given them letters to sundry professors there, and



nothing could be better than the reports which reached



me regarding their studies, conduct, and social standing. 



But one day came very distressing telegrams and letters,



and, presently, the ladies themselves.  A catastrophe had



come.  A decree had gone forth from the Saxon Government



at Dresden expelling all women students from the



university, and these countrywomen of mine begged me



to do what I could for them.  Remembering that my



Saxon colleague was the brother of the prime minister of



Saxony, I at once went to him.  On my presenting the



case, he at first expressed amazement at the idea of women



being admitted to the lecture-rooms of a German



university; but as I showed him sundry letters,



especially those from Professors Georg Curtius and Ebers,



regarding these fair students, his conservatism melted



away and he presently entered heartily into my view, the



result being that the decree was modified so that all lady



students then in the university were allowed to remain



until the close of their studies, but no new ones were to



be admitted afterward.  Happily, all this has been changed,



and to that, as to nearly all other German universities,



women are now freely admitted.







Very amusing at times were exhibitions of gentle sarcasm



on the part of sundry old diplomatists.  They had



lived long, had seen the seamy side of public affairs, and



had lost their illusions.  One evening, at a ball given by



the vice-chancellor of the empire which was extremely



splendid and no less tedious, my attention was drawn to



two of them.  There had been some kind of absurd



demonstration that day in one of the principal European



parliaments, and coming upon my two colleagues, I



alluded to it.







``Yes,'' said Baron Jauru of Brazil, ``that comes of the



greatest lie prevalent in our time--the theory that the



majority of mankind are WISE; now it is an absolute fact



which all history teaches, and to-day even more than ever,



that all mankind are FOOLS.''  ``What you say is true,''



replied M. de Quade, the Danish minister, ``but it is not



the WHOLE truth: constitutional government also goes



on the theory that all mankind are GOOD; now it is an



absolute fact that all mankind are bad, utterly BAD.'' ``Yes,''



said Jauru, ``I accept your amendment; mankind are



fools and knaves.''  To this I demurred somewhat, and



quoted Mr. Lincoln's remark, ``You can fool some of the



people all the time, and all of the people some of the time;



but you can't fool all the people all the time.''







This restored their good humor, and I left them smilingly



pondering over this nugget of Western wisdom.







Interesting to me was the contrast between my two



colleagues from the extreme Orient.  Then and since at



Berlin I have known the Japanese Minister Aoki.  Like all



other Japanese diplomatic representatives I have met,



whether there or elsewhere, he was an exceedingly



accomplished man: at the first dinner given me after my



arrival in Berlin he made an admirable speech in German,



and could have spoken just as fluently and accurately in



French or English.







On the other hand, Li Fong Pao, the Chinese representative,



was a mandarin who steadily wore his Chinese costume,



pigtail and all, and who, though jolly, could speak



only through an interpreter who was almost as difficult to



understand as the minister himself.







Thus far it seems the general rule that whereas the



Japanese, like civilized nations in general, train men



carefully for foreign service in international law, modern



languages, history, and the like, the Chinese, like



ourselves, do little, if anything, of the kind.  But I may add



that recently there have been some symptoms of change



on their part.  One of the most admirable speeches during



the Peace Conference at The Hague was made by a



young and very attractive Chinese attach<e'>.  It was in



idiomatic French; nothing could be more admirable either



as regarded matter or manner; and many of the older



members of the conference came afterward to congratulate



him upon it.  The ability shown by the Chinese Minister



Wu at Washington would also seem to indicate that China



has learned something as to the best way of maintaining



her interests abroad.







This suggests another incident.  In the year 1880 the



newspapers informed us that the wife of the Chinese minister



at Berlin had just sailed from China to join her



husband.  The matter seemed to arouse general interest,



and telegrams announced her arrival at Suez, then at



Marseilles, then at Cologne, and finally at Berlin.  On



the evening of her arrival at court the diplomatic corps



were assembled, awaiting her appearance.  Presently the



great doors swung wide, and in came the Chinese minister



with his wife: he a stalwart mandarin in the full attire



of his rank; she a gentle creature in an exceedingly pretty



Chinese costume, tripping along on her little feet, and



behind her a long array of secretaries, interpreters, and



the like, many in Chinese attire, but some in European



court costume.  After all of us had been duly presented



to the lady by his Chinese excellency, he brought her



secretaries and presented them to his colleagues.  Among



these young diplomatists was a fine-looking man,



evidently a European, in a superb court costume frogged



and barred with gold lace.  As my Chinese colleague



introduced him to me in German, we continued in that



language, when suddenly this secretary said to me in



English, ``Mr. White, I don't see why we should be talking



in German; I was educated at Rochester University under



your friend, President Anderson, and I come from Waterloo



in Western New York.''  Had he dropped through



the ceiling, I could hardly have been more surprised. 



Neither Waterloo, though a thriving little town upon the New



York Central Railroad and not far from the city in which



I have myself lived, nor even Rochester with all the added



power of its excellent university, seemed adequate to



develop a being so gorgeous.  On questioning him, I found



that, having been graduated in America, he had gone to



China with certain missionaries, and had then been taken



into the Chinese service.  It gives me very great pleasure



to say that at Berlin, St. Petersburg, and The Hague,



where I have often met him since, he has proved to be



a thoroughly intelligent and patriotic man.  Faithful to



China while not unmindful of the interests of the United



States, in one matter he rendered a very great service



to both countries.







But a diplomatic representative who has a taste for



public affairs makes acquaintances outside the diplomatic



corps, and is likely to find his relations with the ministers



of the German crown and with members of the parliament



very interesting.  The character of German public



men is deservedly high, and a diplomatist fit to represent



his country should bring all his study and experience



to bear in eliciting information likely to be useful to his



country from these as well as from all other sorts and



conditions of men.  My own acquaintance among these



was large.  I find in my diaries accounts of conversations



with such men as Bismarck, Camphausen, Delbr<u:>ck, Windthorst,



Bennigsen, George von Bunsen, Lasker, Treitschke,



Gneist, and others; but to take them up one after the



other would require far too much space, and I must be



content to jot down what I received from them wherever,



in the course of these reminiscences, it may seem



pertinent.















CHAPTER XXXI







MEN OF NOTE IN BERLIN AND ELSEWHERE--1879-1881







My acquaintance at Berlin extended into regions



which few of my diplomatic colleagues explored,



especially among members of the university faculty and



various other persons eminent in science, literature, and



art.







Writing these lines, I look back with admiration and



affection upon three generations of Berlin professors:



the first during my student days at the Prussian capital



in 1855-1856, the second during my service as minister,



1879-1881, and the third during my term as ambassador



1897-1902.







The second of these generations seems to me the most



remarkable of the three.  It was a wonderful body of men. 



A few of them I had known during my stay in Berlin as a



student; and of these, first in the order of time, Lepsius,



the foremost Egyptologist of that period, whose lectures



had greatly interested me, and whose kindly characteristics



were the delight of all who knew him.







Ernst Curtius, the eminent Greek scholar and historian,



was also very friendly.  He was then in the midst of his



studies upon the famous Pergamon statues, which, by



skilful diplomacy, the German Government had obtained



from the Turkish authorities in Asia Minor, and brought



to the Berlin Museum.  He was also absorbed in the



excavations at Olympia, and above all in the sculptures found



there.  One night at court he was very melancholy, and on



my trying to cheer him, he told me, in a heartbroken tone,



that Bismarck had stopped the appropriations for the



Olympia researches; but toward the end of the evening he



again sought me, his face radiant, and with great glee told



me that all was now right, that he had seen the Emperor,



and that the noble old monarch had promised to provide



for the excavations from his own purse.







Still another friend was Rudolf von Gneist, the most



eminent authority of his time upon Roman law and the English



constitution.  He had acted, in behalf of the Emperor



William, as umpire between the United States and Great



Britain, with reference to the northwestern boundary, and



had decided in our favor.  In recognition of his labor, the



American Government sent over a large collection of valuable



books on American history, including various collections



of published state papers; and the first duty I ever



discharged as minister was to make a formal presentation



of this mass of books to him.  So began one of my most



cherished connections.







Especially prized by me was a somewhat close acquaintance



with the two most eminent professors of modern history



then at the university--Von Sybel and Droysen. 



Each was a man of great ability.  One day, after I had



been reading Lanfrey's ``Histoire de Napol<e'>on,'' which



I then thought, and still think, one of the most eloquent and



instructive books of the nineteenth century, Von Sybel



happened to drop in, and I asked his opinion of it.  He



answered:  ``It does not deserve to be called a history; it



is a rhapsody.''  Shortly after he had left, in came



Droysen, and to him I put the same question, when he held up



both hands and said:  ``Yes, there is a history indeed! 



That is a work of genius; it is one of the books which



throw a bright light into a dark time: that book will live.''







Professor Hermann Grimm was then at the climax of



his fame, and the gods of his idolatry were Goethe and



Emerson; but apparently he did not resemble them in



soaring above the petty comforts and vexations of life. 



Any one inviting him to dine was likely to receive an



answer asking how the dining-room was lighted--whether



by gas, oil, or wax; also how the lights were placed--



whether high or low; and what the principal dishes were to be:



and on the answer depended his acceptance or declination. 



Dining with him one night, I was fascinated by his wife; it



seemed to me that I had never seen a woman of such



wonderful and almost weird powers: there was something



exquisitely beautiful in her manner and conversation; and,



on my afterward speaking of this to another guest, he



answered:  ``Why, of course; she is the daughter of Goethe's



Bettina, to whom he wrote the `Letters to a Child.' ''







Another historian was Treitshke, eminent also as a



member of parliament--a man who exercised great power



in various directions, and would have been delightful but



for his deafness.  A pistol might have been fired beside



him, and he would never have known it.  Wherever he was,



he had with him a block of paper leaves and a pencil, by



means of which he carried on conversation; in parliament



he always had at his side a shorthand-writer who took



down the debates for him.







Some of the most interesting information which I



received regarding historical and current matters in Berlin



was from the biologist Du Bois-Reymond.  He was of



Huguenot descent, but was perhaps the most anti-Gallic



man in Germany.  Discussing the results of the expulsion



of the Huguenots under Louis XIV, the details he gave me



were most instructive.  Showing me the vast strength



which the Huguenots transferred from France to



Germany, he mentioned such men as the eminent lawyer



Savigny, the great merchant Raven<e'>, and a multitude of



other men of great distinction, who, like himself, had



retained their French names; and he added very many



prominent people of Huguenot descent who had changed



their French names into German.  He then referred to a



similar advantage given to various other countries, and



made a most powerful indictment against the intolerance



for which France has been paying such an enormous price



during more than two hundred years.







Interesting in another way were two men eminent in



physical science--Helmholtz and Hoffmann.  Meeting



them one evening at a court festivity, I was told by



Hoffmann of an experience of his in Scotland.  He had



arrived in Glasgow late on Saturday night, and on Sunday



morning went to call on Professor Sir William Thomson,



now Lord Kelvin.  The door-bell was answered by a woman



servant, of whom Hoffmann asked if Sir William was



at home.  To this the servant answered, ``Sir, he most



certainly is not.''  Hoffmann then asked, ``Could you tell



me where I might find him?''  She answered, ``Sir, you



will find him at church, where YOU ought to be.''







My acquaintance with university men was not confined



to Berlin; at Leipsic, Halle, Giessen, Heidelberg, and



elsewhere, I also found delightful professorial circles.  In my



favorite field, I was especially struck with the historian



Oncken.  As a lecturer he was perfect; and I have often



advised American historical students to pass a semester,



if not more, at Giessen, in order to study his presentation



of historical subjects.  As to manner, he was the best



lecturer on history I heard in Germany; and, with the



exception of Laboulaye at the Coll<e!>ge de France, Seelye at



English Cambridge, and Goldwin Smith at Cornell, the



best I ever heard anywhere.







Especially delightful were sundry men of letters.  Of



these I knew best Auerbach, whose delightful ``Dorfgeschichten''



were then in full fame.  He had been a warm



personal friend of Bayard Taylor, and this friendship I



inherited.  Many were the walks and talks we took



together in the Thiergarten, and he often lighted up my



apartment with his sunny temper.  But one day, as he



came in, returning from his long vacation, I said to him:



``So you have been having a great joy at the unveiling of



the Spinoza statue at The Hague.''  ``A great joy!'' he



said.  ``Bewahre! far from it; it was wretched--



miserable.''  I asked, ``How could that be?''  He answered,



``Renan, Kuno Fischer, and myself were invited to make



addresses at the unveiling of the statue; but when we



arrived at the spot, we found that the Dutch Calvinist domi-



nies and the Jewish rabbis had each been preaching to



their flocks that the judgments of Heaven would fall upon



the city if the erection of a statue to such a monstrous



atheist were permitted, and the authorities had to station



troops to keep the mob from stoning us and pulling down



the statue.  Think of such a charge against the 



`Gottbetrunkener Mensch,' who gave new proofs of God's 



existence, who saw God in everything!''







Another literary man whom I enjoyed meeting was



Julius Rodenberg; his ``Reminiscences of Berlin,'' which



I have read since, seem to me the best of their kind.







I also came to know various artists, one of them being



especially genial.  Our first meeting was shortly after my



arrival, at a large dinner, where, as the various guests were



brought up to be introduced to the new American minister,



there was finally presented a little, gentle, modest man as



``Herr Knaus.''  I never dreamed of his being the foremost



genre-painter in Europe; and, as one must say something,



I said, ``You are, perhaps, a relative of the famous



painter.''  At this he blushed deeply, seemed greatly



embarrassed, and said:  ``A painter I am; famous, I don't



know.  (Maler bin ich; ber<u:>hmt, das weiss ich nicht.)'' 



So began a friendship which has lasted from that day to



this.  I saw the beginning, middle, and end of some of his



most beautiful pictures, and, above all, of the ``Hinter



den Coulissen,'' which conveys a most remarkable



philosophical and psychological lesson, showing how near mirth



lies to tears.  It is the most comic and most pathetic of



pictures.  I had hoped that it would go to America; but,



after being exhibited to the delight of all parts of



Germany, it was bought for the royal gallery at Dresden.







Very friendly also was Carl Becker.  His ``Coronation



of Ulrich von Hutten,'' now at Cologne, of which he allowed



me to have a copy taken, has always seemed to me



an admirable piece of historical painting.  In it there is



a portrait of a surly cardinal-bishop; and once, during an



evening at Becker's house, having noticed a study for this



bishop's head, I referred to it, when he said:  ``Yes, that



bishop is simply the sacristan of an old church in Venice,



and certainly the most dignified ecclesiastic I have ever



seen.''  The musical soir<e'>es at Becker's beautiful



apartments were among the delights of my stay both then and



during my more recent embassy.







Very delightfully dwell in my memory, also, some



evenings at the palace, when, after the main ceremonies were



over, Knaus, Becker, and Auerbach wandered with me



through the more distant apartments and galleries,



pointing out the beauties and characteristics of various old



portraits and pictures.  In one long gallery lined with the



portraits of brides who, during the last three centuries,



had been brought into the family of Hohenzollern, we



lingered long.







Then began also my friendship with Anton von Werner. 



He had been present at the proclamation of the Emperor



William I in the great ``Hall of Mirrors'' at Versailles, by



express invitation, in order that he might prepare his



famous painting of that historic scene.  I asked him whether



the inscription on the shield in the cornice of the Galerie



des Glaces, ``Passage du Rhin,'' which glorified one of the



worst outrages committed by Louis XIV upon Germany,



was really in the place where it is represented in his



picture.  He said that it was.  It seemed a divine prophecy



of retribution.







The greatest genius in all modern German art--Adolf



Menzel--I came to know under rather curious circumstances. 



He was a little man, not more than four feet



high, with an enormous head, as may be seen by his bust



in the Berlin Museum.  On being presented to him during



an evening at court, I said to him:  ``Herr Professor, in



America I am a teacher of history; and of all works I



have ever seen on the history of Frederick the Great, your



illustrations of Kugler's history have taught me most.'' 



This was strictly true; for there are no more striking



works of genius in their kind than those engravings which



throw a flood of light into that wonderful period.  At this



he invited me to visit his studio, which a few days later I 



did, and then had a remarkable exhibition of some of his



most curious characteristics.







Entering the room, I saw, just at the right, a large



picture, finely painted, representing a group of Frederick's



generals, and in the midst of them Frederick himself,



merely outlined in chalk.  I said, ``There is a picture



nearly finished.''  Menzel answered, ``No; it is not finished



and never will be.''  I asked, ``Why not?''  He said,



``I don't deny that there is some good painting in it.  But



it is on the eve of the battle of Leuthen; it is the



consultation of Frederick the Great with his generals just



before that terrible battle; and men don't look like that just



before a struggle in which the very existence of their



country is at stake, and in which they know that most of



them must lay down their lives.''







We then passed on to another.  This represented the



great Gens d'Armes Church at Berlin; at the side of it,



piled on scaffoldings, were a number of coffins all decked



with wreaths and flowers; and in the foreground a crowd



of beholders wonderfully painted.  All was finished except



one little corner; and I said, ``Here is one which you



will finish.''  He said, ``No; never.  That represents the



funeral of the Revolutionists killed here in the uprising of



1848.  Up to this point''--and he put his finger on the



unfinished corner--``I believed in it; but when I arrived at



this point, I said to myself, `No; nothing good can come



out of that sort of thing; Germany is not to be made by



street fights.'  I shall never finish it.''







We passed on to another.  This was finished.  It



represented the well-known scene of the great Frederick



blundering in upon the Austrian bivouac at the castle of Lissa,



when he narrowly escaped capture.  I said to him, ``There



at least is a picture which is finished.''  ``Yes,'' he said;



``but the man who ordered it will never get it.''  I saw



that there was a story involved, and asked, ``How is



that?''  He answered, ``That picture was painted on the



order of the Duke of Ratibor, who owns the castle.  When



it was finished he came to see it, but clearly thought it



too quiet.  What he wanted was evidently something in



the big, melodramatic style.  I said nothing; but meeting



me a few days afterward, he said, `Why don't you send



me my picture?'  `No,' I said; `Serene Highness, that



picture is mine.'  `No, said he; `you painted it for me; it is



mine.'  `No,' said I; `I shall keep it.'  His Highness shall



never have it.''







My principal recreation was in excursions to historical



places.  Old studies of German history had stimulated a



taste for them, and it was a delight to leave Berlin on



Saturday and stay in one of these towns over Sunday. 



Frequently my guide was Frederick Kapp, a thoughtful



historian and one of the most charming of men.







A longer pilgrimage was made to the mystery-play at



Oberammergau.  There was an immense crowd; and, as



usual, those in the open, in front of our box, were drenched



with rain, as indeed were many of the players on the



stage.  I had ``come to scoff, but remained to pray.'' 



There was one scene where I had expected a laugh--



namely, where Jonah walks up out of the whale's belly. 



But when it arrived we all remained solemn.  It was



really impressive.  We sat there from nine in the morning



until half-past twelve, and then from half-past one



until about half-past four, under a spell which banished



fatigue.  The main point was that the actors BELIEVED



in what they represented; there was nothing in it



like that vague, wearisome exhibition of ``religiosity''



which, in spite of its wonderful overture, gave me, some



years afterward, a painful disenchantment--the ``Parsifal''



at Bayreuth.







At the close of the Passion Play, I sought out some of



the principal actors, and found them kindly and interesting. 



To the Christus I gave a commission for a carved



picture-frame, and this he afterward executed beautifully. 



With the Judas, who was by far the best actor in the whole



performance, I became still better acquainted.  Visiting



his workshop, after ordering of him two carved statuettes I



said to him:  ``You certainly ought to have a double salary,



as the Judas had in the miracle-plays of the middle ages;



this was thought due him on account of the injury done



to his character by his taking that part.''  At this the



Oberammergau Judas smiled pleasantly, and said:  ``No;



I am content to share equally with the others; but the



same feeling toward the Judas still exists''; and he then



told me the following story:  A few weeks before, while



he was working at his carving-bench, the door of his



workshop opened, and a peasant woman from the mountains



came in, stood still, and gazed at him intently.  On his



asking her what she wanted, she replied:  ``I saw you in the



play yesterday; I wished to look at you again; you look



so like my husband.  He is dead.  HE, TOO, WAS A VERY BAD



MAN.''







Occasionally, under leave of absence from the State



Department, I was able to make more distant excursions,



and first of all into France.  The President during one of



these visits was M. Gr<e'>vy.  Some years before I had heard



him argue a case in court with much ability; but now, on



my presentation to him at the palace of the <E'>lys<e'>e, he



dwelt less ably on the relations of the United States with



France, and soon fell upon the question of trade, saying, in



rather a reproachful way, ``Vous nous inondez de vos produits.'' 



To this I could only answer that this inundation of



American products would surely be of mutual benefit to



both nations, and he rather slowly assented.







Much more interesting to me was his minister of foreign



affairs, Barth<e'>lemy-Saint-Hilaire, a scholar, a statesman,



and a man of noble character.  We talked first of my



intended journey to the south of France; and on my telling



him that I had sent my eldest son to travel there, for the



reason that at Orange, Arles, N<i^>mes, and the like, a better



idea of Roman power can be obtained than in Italy itself,



he launched out on that theme most instructively.







The conversation having turned toward politics, he



spoke much of Bismarck and Moltke, pronouncing the



name of the latter in one syllable.  He said that Bismarck



was very kind personally to Thiers during the terrible



negotiations; that if Bismarck could have had his way he



would have asked a larger indemnity,--say, seven



milliards,--and would have left Alsace-Lorraine to France;



that France would gladly have paid a much larger sum



than five milliards if she could have retained Alsace-



Lorraine; that Bismarck would have made concessions; but



that ``Molkt'' would not.  He added that Bismarck told



``Molkt'' that he--the latter--had, by insisting on territory,



made peace too difficult.  Saint-Hilaire dwelt long on



the fearful legacy of standing armies left by the policy



which Germany finally adopted, and evidently considered



a great international war as approaching.[16]











[16] December, 1880.











Dining afterward at the Foreign Office with my old



friend Millet, who was second in command there, I met



various interesting Frenchmen, but was most of all



pleased with M. Ribot.  Having distinguished himself by



philosophical studies and made a high reputation in the



French parliament, he was naturally on his way to the



commanding post in the ministry which he afterward



obtained.  His wife, an American, was especially attractive.







It is a thousand pities that a country possessing such



men is so widely known to the world, not by these, but by



novelists and dramatists largely retailing filth, journalists



largely given to the invention of sensational lies, politicians



largely obeying either atheistic demagogues or clerical



intriguers; and all together acting like a swarm of



obscene, tricky, mangy monkeys chattering, squealing,



and tweaking one another's tails in a cage.  Some of these



monkeys I saw performing their antics in the National



Assembly then sitting at Versailles; and it saddened me



to see the nobler element in that assemblage thwarted by



such featherbrained creatures.[16]











[16] December, 1880.











Another man of note, next whom I found myself at a



dinner-party, was M. de Lesseps.  I still believe him to



have been a great and true man, despite the cloud of



fraud which the misdeeds of others drew over his latter



days.  Among sundry comments on our country, he said



that he had visited Salt Lake City, and thought a policy



of force against the Mormons a mistake.  In this I feel



sure that he was right.  Years ago I was convinced by



Bishop Tuttle of the Protestant Episcopal Church, who



had been stationed for some years at Salt Lake City, that



a waiting policy, in which proper civilization can be



brought to bear upon the Mormons, is the true course.







On the following Sunday I heard P<e!>re Hyacinthe



preach, as at several visits before; but the only thing at



all memorable was a rather happy application of Voltaire's



remark on the Holy Roman Empire, ``Ni Saint, ni



Empire, ni Romain.''







At the salon of Madame Edmond Adam, eminent as a



writer of review articles and as a hater of everything



Teutonic, I was presented to a crowd of literary men who,



though at that moment striking the stars with their lofty



heads, have since dropped into oblivion.  Among these I



especially remember <E'>mile de Girardin, editor, spouter,



intriguer--the ``Grand <E'>mile,'' who boasted that he



invented and presented to the French people a new idea



every day.  This futile activity of his always seemed to me



best expressed in the American simile:  ``Busy as a bee in



a tar-barrel.''  There was, indeed, one thing to his credit:



he had somehow inspired his former wife, the gifted Delphine



Gay, with a belief in his greatness; and a pretty



story was current illustrating this.  During the revolution



of 1848, various men of note, calling on Madame Girardin,



expressed alarm at the progress of that most foolish of



overturns, when she said, with an air of great solemnity,



and pointing upward, ``Gentlemen, there is one above who



watches over France.  (Il y a un l<a!>-haut qui veille sur la



France.)''  All were greatly impressed by this evidence



of sublime faith, until the context showed that it was not



the Almighty in whom she put her trust, but the great



<E'>mile, whose study was just above her parlor.







This reminds me that, during my student days at Paris,



I attended the funeral of this gifted lady, and in the crowd



of well-known persons present noticed especially Alexandre 



Dumas.  He was very tall and large, with an African



head, thick lips, and bushy, crisp hair.  He evidently



intended to be seen.  His good-natured vanity was as



undisguised as when his famous son said of him in his



presence, ``My father is so vain that he is capable of



standing in livery behind his own carriage to make people



think he sports a negro footman.''







Going southward, I stopped at Bourges, and was



fascinated by the amazing stonework of the crypt.  How the



mediaeval cathedral-builders were able to accomplish such



intricate work with the means at their command is still



one of the great mysteries.  There is to-day in the United



States no group of workmen who could execute anything



approaching this work, to say nothing of such pieces as



the vaulting of Henry VII's Chapel at Westminster or of



King's College Chapel at Cambridge.







Thence we went to the Church of Brou, near Lyons--



exquisitely beautiful, and filled with monuments even



more inspiring than the church itself.  But it was entirely



evident, from a look at the church and its surroundings,



that Matthew Arnold had written his charming poem without



ever visiting the place.  Going thence to Nice, we



stopped at Turin; and at the grave of Silvio Pellico there



came back to me vivid memories of his little book, which



had seemed to make life better worth living.







At Genoa a decision had to be made.  A mass of letters



of introduction to leading Italians had been given me, and



I longed to make their acquaintance; but I was weary, and



suddenly decided to turn aside and go upon the Riviera,



where we settled for our vacation at Nice.  There we



found various interesting people, more especially those



belonging to the American colony and to the ship-of-war



Trenton, then lying at Villefranche, near by.  Shortly



after our arrival, Lieutenant Emery of the navy called,



bearing an invitation to the ship from Admiral Howell,



who was in command at that station; and, a day or two



later, on arriving in the harbor, though I saw a long-boat



dressed out very finely, evidently awaiting somebody, and



suspected that it was intended for me, I quietly evaded



the whole business by joining a party of Americans in a



steam-launch, so that I had been on board some little time



before the admiral realized the omission in his programme. 



As a result, in order to quiet his conscientious



and patriotic feelings, I came again a day or two



afterward, was conveyed to the frigate with the regulation



pomp, and received the salutes due an American minister. 



My stay on the ship was delightful; but, though the admiral



most kindly urged me to revisit him, I could never again



gather courage to cause so much trouble and make so much



noise.







Most interesting to me of all the persons in Nice at that



time was a young American about fourteen years of age,



who seemed to me one of the brightest and noblest and



most promising youths I had ever seen.  Alas! how many



hopes were disappointed in his death not long afterward! 



The boy was young Leland Stanford.  The aspirations of



his father and mother were bound up in him, and the great



university at Palo Alto is perhaps the finest monument



ever dedicated by parents to a child.







During another of these yearly absences in Italy, I met



various interesting men, and, among these, at Florence the



syndic Ubaldino Peruzzi, a descendant of the great Peruzzis



of the middle ages, and one of the last surviving



associates of Cavour.  He was an admirable talker; but of all



he said I was most pleased with the tribute which he paid



to the American minister at Rome, Judge Stallo of Cincinnati. 



He declared that at a recent conference of statesmen



and diplomatists, Judge Stallo had carried off all the honors--



speaking with ease, as might be necessary, in Italian,



French, and English, and finally drawing up a protocol



in Latin.







At Florence also I made an acquaintance which has



ever since been a source of great pleasure to me--that of



Professor Villari, senator of the kingdom, historian of



Florence, and biographer of Savonarola.  So began a



friendship which has increased the delights of many 



Florentine visits since those days--a friendship not only 



with him, but with his gifted and charming wife.







This reminds me that at Rome the name of the eminent



professor once brought upon me a curious reproof.







I had met at various times, in the Eternal City and



elsewhere, a rising young professor and officer of Harvard



University; and, being one morning in Loescher's famous



book-shop on the Corso, with a large number of purchases



about me, this gentleman came in and, looking them over,



was pleased to approve several of them.  Presently, on



showing him a volume just published and saying, ``There



is the new volume of Villari's history,'' I pronounced the



name of the author with the accent on the first syllable, as



any one acquainted with him knows that it ought to be



pronounced.  At this the excellent professor took the book,



but seemed to have something on his mind; and, having



glanced through it, he at last said, rather solemnly, ``Yes;



VillAri''--accenting strongly the second syllable--``is an



admirable writer.''  I accepted his correction meekly and



made no reply.  A thing so trivial would not be worth



remembering were it not one of those evidences, which



professors from other institutions in our country have not



infrequently experienced, of a ``certain condescension''



in sundry men who do honor to one or two of our oldest



and greatest universities.







Of all people at Rome I was most impressed by Marco



Minghetti.  A conversation with him I have given in



another chapter.







Reminiscences of that first official life of mine at Berlin



center, first of all, in Bismarck, and then in the two great



rulers who have since passed away--the old hero,



Emperor William I, and that embodiment of all qualities



which any man could ask for in a monarch, the crown



prince who afterward became the Emperor Frederick III.







Both were kindly, but the latter was especially winning. 



At different times I had the pleasure of meeting and talking



with him on various subjects; but perhaps the most



interesting of these interviews was one which took place



when it became my duty to conduct him through the



American exhibit in the International Fisheries Exhibition



at Berlin.







He had taken great interest in developing the fisheries



along the northern coast of Germany, and this exhibition



was the result.  One day he sent the vice-chancellor of the



empire to ask me whether it was not possible to secure



an exhibit from the United States, and especially the loan



of our wonderful collections from the Smithsonian Institution



and from the Fisheries Institution of Wood's Holl {sic}. 



To do this was difficult.  Before my arrival an attempt



had been made and failed.  Word had come from persons



high in authority at Washington that Congress could not



be induced to make the large appropriation required, and



that sending over the collections was out of the question. 





I promised to do what I could; and, remembering that



Fernando Wood of New York was chairman of the Committee



of Ways and Means in the House, and that Governor



Seymour, then living in retirement near Utica, was



his old political associate, and especially interested in re-



stocking the waters of New York State with fish, I sent



the ex-governor a statement of the whole case, and urged



him to present it fully to Mr. Wood.  Then I wrote in the



same vein to Senator Conkling, and, to my great satisfaction,



carried the day.  The appropriation was made



by Congress; and the collections were sent over under the



control of Mr. Brown Goode of the Smithsonian, perhaps



the most admirable man who could have been chosen out



of the whole world for that purpose.  The prince was



greatly delighted with all he saw, showed remarkable



intelligence in his questions, and, thanks to Mr. Goode's



assistance, he received satisfactory answers.  The result was



that the American exhibit took the great prize--the silver-



gilt vase offered by the Emperor William, which is now



in the National Museum at Washington.







The prince showed a real interest in everything of



importance in our country.  I remember his asking me



regarding the Brooklyn Bridge--how it could possibly be



sustained without guy-ropes.  Of course it was easy to



show him that while in the first of our great suspension-



bridges--that at Niagara--guy-ropes were admissible, at



Brooklyn they were not: since ships of war as well as



merchant vessels of the largest size must pass beneath it; and



I could only add that Roebling, who built it, was a man of



such skill and forethought that undoubtedly, with the



weight he was putting into it and the system of trusses



he was placing upon it, no guy-ropes would be needed.







On many occasions the prince showed thoughtful kindness



to members of my family as well as to myself, and



the news of his death gave me real sorrow.  It was a vast



loss to his country; no modern monarch has shown so



striking a likeness to Marcus Aurelius.







Hardly less hearty and kindly was the Emperor then



reigning--William I.  Naturally enough, he remembered,



above all who had preceded me, Mr. Bancroft.  His



first question at court generally was, ``How goes it



with your predecessor?  (Wie geht es mit Ihrem



Vorg<a:>nger?)'' and I always knew that by my ``predecessor''



he meant Bancroft.  When I once told him that Mr.



Bancroft, who was not far from the old Kaiser's age, had



bought a new horse and was riding assiduously every



day, the old monarch laughed heartily and dwelt on his



recollections of my predecessor, with his long white beard,



riding through the Thiergarten.







Pleasant to me was the last interview, on the presentation



of my letter of recall.  It was at Babelsberg, the



Emperor's country-seat at Potsdam; and he detained me



long, talking over a multitude of subjects in a way which



showed much kindly feeling.  Among other things, he



asked where my family had been staying through the



summer.  My answer was that we had been at a hotel near



the park or palace of Wilhelmsh<o:>he above Cassel; and



that we all agreed that he had been very magnanimous in



assigning to the Emperor Napoleon III so splendid a



prison and such beautiful surroundings.  To this he



answered quite earnestly, ``Yes; and he was very grateful



for it, and wrote me to say so; but, after all, that is by



no means the finest palace in Germany.''  To this I



answered, ``Your Majesty is entirely right; that I saw on



visiting the palace of W<u:>rzburg.''  At this he laughed



heartily, and said, ``Yes, I see that you understand it;



those old prince-bishops knew how to live.''  As a matter



of fact, various prince-bishops in the eighteenth century



impoverished their realms in building just such imitations



of Versailles as that sumptuous W<u:>rzburg Palace.







He then asked me, ``On what ship do you go to



America?'' and I answered, ``On the finest ship in your



Majesty's merchant navy--the Elbe.''  He then asked me



something about the ship; and when I had told him how



beautifully it was equipped,--it being the first of the



larger ships of the North German Lloyd,--he answered,



``Yes; what is now doing in the way of shipbuilding is



wonderful.  I received a letter from my son, the crown



prince, this morning, on that very subject.  He is at



Osborne, and has just visited a great English iron-clad



man-of-war.  It is wonderful; but it cost a million pounds



sterling.''  At this he raised his voice, and, throwing up



both hands, said very earnestly, ``We can't stand it; we



can't stand it.''







After this and much other pleasant chat, he put out his



hand and said, ``Auf Wiedersehen''; and so we parted,



each to take his own way into eternity.







The other farewells to me were also gratifying.  The



German press was very kindly in its references to my



departure; and just before I left Berlin a dinner was



given me in the great hall of the Kaiserhof by leading men



in parliamentary, professional, literary, and artistic



circles.  Kindly speeches were made by Gneist, Camphausen,



Delbr<u:>ck, George von Bunsen, and others--all forming a



treasure in my memory which, as long as life lasts, I can



never lose.















CHAPTER XXXII







MY RECOLLECTIONS OF BISMARCK--1879-1881







My first glimpse of Bismarck was obtained during one



of my journeys through middle Germany, about the



time, I think, of the Franco-Prussian War.  Arriving at



the Kissingen junction, we found a crowd gathered outside



the barriers, and all gazing at a railway-carriage



about to be attached to our train.  Looking toward this, I



recognized the face and form of the great North-German



statesman.  He was in the prime of life--sturdy, hearty,



and happy in the presence of his wife and children.  The



people at the station evidently knew what was needed; for



hardly had he arrived when waiters appeared, bearing



salvers covered with huge mugs of foaming beer.  Thereupon



Bismarck took two of the mugs in immediate succession;



poured their contents down his throat, evidently with



great gusto; and a burly peasant just back of me, unable



longer to restrain his admiration, soliloquized in a deep,



slow, guttural, reverberating rumble:  ``A-a-a-ber er sieht



sehr-r-r gut aus.''  So it struck me also; the waters of



Kissingen had evidently restored the great man, and he



looked like a Titan ready for battle.







My personal intercourse with him began in 1879, when,



as chancellor of the German Empire, he received me



as minister of the United States.  On my entering his



workroom, he rose; and it seemed to me that I had



never seen another man so towering save Abraham



Lincoln.  On either side of him were his two big, black



dogs, the Reichshunde; and, as he put out his hand



with a pleasant smile, they seemed to join kindly in the



welcome.







His first remark was that I seemed a young man to



undertake the duties of a minister, to which I made the



trite reply that time would speedily cure that defect.  The



conversation then ran, for a time, upon commonplace



subjects, but finally struck matters of interest to both our



countries.







There were then, as ever since, a great number of



troublesome questions between the two nations, and among



them those relating to Germans who, having gone over to



the United States just at the military age, had lived there



merely long enough to acquire citizenship, and had then



hastened back to Germany to enjoy the privileges of both



countries without discharging the duties of either.  These



persons had done great harm to the interests of bona-fide



German-Americans, and Bismarck evidently had an intense



dislike for them.  This he showed then and afterward;



but his tendencies to severity toward them were



tempted {sic} by the minister of foreign affairs, Von B<u:>low,



one of the most reasonable men in public business with



whom I have ever had to do, and father of the present



chancellor, who greatly resembles him.







But Bismarck's feeling against the men who had



acquired American citizenship for the purpose of evading



their duties in both countries did not prevent his taking



a great interest in Germans who had settled in the United



States and, while becoming good Americans, had preserved



an interest in the Fatherland.  He spoke of these,



with a large, kindly feeling, as constituting a bond between



the two nations.  Among other things, he remarked that



Germans living in the United States become more tractable



than in the land of their birth; that revolutionists



thus become moderates, and radicals conservatives; that



the word Einigkeit (union) had always a charm for them;



that it had worked both ways upon them for good, the



union of States in America leading them to prize the



union of states in Germany, and the evils of disunion in



Germany, which had been so long and painful, leading



them to abhor disunion in America.







The conversation then fell into ordinary channels, and I



took leave after another hearty shake of the hand and



various kind assurances.  A few days later came an invitation



to dinner with him; and I prized this all the more because



it was not to be an official, but a family dinner, and



was to include a few of his most intimate friends in the



ministry and the parliament.  On the invitation it was



stated that evening dress was not to be worn; and on my



arrival, accompanied by Herr von Schl<o:>tzer, at that time



the German minister in Washington, I found all the guests



arrayed in simple afternoon costume.  The table had a



patriarchal character.  At the head sat the prince; at his



side, in the next seat but one, his wife; while between them



was the seat assigned me, so that I enjoyed to the full the



conversation of both.  The other seats at the head of the



table were occupied by various guests; and then, scattered



along down, were members of the family and some personages



in the chancery who stood nearest the chief.  The



conversation was led by him, and soon took a turn



especially interesting.  He asked me whether there had ever



been a serious effort to make New York the permanent



capital of the nation.  I answered that there had not; that



both New York and Philadelphia were, for a short period



at the beginning of our national history, provisional



capitals; but that there was a deep-seated idea that the



permanent capital should not be a commercial metropolis, and



that unquestionably the placing of it at Washington was



decided, not merely by the central position of that city, but



also by the fact that it was an artificial town, never likely



to be a great business center; and I cited Thomas Jefferson's



saying, ``Great cities are great sores.''  He answered



that in this our founders showed wisdom; that the



French were making a bad mistake in bringing their



national legislature back from Versailles to Paris; that the



construction of the human body furnishes a good hint for



arrangements in the body politic; that, as the human brain



is held in a strong inclosure, and at a distance from the



parts of the body which are most active physically, so the



brain of the nation should be protected with the greatest



care, and should not be placed in the midst of a great,



turbulent metropolis.  To this I assented, but said that during



my attendance at sessions of the French legislative bodies,



both in my old days at Paris and more recently at Versailles,



it seemed to me that their main defects are those



of their qualities; that one of the most frequent occupations



of their members is teasing one another, and that



when they tease one another they are wonderfully witty;



that in the American Congress and in the British Parliament



members are more slow to catch a subtle comment or



scathing witticism; that the members of American and



British assemblies are more like large grains of cannon-



powder, through which ignition extends slowly, so that



there comes no sudden explosion; whereas in the French



Assembly the members are more like minute, bright



grains of rifle-powder, which all take fire at the same



moment, with instant detonation, and explosions sometimes



disastrous.  He assented to this, but insisted that the curse



of French assemblies had been the tyranny of city mobs,



and especially of mobs in the galleries of their assemblies;



that the worst fault possible in any deliberative body is



speaking to the galleries; that a gallery mob is sure to get



between the members and the country, and virtually



screen off from the assembly the interests of the country. 



To this I most heartily assented.







I may say here that there had not then been fully



developed in our country that monstrous absurdity which



we have seen in these last few years--national conventions



of the two parties trying to deliberate in the midst of



audiences of twelve or fifteen thousand people; a vast



mob in the galleries, often noisy, and sometimes hysterical,



frequently seeking to throw the delegates off their



bearings, to outclamor them, and to force nominations



upon them.







A little later, as we discussed certain recent books, I re-



ferred to Jules Simon's work on Thiers's administration. 



Bismarck said that Thiers, in the treaty negotiations at



Versailles, impressed him strongly; that he was a patriot;



that he seemed at that time like a Roman among Byzantines.







This statement astonished me.  If ever there existed a



man at the opposite pole from Bismarck, Thiers was certainly



that man.  I had studied him as a historian, observed



him as a statesman, and conversed with him as a



social being; and he had always seemed, and still seems,



to me the most noxious of all the greater architects of



ruin that France produced during the latter half of the



nineteenth century--and that is saying much.  His policy



was to discredit every government which he found existing,



in order that its ruins might serve him as a pedestal;



and, while he certainly showed great skill in mitigating



the calamities which he did so much to cause, his whole



career was damning.







By his ``History of the French Revolution'' he revived



the worst of the Revolution legend, and especially the



deification of destructiveness; by his ``History of the



Consulate and of the Empire,'' and his translation of the body of



Napoleon to France, he effectively revived the Napoleonic



legend.  The Queen of the French, when escaping from the



Tuileries in 1848, was entirely right in reproaching him



with undermining the constitutional monarchy of 1830;



and no man did more than he to arouse and maintain the



anti-German spirit which led to the Franco-Prussian War.







By his writings, speeches, and intrigues he aided in



upsetting, not only the rule of the Bourbons in 1830, but



the rule of Louis Philippe in 1848, the Second Republic



in 1851, and the Second Empire in 1870; and, had he



lived, he would doubtless have done the same by the present



Republic.







Louis Blanc, a revolutionist of another bad sort--so



common in France--who can ruin but NOT restore, once



said to me that Thiers's ``greatest power lay in his voicing



average, unthinking, popular folly; so that after one of his



speeches every fool in France would cry out with delight,



``Mais, voil<a!> mon opinion!''







Doubtless Bismarck was impressed, for the time being,



by Thiers's skill in negotiation; but it is perfectly evident,



from the recollections of various officials since published,



that his usual opinion of Thiers was not at all indicated



by his remark above cited.







Later the conversation fell upon travel; and, as he spoke



of his experiences in various parts of Europe, I recommended



America to him as a new field of observation--alluding



playfully to the city named after him, and suggesting



that he take his family with him upon a large steamer,



and, after seeing the more interesting things in the United



States, pass on around the world, calling at the Samoan



Islands, on which I had recently heard him speak in



parliament.  After some humorous objections to this plan,



he said that early in life he had a great passion for travel,



but that upon his father's death he was obliged to devote



himself to getting his estate in order; that ever since that



time his political duties had prevented his traveling much;



and that now he had lost the love of wandering, and in



place of it had gained a desire to settle down in the midst



of his family.







He spoke English so perfectly that I asked him how



much time he had spent in England.  He said, ``Very



little--in fact, only two or three days.''  He had made but



two short visits, one of them many years ago,--I think he



said in 1842,--the other during the exposition of 1862.  He



seemed much struck with the beauty of England, and said



that if his lot had been cast there he would have been very



happy as an English country gentleman; that he could not



understand how Englishmen are so prone to live outside



of their own country.  He spoke of various Englishmen,



and referred to Lord Dufferin, who had dined with him



the day before, as one of the most abstemious men he had



ever seen, drinking only a little claret and water.  Upon



my speaking of the great improvement which I had noted



in England during the last quarter of a century, so that



the whole country was becoming more and more like a



garden, he said that such a statement was hardly likely to



please thinking Englishmen; that they could hardly be



glad that England should become more and more like a



garden; ``for,'' he said, ``feeding a great nation from a



garden is like provisioning an army with plum cake.''







He then dwelt on the fact that Great Britain had become



more and more dependent for her daily bread on other



countries, and especially on the United States.







The conversation next turned to the management of



estates, and he remarked, in a bluff, hearty way, that his



father had desired him to become a clergyman; that there



was a pastor's living, worth, if I remember rightly, about



fifteen hundred thalers a year, which his father thought



should be kept in the family.  This led to some amusing



conversation between him and the princess on what his



life would have been under such circumstances, ending by



his saying jocosely to her, ``You probably think that if I



had become a pastor I would have been a better man.''  To



which she answered that this she would not say; that it



would not be polite.  ``But,'' she continued, ``I will say



this: that you would have been a happier man.''







He referred to some of my predecessors, speaking very



kindly of Bayard Taylor and George Bancroft; but both



he and the princess dwelt especially upon their relations



with Motley.  The prince told me of their life together at



G<o:>ttingen and at Berlin, and of Motley's visits since,



when he always became Bismarck's guest.  The princess



said that there was one subject on which it was always a



delight to tease Motley--his suppressed novel



``Merrymount''; that Motley defended himself ingeniously in



various ways until, at his last visit, being pressed hard, he



declared that the whole thing was a mere myth; that he



had never written any such novel.







The dinner being ended, our assembly was adjourned to



the terrace at the back of the chancellor's palace, looking



out upon the park in which he was wont to take his famous



midnight walks.  Coffee and cigars were brought, but for



Bismarck a pipe with a long wooden stem and a large



porcelain bowl.  It was a massive affair; and, in a jocose,



apologetic way, he said that, although others might smoke



cigars and cigarettes, he clung to the pipe--and in spite



of the fact that, at the Philadelphia Exposition, as he had



heard, a great German pipe was hung among tomahawks,



scalping-knives, and other relics of barbarism.  From time



to time a servant refilled his pipe, while he discoursed upon



various subjects--first upon the condition of America and



of Germany; then upon South American matters, and of



the struggle between Chile and other powers.  He showed



great respect for the Chileans, and thought that they manifested



really sterling qualities.







He spoke of ship-building, and showed, as it seemed to



me, rather a close knowledge of the main points involved. 



He referred to the superiority of Russian ships, the wood



used being more suitable than that generally found elsewhere. 



As to American ships, he thought they were built,



as a rule, of inferior woods, and that their reputation had



suffered in consequence.







The conversation again falling upon public men, a reference



of mine to Gladstone did not elicit anything like a



hearty response; but the mention of Disraeli seemed to



arouse a cordial feeling.







Among the guests was Lothar Bucher, whom Bismarck,



in earlier days, would have hanged if he had caught him,



but who had now become the chancellor's most confidential



agent; and, as we came out together, Bucher said:  ``Well,



what do you think of him?''  My answer was:  ``He seems



even a greater man than I had expected.''  ``Yes,'' said



Bucher; ``and I am one of those who have suffered much



and long to make him possible.''  I said:  ``The result is



worth it, is it not?''  ``Yes,'' was the reply; ``infinitely



more than worth it.''







My next visit was of a very peculiar sort.  One day



there arrived at the legation Mr. William D. Kelly of



Pennsylvania, anxious, above all things, to have a talk



with Bismarck, especially upon the tariff and the double



monetary standard, both of which were just then burning



questions.  I told Mr. Kelly that it was much easier to



present him to the Emperor than to the chancellor, but that



we would see what could be done.  Thereupon I wrote a



note telling Bismarck who Mr. Kelly was--the senior



member of the House of Representatives by term of service,



the leading champion therein of protection and of the



double standard of value; that he was very anxious to



discuss these subjects with leading German authorities;



and that, knowing the prince's interest in them, it had



seemed to me that he might not be sorry to meet Mr.



Kelly for a brief interview.  To this I received a hearty



response:  ``By all means bring Mr. Kelly over at four



o'clock.''  At four o'clock, then, we appeared at the palace,



and were received immediately and cordially.  When



we were seated the prince said:  ``I am very sorry; but the



new Prussian ministry is to meet here in twenty minutes,



and I must preside over it.''  The meaning of this was



clear, and the conversation began at once, I effacing



myself in order to enjoy it more fully.  In a few seconds they



were in the thick of the tariff question; and, as both were



high protectionists, they got along admirably.  Soon rose



the question of the double standard in coinage; and



on this, too, they agreed.  Notable was the denunciation



by the chancellor of those who differed from him; he



seemed to feel that, as captain of the political forces of



the empire, he was entitled to the allegiance of all honest



members of parliament, and on all questions.  The discussion



ran through various interesting phases, when, noticing



that the members of the Prussian ministry were gathering



in the next room, I rose to go; whereupon the



prince, who seemed greatly interested both in the presentation



of his own views and those of Mr. Kelly, said:  ``No,



no; let them wait.''  The new ministers therefore waited,



the argument on the tariff and the double standard being



more vigorously prosecuted than ever.  After fifteen or



twenty minutes more, I rose again; but Bismarck said: 



``No, no; there's no hurry; let's go and take a walk.'' 



On this we rose and went into the garden.  As we stopped



for an instant to enable him to take down his military cap,



I noticed two large photographs with autographs beneath



them,--one of Lord Beaconsfield, and the other of King



Victor Emmanuel,--and, as I glanced at the latter, I



noticed an inscription beneath it:







          Al mio caro cugino Bismarck.



                       VITTORIO EMANUELE.







Bismarck, seeing me look at it, said:  ``He calls me `cousin'



because he has given me his Order of the Annunciata.'' 



This remark for a moment surprised me.  It was hard for



me to conceive that the greatest man in Europe could care



whether he was entitled to wear the Annunciata ribbon or



not, or whether any king called him ``cousin'' or not.  He



seemed, for a moment, to descend to a somewhat lower



plane than that upon which he had been standing; but, as



we came out into the open and walked up and down the



avenues in the park, he resumed his discussion of greater



things.  During this, he went at considerable length into



the causes which led to the partial demonetization of silver



in the empire; whereupon Mr. Kelly, interrupting him,



said:  ``But, prince, if you fully believed in using both the



precious metals, why did you allow the demonetization of



silver?''  ``Well,'' said Bismarck, ``I had a great many



things to think of in those days, and as everybody said that



Camphausen and ---- were great financiers, and that



they understood all about these questions, I allowed them



to go on; but I soon learned, as our peasants say of those



who try to impose upon their neighbors, that they had



nothing but hot water in their dinner-pots, after all.''  He



then went on discussing the mistakes of those and other



gentlemen before he himself had put his hand to the work



and reversed their policy.  There were curious allusions



to various individuals whose ideas had not suited him,



most of them humorous, but some sarcastic.  At last, after



a walk of about twenty minutes, bearing in mind the



ministers who had been so long waiting for their chief, I



insisted that we must go; whereupon the prince conducted



us to the gate, and most cordially took leave of us.







As we left the place, I said to Mr. Kelly, knowing that



he sometimes wrote letters for publication:  ``Of course, in



whatever you may write to America, you will be careful



not to mention names of persons.''  ``Certainly,'' he said;



``that, of course, I shall never think of doing.''  But alas



for his good resolutions!  In his zeal for protection and



the double standard, all were forgotten.  About a fortnight



later there came back by cable a full statement regarding



his interview, the names all given, and Bismarck's references



to his colleagues brought out vividly.  The result



was that a large portion of the German press was indignant



that Bismarck should have spoken in such a manner



to a foreigner regarding Germans of such eminence,



who had been his trusted colleagues, and who had rendered



to the country very great services; so that, for some



days, the ``Affaire Kelly'' made large demands upon



public attention.  It had hardly subsided when there came



notice to me from the State Department at Washington



that a very eminent American financier was about to be



sent to Berlin; and I was instructed to secure for him an



audience with the chancellor, in order that some arrangements



might be arrived at regarding the double standard



of value.  I must confess that, in view of the ``Affaire



Kelly,'' these instructions chilled me.  Fortunately,



Bismarck was just then taking his usual cure at Kissingen,



during which he always refused to consider any matter of



business; but, on his return to Berlin, I sent him a note



requesting an audience for this special American



representative.  This brought a very kind answer expressing



regret that the chancellor was so pressed with arrears of



business that he desired to be excused; but that the minister



of finance and various other members of the cabinet



had been instructed to receive the American agent and to



communicate with him to the fullest extent.  That was all



very well, but there were my instructions; and I felt



obliged to write again, making a more earnest request. 



Thereupon came an answer that settled the question: the



chancellor regretted that he was too much overwhelmed



with work to meet the gentleman; but said that he would



gladly see the American minister at any time, and must,



for the present, be excused from meeting any unaccredited



persons.







Of course, after that there was nothing to be said; and



the special American agent was obliged to content himself



with what he could obtain in interviews with various



ministers.







Mr. Kelly urged, as his excuse for publishing personal



details in his letters, that it was essential that the whole



world should know just what the great chancellor had said



on so important a subject.  As it turned out, Mr. Kelly's



zeal defeated his purpose; for, had the special agent been



enabled to discuss the matter with the chancellor, there is



little doubt that Germany would have at least endeavored



to establish a permanent double standard of value.







Each year, during my stay, Bismarck gave a dinner to



the diplomatic corps on the Emperor's birthday.  The



table was set then, as now, in the great hall of the



chancellor's palace--the hall in which the Conference of



Berlin was held after the Russo-Turkish War.  The culminating



point of each dinner was near its close, when the



chancellor rose, and, after a brief speech in French,



proposed the health of the heads of all the states there



represented.  This was followed by a toast to the health of



the Emperor, given by the senior member of the diplomatic



corps, and shortly after came an adjournment for



coffee and cigars.  One thing was, at first sight, somewhat



startling; for, as Bismarck arose to propose the toast, the



big black head of a Danish dog appeared upon the table



on either side of him; but the bearing of the dogs was so



solemn that they really detracted nothing from the dignity



of the occasion.







In the smoking-room the guests were wont to gather in



squads, as many of them as possible in the immediate



neighborhood of our host.  During one of these assemblages 



he asked me to explain the great success of Carl



Schurz in America.  My answer was that, before the Lincoln



presidential campaign, in which Schurz took so large



a part, slavery was always discussed either from a constitutional



or a philanthropic point of view, orators seeking to



show either that it was at variance with the fundamental



principles of our government or an offense against humanity;



but that Schurz discussed it in a new way, and mainly



from the philosophic point of view, showing, not merely



its hostility to American ideas of liberty and the wrong



it did to the slaves, but, more especially, the injury it



wrought upon the country at large, and, above all, upon



the slave States themselves; and that, in treating all public



questions, he was philosophic, eloquent, and evidently



sincere.  Bismarck heard what I had to say, and then



answered:  ``As a German, I am proud of Carl Schurz.'' 



This was indeed a confession; for it is certain that, if



Bismarck could have had his way with Carl Schurz in 1848



or 1849, he would have hanged him.







The chancellor's discussions at such times were



frequently of a humorous sort.  He seemed, most of all, to



delight in lively reminiscences of various public men in



Europe.  Nothing could be more cordial and hearty than



his bearing; but that he could take a different tone was



found out by one of my colleagues shortly after my



arrival.  This colleague was Herr von Rudhardt, the



diplomatic and parliamentary representative of Bavaria.  I



remember him well as a large, genial man; and the beauty



and cordial manner of his wife attracted general admiration. 



One day this gentleman made a speech or cast a



vote which displeased Bismarck, and shortly afterward



went to one of the chancellor's parliamentary receptions. 



As he, with his wife leaning on his arm, approached his



host, the latter broke out into a storm of reproaches,



denouncing the minister's conduct, and threatening to



complain of it to his royal master.  Thereupon the diplomatist



simply bowed, made no answer, returned home at once,



and sent his resignation to his government.  All the efforts 



of the Emperor William were unable to appease



him, and he was shortly afterward sent to St. Petersburg



as minister at that court.  But the scene which separated



him from Berlin seemed to give him a fatal shock; he



shortly afterward lost his reason, and at last accounts was



living in an insane asylum.







On another occasion I had an opportunity to see how



the chancellor, so kind in his general dealings with men



whom he liked, could act toward those who crossed his



path.







Being one evening at a reception given by the Duke of



Ratibor, president of the Prussian House of Lords, he



said to me:  ``I saw you this afternoon in the diplomatic



box.  Our proceedings must have seemed very stupid.''  I



answered that they had interested me much.  On this he



put his lips to my ear and whispered:  ``Come to-morrow



at the same hour, and you will hear something of real



interest.''  Of course, when the time arrived, I was in my



seat, wondering what the matter of interest could be. 



Soon I began to suspect that the duke had made some mistake,



for business seemed following the ordinary routine;



but presently a bill was brought in by one of the leading



Prussian ministers, a member of one of the most eminent



families in Germany, a man of the most attractive manners,



and greatly in favor with the Emperor William and



the crown prince, afterward the Emperor Frederick.  The



bill was understood to give a slight extension of suffrage



in the choice of certain leading elected officials.  The question



being asked by some one on the floor whether the head



of the ministry, Prince Bismarck, approved the bill, this



leading minister, who had introduced it, answered in the



affirmative, and said that, though Prince Bismarck had



been kept away by illness from the sessions in which it had



been discussed, he had again and again shown that he was



not opposed to it, and there could be no question on the



subject.  At this a member rose and solemnly denied the



correctness of this statement; declared that he was in



possession of information to the very opposite effect; and



then read a paper, claiming to emanate directly from the



chancellor himself, to the effect that he had nothing whatever



to do with the bill and disapproved it.  Upon Bismarck's



colleagues in the ministry, who thought that his



silence had given consent, this came like a thunderbolt;



and those who had especially advocated the measure saw



at once that they had fallen into a trap.  The general



opinion was that the illness of the chancellor had been a



stratagem; that his sudden disclaimer, after his leading



colleagues had thus committed themselves, was intended to



drive them from the ministry; and that he was determined



to prevent the minister who had most strongly



supported the bill from securing popularity by it.  This



minister, then, and the other members of the cabinet at



once resigned, giving place to men whom the chancellor



did not consider so likely to run counter to his ideas and



interests.







Indeed, it must be confessed that the great statesman



not infrequently showed the defects of his qualities.  As



one out of many cases may be cited his treatment of Eduard



Lasker.  This statesman during several years rendered



really important services.  Though an Israelite, he



showed none of the grasping propensities so often ascribed



to his race.  He seemed to care nothing for wealth or



show, lived very simply, and devoted himself to the public



good as he understood it.  Many capitalists, bankers, and



promoters involved in the financial scandals which followed



the Franco-Prussian War were of his race; but this



made no difference with him: in his great onslaught on the



colossal scoundrelism of that time, he attacked Jew and



Gentile alike; and he deserved well of his country for



aiding to cleanse it of all that fraud and folly.  On a



multitude of other questions, too, he had been very serviceable



to the nation and to Bismarck; but, toward the end of his



career, he had, from time to time, opposed some of the



chancellor's measures, and this seemed to turn the latter



completely against him.







At the opening of the Northern Pacific Railway, Lasker



was one of the invited guests, but soon showed himself



desperately ill; and, one day, walking along a street in



New York, suddenly dropped dead.







A great funeral was given him; and, of all the ceremonies



I have ever seen, this was one of the most remarkable



for its simplicity and beauty.  Mr. Carl Schurz and myself



were appointed to make addresses on the occasion in the



temple of the Israelites on Fifth Avenue; and we agreed



in thinking that we had never seen a ceremony of the kind



more appropriate to a great statesman.







At the next session of Congress, a resolution was



introduced condoling with the government of Germany on the



loss of so distinguished a public servant.  This resolution



was passed unanimously, and in perfect good faith, every



person present--and, indeed, every citizen in the whole



country who gave the matter any thought--supposing that



it would be welcomed by the German Government as a



friendly act.







But the result was astounding.  Bismarck took it upon



himself, when the resolution reached him, to treat it with



the utmost contempt, and to send it back without really



laying it before his government, thus giving the American



people to understand that they had interfered in a matter



which did not concern them.  For a time, this seemed



likely to provoke a bitter outbreak of American feeling;



but, fortunately, the whole matter was allowed to drift by.







Among the striking characteristics of Bismarck was his



evident antipathy to ceremonial.  He was never present



at any of the great court functions save the first reception



given at the golden wedding of the Emperor William



I, and at the gala opera a few evenings afterward.







The reason generally assigned for this abstention was



that the chancellor, owing to his increasing weight and



weakness, could not remain long on his feet, as people are



expected to do on such occasions.  Nor do I remember



seeing him at any of the festivities attending the marriage



of the present Emperor William, who was then merely



the son of the crown prince.  One reason for his absence,



perhaps, was his reluctance to take part in the Fackeltanz,



a most curious survival.  In this ceremony, the ministers



of Prussia, in full gala dress, with flaring torches in their



hands, precede the bride or the groom, as the case may be,



as he or she solemnly marches around the great white hall



of the palace, again and again, to the sound of solemn



music.  The bride first goes to the foot of the throne, and



is welcomed by the Emperor, who gravely leads her once



around the hall, and then takes his seat.  The groom then



approaches the throne, and invites the Empress to march



solemnly around the room with him in the same manner,



and she complies with his request.  Then the bride takes



the royal prince next in importance, who, in this particular



case, happened to be the Prince of Wales, at present King



Edward VII; the groom, the next princess; and so on, until



each of the special envoys from the various monarchs of



Europe has gone through this solemn function.  So it is



that the ministers, some of them nearly eighty years of



age, march around the room perhaps a score of times; and



it is very easy to understand that Bismarck preferred to



avoid such an ordeal.







From time to time, the town, and even the empire, was



aroused by news that he was in a fit of illness or ill



nature, and insisting on resigning.  On such occasions



the old Emperor generally drove to the chancellor's palace



in the Wilhelmstrasse, and, in his large, kindly, hearty



way, got the great man out of bed, put him in good humor,



and set him going again.  On one of these occasions,



happening to meet Rudolf von Gneist, who had been, during a



part of Bismarck's career, on very confidential terms with



him, I asked what the real trouble was.  ``Oh,'' said Gneist,



``he has eaten too many plover's eggs (Ach, er hat zu viel



Kibitzeier gegessen).''  This had reference to the fact



that certain admirers of the chancellor in the neighborhood



of the North Sea were accustomed to send him, each



year, a large basket of plovers' eggs, of which he was very



fond; and this diet has never been considered favorable



to digestion.







This reminds me that Gneist on one occasion told me



another story, which throws some light on the chancellor's



habits.  Gneist had especial claims on Americans.  As the



most important professor of Roman law at the university



he had welcomed a long succession of American students;



as a member of the imperial parliament, of the Prussian



legislature, and of the Berlin town council, he had shown



many kindnesses to American travelers; and as the



representative of the Emperor William in the arbitration



between the United States and Great Britain on our north-



western boundary, he had proved a just judge, deciding in



our favor.  Therefore it was that, on the occasion of one of



the great Thanksgiving dinners celebrated by the American



colony, he was present as one of the principal guests. 



Near him was placed a bottle of Hermitage, rather a heavy,



heady wine.  Shortly after taking his seat, he said to me



with a significant smile, ``That is some of the wine I sent



to Bismarck, and it did not turn out well.''  ``How was



that?'' I asked.  ``Well,'' he said, ``one day I met



Bismarck and asked him about his health.  He answered, `It



is wretched; I can neither eat nor sleep.'  I replied, `Let



me send you something that will help you.  I have just



received a lot of Hermitage, and will send you a dozen



bottles.  If you take a COUPLE OF GLASSES each day with



your dinner, it will be the best possible tonic, and will



do you great good.'  Sometime afterward,'' continued



Gneist, ``I met him again, and asked how the wine agreed



with him.  `Oh,' said Bismarck, `not at all; it made me



worse than ever.'  `Why,' said I, `how did you take it?' 



`Just as you told me,' replied Bismarck, `A COUPLE OF



BOTTLES each day with my dinner.' ''







Bismarck's constant struggle against the diseases which



beset him became pathetic.  He once asked me how I managed



to sleep in Berlin; and on my answering him he



said--``Well, I can never sleep in Berlin at night when it



is quiet; but as soon as the noise begins, about four o'clock



in the morning, I can sleep a little and get my rest for



the day.''







It was frequently made clear that the Emperor William



and the German officials were not the only ones to experience



the results of Bismarck's ill health: the diplomatic



corps, and among them myself, had sometimes to take it



into account.







Bismarck was especially kind to Americans, and, above



all, to the American diplomatic representatives.  To this



there was but one exception, my immediate successor, and



that was a case in which no fault need be imputed to



either side.  That Bismarck's feeling toward Americans



generally was good is abundantly proven, and especially



by such witnesses as Abeken, Sidney Whitman, and Moritz



Busch, the last of whom has shown that, while the chancellor



was very bitter against sundry German princes who



lingered about the army and lived in Versailles at the



public expense, he seemed always to rejoice in the presence



of General Sheridan and other compatriots of ours who



were attached to the German headquarters by a tie of



much less strength.







But, as I have already hinted, there was one thing which



was especially vexatious to him; and this was the evasion,



as he considered it, of duty to the German Fatherland



by sundry German-Americans.  One day I received a letter



from a young man who stated his case as follows: 



He had left his native town in Alsace-Lorraine just



before arriving at the military age; had gone to the United



States; had remained there, not long enough to learn        



English, but just long enough to obtain naturalization; and



had then lost no time in returning to his native town.  He



had been immediately thrown into prison; and thence he



wrote me, expressing his devotion to the American flag,



his pride in his American citizenship,--and his desire to



live in Germany.  I immediately wrote to the minister of



foreign affairs, stating the man's case, and showing that



it came under the Bancroft treaties, or at least under the



construction of them which the German Government up to



that time had freely allowed.  To this I received an



answer that the Bancroft treaties, having been made before



Alsace-Lorraine was annexed to the empire, did not apply



to these new provinces, and that the youth was detained as



a deserter.  To this I replied that, although the minister's



statement was strictly true, the point had been waived



long before in our favor; that in no less than eight cases



the German Government had extended the benefit of the



Bancroft treaties over Alsace-Lorraine; and that in one



of these cases the acting minister of foreign affairs had



declared the intention of the government to make this



extension permanent.







But just at this period, after the death of Baron von



B<u:>low, who had been most kindly in all such matters, the



chancellor had fallen into a curious way of summoning



eminent German diplomatists from various capitals of



Europe into the ministry of foreign affairs for a limited



time--trying them on, as it were.  These gentlemen were



generally very agreeable; but on this occasion I had to



deal with one who had been summoned from service at



one of the lesser German courts, and who was younger



than most of his predecessors.  To my surprise, he brushed



aside all the precedents I had cited, and also the fact that



a former acting minister of foreign affairs had distinctly



stated that, as a matter of comity, the German Government



proposed to consider the Bancroft treaties as applying



permanently to Alsace-Lorraine.  Neither notes nor verbal



remonstrances moved him.  He was perfectly civil, and



answered my arguments, in every case, as if he were about



to yield, yet always closed with a ``but''--and did nothing. 



He seemed paralyzed.  The cause of the difficulty was soon



evident.  It was natural that Bismarck should have a feeling



that a young man who had virtually deserted the German



flag just before reaching the military age deserved the



worst treatment which the law allowed.  His own sons had



served in the army, and had plunged into the thickest of



the fight, one of them receiving a serious wound; and that



this young Alsatian Israelite should thus escape service



by a trick was evidently hateful to him.  That the chancellor



himself gave the final decision in this matter was the



only explanation of the fact that this particular acting



minister of foreign affairs never gave me an immediate



answer.







The matter became more and more serious.  The letter



of the law was indeed on Bismarck's side; but the young



man was an American citizen, and the idea of an American



citizen being held in prison was anything but pleasant to



me, and I knew that it would be anything but pleasant



to my fellow-citizens across the water.  I thought on the



proud words, ``civis Romanus sum,'' and of the analogy



involved in this case.  My position was especially difficult,



because I dared not communicate the case fully to the



American State Department of that period.  Various private



despatches had got out into the world and made



trouble for their authors, and even so eminent a



diplomatist as Mr. George P. Marsh at Rome came very near



being upset by one.  My predecessor, Bayard Taylor, was



very nearly wrecked by another; and it was the escape



and publication of a private despatch which plunged my



immediate successor into his quarrel with Bismarck, and



made his further stay in Germany useless: I therefore



stopped short with my first notification to the State



Department--to the effect that a naturalized American had



been imprisoned for desertion in Alsace-Lorraine, and



that the legation was doing its best to secure his release. 



To say more than this involved danger that the affair



might fall into the hands of sensation-mongers, and result



in howls and threats against the German Government and



Bismarck; and I knew well that, if such howls and threats



were made, Bismarck would never let this young Israelite



out of prison as long as he lived.







It seemed hardly the proper thing, serious as the case



was, to ask for my passports.  It was certain that, if this



were done, there would come a chorus of blame from both



sides of the Atlantic.  Deciding, therefore, to imitate the



example of the old man in the school-book, who, before



throwing stones at the boy in his fruit-tree, threw turf



and grass, I secured from Washington by cable a leave



of absence, but, before starting, saw some of my diplomatic



colleagues, who were wont to circulate freely and



talk much, stated the main features of the case to them,



and said that I was ``going off to enjoy myself''; that



there seemed little use for an American minister in a



country where precedents and agreements were so easily



disregarded.  Next day I started for the French Riviera. 



The journey was taken leisurely, with interesting halts



at Cologne and Aix-la-Chapelle; and, as I reached the



hotel in Paris, a telegram was handed me--``Your man



in Alsace-Lorraine is free.''  It was evident that the



chancellor had felt better and had thought more leniently



of the matter, and I had never another difficulty of the sort



during the remainder of my stay.







The whole weight of testimony as regards Bismarck's



occasional severity is to the effect that, stern and



persistent as he was, he had much tenderness of heart; but



as to the impossibility of any nation, government, or press



scaring or driving him, I noticed curious evidences during



my stay.  It was well known that he was not unfriendly



to Russia; indeed, he more than once made declarations



which led some of the Western powers to think him too



ready to make concessions to Russian policy in the East;



but his relations to Prince Gortchakoff, the former Russian



chancellor, were not of the best; and after the Berlin



Conference the disappointment of Russia led to various



unfriendly actions by Russian authorities and individuals



of all sorts, from the Czar down.  There was a general



feeling that it was dangerous for Germany to resent



this, and a statesman of another mold would have deprecated



these attacks, or sought to mitigate them.  Not so



Bismarck: he determined to give as good as was sent;



and, for a very considerable time he lost no chance to show



that the day of truckling by Germany to her powerful



neighbor was past.  This became at last so marked that



bitter, and even defiant, presentation of unpalatable



truths regarding Russia, in the press inspired from the



chancery, seemed the usual form in which all Russian



statesmen, and especially members of the imperial house,



were welcomed in Berlin.  One morning, taking up my



copy of the paper most directly inspired by the chancellor,



I found an article on the shortcomings of Russia,



especially pungent--almost vitriolic.  It at once occurred



to me to look among the distinguished arrivals to see



what Muscovite was in town; and my search was rewarded



by the discovery that the heir to the imperial crown,



afterward Alexander III, had just arrived and was staying



a day or two in the city.







When Bismarck uttered his famous saying, ``We Germans



fear God and naught beside,'' he simply projected



into the history of Germany his own character.  Fearlessness



was a main characteristic of his from boyhood,



and it never left him in any of the emergencies of his



later life.







His activity through the press interested me much at



times.  It was not difficult to discern his work in many of



the ``inspired'' editorials and other articles.  I have in



my possession sundry examples of the originals of these,



--each page is divided into two columns,--the first the



work of one of his chosen scribes, the second copiously



amended in the chancellor's own hand, and always with



a gain in lucidity and pungency.







Of the various matters which arose between us, one is



perhaps worthy of mention, since it has recently given



rise to a controversy between a German-American journalist



and Bismarck's principal biographer.







One morning, as I sat in dismay before my work-table,



loaded with despatches, notes, and letters, besides futilities



of every sort, there came in the card of Lothar



Bucher.  Everything else was, of course, thrown aside. 



Bucher never made social visits.  He was the pilot-fish of



the whale, and a visit from him ``meant business.''







Hardly had he entered the room when his business was



presented: the chancellor wished to know if the United



States would join Germany and Great Britain in representations



calculated to stop the injuries to the commerce



of all three nations caused by the war then going on



between Chile and Peru.







My answer was that the United States could not join



other powers in any such effort; that our government



might think it best to take separate action; and that it



would not interfere with any proper efforts of other



powers to secure simple redress for actual grievances; but that



it could not make common cause with other powers in any



such efforts.  To clinch this, I cited the famous passage



in Washington's Farewell Address against ``entangling



alliances with foreign powers'' as American gospel, and



added that my government would also be unalterably



opposed to anything leading to permanent occupation of



South American territory by any European power, and



for this referred him to the despatches of John Quincy



Adams and the declarations of President Monroe.







He seemed almost dumfounded at this, and to this day



I am unable to decide whether his surprise was real or



affected.  He seemed to think it impossible that we could



take any such ground, or that such a remote, sentimental



interest could outweigh material interests so pressing as



those involved in the monkey-and-parrot sort of war going



on between the two South American republics.  As he was



evidently inclined to dwell on what appeared to him the



strangeness of my answer, I said to him:  ``What I state



to you is elementary in American foreign policy; and to



prove this I will write, in your presence, a cable despatch



to the Secretary of State at Washington, and you shall see



it and the answer it brings.''







I then took a cable blank, wrote the despatch, and



showed it to him.  It was a simple statement of the



chancellor's proposal, and on that he left me.  In the



evening came the answer.  It was virtually my statement to



Bucher, and I sent it to him just as I had received it. 



That was the last of the matter.  No further effort was



made in the premises, so far as I ever heard, either by



Germany or Great Britain.  It has recently been stated,



in an American magazine article, that Bismarck, toward



the end of his life, characterized the position taken by



Mr. Cleveland regarding European acquisition of South



American territory as something utterly new and unheard



of.  To this, Poschinger, the eminent Bismarck biographer,



has replied in a way which increases my admiration



for the German Foreign Office; for it would appear that



he found in the archives of that department a most exact



statement of the conversation between Bucher and myself,



and of the action which followed it.  So precise was his



account that it even recalled phrases and other minutiae



of the conversation which I had forgotten, but which I at



once recognized as exact when thus reminded of them. 



The existence of such a record really revives one's child-



like faith in the opening of the Great Book of human deeds



and utterances at ``the last day.''







Perhaps the most interesting phase of Bismarck's life



which a stranger could observe was his activity in the



imperial parliament.







That body sits in a large hall, the representatives of the



people at large occupying seats in front of the president's



desk, and the delegates from the various states--known



as the Imperial Council--being seated upon an elevated



platform at the side of the room, right and left of the



president's chair.  At the right of the president, some



distance removed, sits the chancellor, and at his right hand



the imperial ministry; while in front of the president's



chair, on a lower stage of the platform, is the tribune from



which, as a rule, members of the lower house address the



whole body.







It was my good fortune to hear Bismarck publicly



discuss many important questions, and his way of speaking



was not like that of any other man I have ever heard.  He



was always clothed in the undress uniform of a Prussian



general; and, as he rose, his bulk made him imposing. 



His first utterances were disappointing.  He seemed



wheezy, rambling, incoherent, with a sort of burdensome



self-consciousness checking his ideas and clogging his



words.  His manner was fidgety, his arms being thrown



uneasily about, and his fingers fumbling his mustache



or his clothing or the papers on his desk.  He puffed,



snorted, and floundered; seemed to make assertions without



proof and phrases without point; when suddenly he



would utter a statement so pregnant as to clear up a whole



policy, or a sentence so audacious as to paralyze a whole



line of his opponents, or a phrase so vivid as to run



through the nation and electrify it.  Then, perhaps after



more rumbling and rambling, came a clean, clear, historical



illustration carrying conviction; then, very likely, a



simple and strong argument, not infrequently ended by



some heavy missile in the shape of an accusation or taunt



hurled into the faces of his adversaries; then, perhaps at



considerable length, a mixture of caustic criticism and



personal reminiscence, in which sparkled those wonderful



sayings which have gone through the empire and settled



deeply into the German heart.  I have known many clever



speakers and some very powerful orators; but I have



never known one capable, in the same degree, of



overwhelming his enemies and carrying his whole country with



him.  Nor was his eloquence in his oratory alone.  There



was something in his bearing, as he sat at his ministerial



desk and at times looked up from it to listen to a speaker,



which was very impressive.







Twice I heard Moltke speak, and each time on the army



estimates.  Nothing could be more simple and straight-



forward than the great soldier's manner.  As he rose, he



looked like a tall, thin, kindly New England schoolmaster. 



His seat was among the representatives, very nearly in



front of that which Bismarck occupied on the estrade.  On



one of these occasions I heard him make his famous



declaration that for the next fifty years Germany must be in



constant readiness for an attack from France.  He spoke



very rarely, was always brief and to the point, saying with



calm strength just what he thought it a duty to say--neither



more nor less.  So Caesar might have spoken.  Bismarck,



I observed, always laid down his large pencil and



listened intently to every word.







The most curious example of the eloquence of silence in



Bismarck's case, which I noted, was when his strongest



opponent, Windthorst, as the representative of the



combination of Roman Catholics and others generally in



opposition, but who, at that particular time, seemed to have



made a sort of agreement to support some of Bismarck's



measures, went to the tribune and began a long and very



earnest speech.  Windthorst was a man of diminutive



stature, smaller even than Thiers,--almost a dwarf,--and



his first words on this occasion had a comical effect.  He



said, in substance, ``I am told that if we enter into a



combination with the chancellor in this matter, we are



sure to come out second best.''  At this Bismarck raised



his head, turned and looked at the orator, the attention of



the whole audience being fastened upon both.  ``But,''



continued Windthorst, ``the chancellor will have to get



up very early in the morning to outwit us in this matter.'' 



There was a general outburst of laughter as the two



leaders eyed each other.  It reminded one of nothing so



much as a sturdy mastiff contemplating a snappish terrier.







As to his relations with his family, which, to some little



extent, I noticed when with them, nothing could be more



hearty, simple, and kindly.  He was beautifully devoted



to his wife, and evidently gloried in his two stalwart sons,



Prince Herbert and ``Count Bill,'' and in his daughter,



Countess von Rantzau; and they, in return, showed a



devotion to him not less touching.  No matter how severe



the conflicts which raged outside, within his family the



stern chancellor of ``blood and iron'' seemed to disappear;



and in his place came the kindly, genial husband, father,



and host.







The last time I ever saw him was at the Sch<o:>nhausen



station on my way to Bremen.  He walked slowly from the



train to his carriage, leaning heavily on his stick.  He



seemed not likely to last long; but Dr. Schweninger's



treatment gave him a new lease of life, so that, on my



return to Berlin eighteen years later, he was still living. 



In reply to a respectful message he sent me a kindly



greeting, and expressed the hope that he would, ere long,



be well enough to receive me; but he was even then sinking,



and soon passed away.  So was lost to mortal sight



the greatest German since Luther.

PART IV







AS UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT















CHAPTER XVII







EVOLUTION OF ``THE CORNELL IDEA''--1850-1865







To Trinity Hall at Hobart College may be assigned



whatever honor that shadowy personage, the future



historian, shall think due the place where was conceived



and quickened the germ idea of Cornell University.  In



that little stone barrack on the shore of Seneca Lake, rude



in its architecture but lovely in its surroundings, a room



was assigned me during my first year at college; and in



a neighboring apartment, with charming views over the



lake and distant hills, was the library of the Hermean



Society.  It was the largest collection of books I had ever



seen,--four thousand volumes,--embracing a mass of



literature from ``The Pirate's Own Book'' to the works of



Lord Bacon.  In this paradise I reveled, browsing through



it at my will.  This privilege was of questionable value,



since it drew me somewhat from closer study; but it was



not without its uses.  One day I discovered in it Huber and



Newman's book on the English universities.  What a new



world it opened!  My mind was sensitive to any impression



it might make, on two accounts: first, because, on the



intellectual side, I was woefully disappointed at the



inadequacy of the little college as regarded its teaching force



and equipment; and next, because, on the esthetic side, I



lamented the absence of everything like beauty or fitness in



its architecture.







As I read in this new-found book of the colleges at



Oxford and Cambridge, and pored over the engraved



views of quadrangles, halls, libraries, chapels,--of all the



noble and dignified belongings of a great seat of learning,



--my heart sank within me.  Every feature of the little



American college seemed all the more sordid.  But gradually



I began consoling myself by building air-castles. 



These took the form of structures suited to a great



university:--with distinguished professors in every field, with



libraries as rich as the Bodleian, halls as lordly as that of



Christ Church or of Trinity, chapels as inspiring as that



of King's, towers as dignified as those of Magdalen and



Merton, quadrangles as beautiful as those of Jesus and



St. John's.  In the midst of all other occupations I was



constantly rearing these structures on that queenly site



above the finest of the New York lakes, and dreaming of



a university worthy of the commonwealth and of the nation. 



This dream became a sort of obsession.  It came



upon me during my working hours, in the class-rooms, in



rambles along the lake shore, in the evenings, when I paced



up and down the walks in front of the college buildings,



and saw rising in their place and extending to the



pretty knoll behind them, the worthy home of a great



university.  But this university, though beautiful and



dignified, like those at Oxford and Cambridge, was in two



important respects very unlike them.  First, I made



provision for other studies beside classics and mathematics. 



There should be professors in the great modern



literatures--above all, in our own; there should also be a



professor of modern history and a lecturer on architecture. 



And next, my university should be under control of



no single religious organization; it should be free from all



sectarian or party trammels; in electing its trustees and



professors no questions should be asked as to their belief



or their attachment to this or that sect or party.  So far, at



least, I went in those days along the road toward the



founding of Cornell.







The academic year of 1849-1850 having been passed at



this little college in western New York, I entered Yale. 



This was nearer my ideal; for its professors were more



distinguished, its equipment more adequate, its students



more numerous, its general scope more extended.  But it



was still far below my dreams.  Its single course in classics



and mathematics, through which all students were



forced alike, regardless of their tastes, powers, or aims;



its substitution of gerund-grinding for ancient literature;



its want of all instruction in modern literature; its



substitution of recitals from text-books for instruction in



history--all this was far short of my ideal.  Moreover,



Yale was then far more under denominational control



than at present--its president, of necessity, as was then



supposed, a Congregational minister; its professors, as a



rule, members of the same sect; and its tutors, to whom



our instruction during the first two years was almost



entirely confined, students in the Congregational Divinity.







Then, too, its outward representation was sordid and



poor.  The long line of brick barracks, the cheapest which



could be built for money, repelled me.  What a contrast



to Oxford and Cambridge, and, above all, to my air-



castles!  There were, indeed, two architectural consolations:



one, the library building, which had been built just



before my arrival; and the other, the Alumni Hall, begun



shortly afterward.  These were of stone, and I snatched



an especial joy from the grotesque Gothic heads in the



cornices of the library towers and from the little latticed



windows at the rear of the Alumni Hall.  Both seemed to



me features worthy of ``colleges and halls of ancient



days.''







The redeeming feature of the whole was its setting,



the ``green,'' with superb avenues overarched by elms;



and a further charm was added by East and West Rock,



and by the views over New Haven Harbor into Long



Island Sound.  Among these scenes I erected new air-



castles.  First of all, a great quadrangle, not unlike that



which is now developing at Yale, and, as a leading



feature, a gate-tower like that since erected in memory



of William Walter Phelps, but, unlike that, adorned



with statues in niches and on corbels, like those on the



entrance tower of Trinity at Cambridge--statues of old



Yalensian worthies, such as Elihu Yale in his costume of



the Georgian period, Bishop Berkeley in his robes,



President Dwight in his Geneva gown, and Nathan Hale in



fetters.  There was also in my dream another special



feature, which no one has as yet attempted to realize--a lofty



campanile, which I placed sometimes at the intersection of



College and Church, and sometimes at the intersection of



College and Elm streets--a clock-tower looking proudly



down the slope, over the traffic of the town, and bearing a



deep-toned peal of bells.







My general ideas on the subject were further developed



by Charles Astor Bristed's book, ``Five Years in an



English University,'' and by sundry publications regarding



student life in Germany.  Still, my opinions regarding



education were wretchedly imperfect, as may be judged



from one circumstance.  The newly established Sheffield



Scientific School had just begun its career in the old



president's house in front of the former Divinity Hall on



the college green; and, one day in my senior year, looking



toward it from my window in North College, I saw a



student examining a colored liquid in a test-tube.  A feeling



of wonder came over me!  What could it all be about? 



Probably not a man of us in the whole senior class had



any idea of a chemical laboratory save as a sort of small



kitchen back of a lecture-desk, like that in which an assistant



and a colored servant prepared oxygen, hydrogen, and



carbonic acid for the lectures of Professor Silliman.  I



was told that this new laboratory was intended for experiment,



and my wonder was succeeded by disgust that any



human being should give his time to pursuits so futile.







The next period in the formation of my ideas regarding



a university began, after my graduation at Yale, during



my first visit to Oxford.  Then and at later visits, both to



Oxford and Cambridge, I not only reveled in the architectural



glories of those great seats of learning, but learned



the advantages of college life in common--of the ``halls,''



and the general social life which they promote; of 



the ``commons'' and ``combination rooms,'' which give a



still closer relation between those most directly concerned



in university work; of the quadrangles, which give a sense



of scholarly seclusion, even in the midst of crowded cities;



and of all the surroundings which give a dignity befitting



these vast establishments.  Still more marked progress in



my ideas was made during my attendance at the Sorbonne



and the Coll<e!>ge de France.  In those institutions, during



the years 1853-1854, I became acquainted with the French



university-lecture system, with its clearness, breadth,



wealth of illustration, and its hold upon large audiences



of students; and I was seized with the desire to transfer



something like it to our own country.  My castles in the



air were now reared more loftily and broadly; for they



began to include laboratories, museums, and even galleries



of art.







Even St. Petersburg, during my attach<e'>ship in 1854-



1855, contributed to these airy structures.  In my diary



for that period, I find it jotted down that I observed and



studied at various times the Michael Palace in that city as



a very suitable structure for a university.  Twenty years



afterward, when I visited, as minister of the United



States, the Grand Duchess Catherine, the aunt of the



Emperor Alexander III, in that same palace, and mentioned



to her my old admiration for it, she gave me a most



interesting account of the building of it, and of the laying



out of the beautiful park about it by her father, the old



Grand Duke Michael, and agreed with me that it would



be a noble home for an institution of learning.







My student life at Berlin, during the year following,



further intensified my desire to do something for university



education in the United States.  There I saw my ideal



of a university not only realized, but extended and glorified--



with renowned professors, with ample lecture-halls,



with everything possible in the way of illustrative



materials, with laboratories, museums, and a concourse of



youth from all parts of the world.







I have already spoken, in the chapter on my professorship 



at the University of Michigan, regarding the influence



on my ideas of its president, Henry Philip Tappan, and



of the whole work in that institution.  Though many good



things may be justly said for the University of Virginia,



the real beginning of a university in the United States, in



the modern sense, was made by Dr. Tappan and his



colleagues at Ann Arbor.  Its only defects seemed to me that



it included no technical side, and did not yet admit



women.  As to the first of these defects, the State had



separated the agricultural college from the university,



placing it in what, at that period, was a remote swamp



near the State Capitol, and had as yet done nothing toward



providing for other technical branches.  As to the second,



though a few of us favored the admission of women, President



Tappan opposed it; and, probably, in view of the



condition of the university and of public opinion at that



time, his opposition was wise.







Recalled to Syracuse after five years in Michigan, my



old desire to see a university rising in the State of New



York was stronger than ever.  Michigan had shown me



some of my ideals made real; why might not our own



much greater commonwealth be similarly blessed?







The first thing was to devise a plan for a suitable



faculty.  As I felt that this must not demand too large an



outlay, I drew up a scheme providing for a few resident



teachers supported by endowments, and for a body of nonresident



professors or lecturers supported by fees.  These



lecturers were to be chosen from the most eminent professors



in the existing colleges and from the best men then



in the public-lecture field; and my confidant in the matter



was George William Curtis, who entered into it heartily,



and who afterward, in his speech at my inauguration as



president of Cornell, referred to it in a way which touched



me deeply.[5]











[5] See Mr. Curtis's speech, September 8, 1868, published



by the university.











The next thing was to decide upon a site.  It must



naturally be in the central part of the State; and, rather



curiously, that which I then most coveted, frequently



visited, walked about, and inspected was the rising ground



southeast of Syracuse since selected by the Methodists



for their institution which takes its name from that city.







My next effort was to make a beginning of an endowment,



and for this purpose I sought to convert Gerrit Smith. 



He was, for those days, enormously wealthy.  His property,



which was estimated at from two to three millions



of dollars, he used munificently; and his dear friend and



mine, Samuel Joseph May, had told me that it was not too



much to hope that Mr. Smith might do something for the



improvement of higher instruction.  To him, therefore, I



wrote, proposing that if he would contribute an equal sum



to a university at Syracuse, I would give to it one half of



my own property.  In his answer he gave reasons why he



could not join in the plan, and my scheme seemed no



nearer reality than my former air-castles.  It seemed,



indeed, to have faded away like







     ``The baseless fabric of a vision''







and to have left







     ``Not a wrack behind''--







when all its main features were made real in a way and by



means utterly unexpected; for now began the train of



events which led to my acquaintance, friendship, and close



alliance with the man through whom my plans became a



reality, larger and better than any ever seen in my dreams



--Ezra Cornell.















CHAPTER XVIII







EZRA CORNELL--1864-1874











On the first day of the year 1864, taking my seat for



the first time in the State Senate at Albany, I found



among my associates a tall, spare man, apparently very



reserved and austere, and soon learned his name--Ezra



Cornell.







Though his chair was near mine, there was at first little



intercourse between us, and there seemed small chance of



more.  He was steadily occupied, and seemed to have no



desire for new acquaintances.  He was, perhaps, the oldest



man in the Senate; I, the youngest: he was a man of



business; I was fresh from a university professorship:



and, upon the announcement of committees, our paths



seemed separated entirely; for he was made chairman of



the committee on agriculture, while to me fell the



chairmanship of the committee on education.







Yet it was this last difference which drew us together;



for among the first things referred to my committee was a



bill to incorporate a public library which he proposed to



found in Ithaca.







On reading this bill I was struck, not merely by his



gift of one hundred thousand dollars to his townsmen,



but even more by a certain breadth and largeness in his



way of making it.  The most striking sign of this was his



mode of forming a board of trustees; for, instead of the



usual effort to tie up the organization forever in some sect,



party, or clique, he had named the best men of his town--



his political opponents as well as his friends; and had



added to them the pastors of all the principal churches,



Catholic and Protestant.  This breadth of mind, even



more than his munificence, drew me to him.  We met several



times, discussed his bill, and finally I reported it



substantially as introduced, and supported it until it



became a law.







Our next relations were not, at first, so pleasant.  The



great Land Grant of 1862, from the General Government



to the State, for industrial and technical education, had



been turned over, at a previous session of the legislature,



to an institution called the People's College, in



Schuyler County; but the Agricultural College, twenty



miles distant from it, was seeking to take away from it



a portion of this endowment; and among the trustees of



this Agricultural College was Mr. Cornell, who now



introduced a bill to divide the fund between the two



institutions.







On this I at once took ground against him, declaring



that the fund ought to be kept together at some one



institution; that on no account should it be divided; that the



policy for higher education in the State of New York



should be concentration; that we had already suffered



sufficiently from scattering our resources; that there were



already over twenty colleges in the State, and not one of



them doing anything which could justly be called university



work.







Mr. Cornell's first effort was to have his bill referred,



not to my committee, but to his; here I resisted him, and,



as a solution of the difficulty, it was finally referred to a



joint committee made up of both.  On this double-headed



committee I deliberately thwarted his purpose throughout



the entire session, delaying action and preventing any



report upon his bill.







Most men would have been vexed by this; but he took



my course calmly, and even kindly.  He never expostulated,



and always listened attentively to my arguments



against his view; meanwhile I omitted no opportunity to



make these arguments as strong as possible, and especially



to impress upon him the importance of keeping the fund



together.







After the close of the session, during the following



summer, as it had become evident that the trustees of the



People's College had no intention of raising the additional



endowment and providing the equipment required by the



act which gave them the land grant, there was great danger



that the whole fund might be lost to the State by the



lapsing of the time allowed in the congressional act for



its acceptance.  Just at this period Mr. Cornell invited me



to attend a meeting of the State Agricultural Society, of



which he was the president, at Rochester; and, when the



meeting had assembled, he quietly proposed to remove the



difficulty I had raised, by drawing a new bill giving the



State Agricultural College half of the fund, and by inserting



a clause requiring the college to provide an additional



sum of three hundred thousand dollars.  This sum he



pledged himself to give, and, as the comptroller of the



State had estimated the value of the land grant at six



hundred thousand dollars, Mr. Cornell supposed that this



would obviate my objection, since the fund of the Agricultural



College would thus be made equal to the whole original



land-grant fund as estimated, which would be equivalent



to keeping the whole fund together.







The entire audience applauded, as well they might: it



was a noble proposal.  But, much to the disgust of the



meeting, I persisted in my refusal to sanction any bill



dividing the fund, declared myself now more opposed to



such a division than ever; but promised that if Mr. Cornell



and his friends would ask for the WHOLE grant--keeping



it together, and adding his three hundred thousand dollars,



as proposed--I would support such a bill with all my



might.







I was led to make this proposal by a course of



circumstances which might, perhaps, be called ``providential.'' 



For some years I had been dreaming of a university; had



looked into the questions involved, at home and abroad;



had approached sundry wealthy and influential men on the



subject; but had obtained no encouragement, until this



strange and unexpected combination of circumstances--a



great land grant, the use of which was to be determined



largely by the committee of which I was chairman, and



this noble pledge by Mr. Cornell.







Yet for some months nothing seemed to come of our



conference.  At the assembling of the legislature in the



following year, it was more evident than ever that the



trustees of the People's College intended to do nothing. 



During the previous session they had promised through



their agents to supply the endowment required by their



charter; but, though this charter obliged them, as a condition



of taking the grant, to have an estate of two hundred



acres, buildings for the accommodation of two hundred



students, and a faculty of not less than six professors, with



a sufficient library and other apparatus, yet our committee,



on again taking up the subject, found hardly the faintest



pretense of complying with these conditions.  Moreover,



their charter required that their property should be



free from all encumbrance; and yet the so-called donor of



it, Mr. Charles Cook, could not be induced to cancel a



small mortgage which he held upon it.  Still worse, before



the legislature had been in session many days, it was found



that his agent had introduced a bill to relieve the People 's



College of all conditions, and to give it, without any pledge



whatever, the whole land grant, amounting to very nearly



a million of acres.







But even worse than this was another difficulty.  In



addition to the strong lobby sent by Mr. Cook to Albany in



behalf of the People's College, there came representatives



of nearly all the smaller denominational colleges in the



State, men eminent and influential, clamoring for a division



of the fund among their various institutions, though



the fragment which would have fallen to each would not



have sufficed to endow even a single professorship.







While all this was uncertain, and the fund seemed



likely to be utterly frittered away, I was one day going



down from the State Capitol, when Mr. Cornell joined me



and began conversation.  He was, as usual, austere and



reserved in appearance; but I had already found that



below this appearance there was a warm heart and noble



purpose.  No observant associate could fail to notice that



the only measures in the legislature which he cared for



were those proposing some substantial good to the State



or nation, and that he despised all political wrangling and



partizan jugglery.







On this occasion, after some little general talk, he quietly



said, ``I have about half a million dollars more than my



family will need: what is the best thing I can do with it



for the State?''  I answered:  `` Mr. Cornell, the two things



most worthy of aid in any country are charity and education;



but, in our country, the charities appeal to everybody. 



Any one can understand the importance of them,



and the worthy poor or unfortunate are sure to be taken



care of.  As to education, the lower grades will always be



cared for in the public schools by the State; but the



institutions of the highest grade, without which the lower can



never be thoroughly good, can be appreciated by only a



few.  The policy of our State is to leave this part of the



system to individuals; it seems to me, then, that if you



have half a million to give, the best thing you can do with



it is to establish or strengthen some institution for higher



instruction.''  I then went on to show him the need of a



larger institution for such instruction than the State then



had; that such a college or university worthy of the State



would require far more in the way of faculty and equipment



than most men supposed; that the time had come



when scientific and technical education must be provided



for in such an institution; and that education in history



and literature should be the bloom of the whole growth.







He listened attentively, but said little.  The matter



seemed to end there; but not long afterward he came to me



and said:  ``I agree with you that the land-grant fund



ought to be kept together, and that there should be a new



institution fitted to the present needs of the State and the



country.  I am ready to pledge to such an institution a site



and five hundred thousand dollars as an addition to the



land-grant endowment, instead of three hundred thousand,



as I proposed at Rochester.''







As may well be imagined, I hailed this proposal



joyfully, and soon sketched out a bill embodying his purpose



so far as education was concerned.  But here I wish to say



that, while Mr. Cornell urged Ithaca as the site of the



proposed institution, he never showed any wish to give his



own name to it.  The suggestion to that effect was mine. 



He at first doubted the policy of it; but, on my insisting



that it was in accordance with time-honored American



usage, as shown by the names of Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth,



Amherst, Bowdoin, Brown, Williams, and the like, he yielded.







We now held frequent conferences as to the leading



features of the institution to be created.  In these I was



more and more impressed by his sagacity and largeness



of view; and, when the sketch of the bill was fully



developed,--its financial features by him, and its educational



features by me,--it was put into shape by Charles J. Folger



of Geneva, then chairman of the judiciary committee of



the Senate, afterward chief judge of the Court of Appeals,



and finally Secretary of the Treasury of the United States. 



The provision forbidding any sectarian or partizan



predominance in the board of trustees or faculty was proposed



by me, heartily acquiesced in by Mr. Cornell, and put into



shape by Judge Folger.  The State-scholarship feature



and the system of alumni representation on the board of



trustees were also accepted by Mr. Cornell at my suggestion.







I refer to these things especially because they show one



striking characteristic of the man--namely, his readiness



to be advised largely by others in matters which he felt



to be outside his own province, and his willingness to give



the largest measure of confidence when he gave any



confidence at all.







On the other hand, the whole provision for the endowment,



the part relating to the land grant, and, above all,



the supplementary legislation allowing him to make a



contract with the State for ``locating'' the lands, were



thought out entirely by himself; and in all these matters he



showed, not only a public spirit far beyond that displayed



by any other benefactor of education in his time, but a



foresight which seemed to me then, and seems to me now,



almost miraculous.  He alone, of all men in the United



States, was able to foresee what might be done by an



individual to develop the land-grant fund, and he alone



was willing to make the great personal sacrifice thereby



required.







But, while he thus left the general educational features



to me, he uttered, during one of our conversations, words



which showed that he had arrived at the true conception



of a university.  He expressed the hope that in the proposed



institution every student might find instruction in



whatever study interested him.  Hence came the legend



now surrounding his medallion portrait upon the university



seal:  ``I would found an institution where any person



can find instruction in any study.''







The introduction of this new bill into the legislature



was a signal for war.  Nearly all the denominational



colleges girded themselves for the fray, and sent their agents



to fight us at Albany; they also stirred up the secular



press, without distinction of party, in the regions where



they were situated, and the religious organs of their various



sects in the great cities.







At the center of the movement against us was the



People's College; it had rallied in force and won over the



chairman of the educational committee in the Assembly,



so that under various pretexts he delayed considering the



bill.  Worst of all, there appeared against us, late in the



session, a professor from the Genesee College--a man of



high character and great ability; and he did his work most



vigorously.  He brought the whole force of his sect to



bear upon the legislature, and insisted that every other



college in the State had received something from the public



funds, while his had received none.







As a first result came a proposal from some of his



associates that twenty-five thousand dollars of the land-grant



fund be paid to Genesee College; but this the friends of



the Cornell bill resisted, on the ground that, if the fund



were broken into in one case, it would be in others.







It was next proposed that Mr. Cornell should agree to



give twenty-five thousand dollars to Genesee College on



the passage of the bill.  This Mr. Cornell utterly refused,



saying that not for the passage of any bill would he make



any private offer or have any private understanding; that



every condition must be put into the bill, where all men



could see it; and that he would then accept or reject it as



he might think best.  The result was that our opponents



forced into the bill a clause requiring him to give twenty-



five thousand dollars to Genesee College, before he could



be allowed to give five hundred thousand dollars to the



proposed university; and the friends of the bill, not feeling



strong enough to resist this clause, and not being



willing to see the enterprise wrecked for the want of it,



allowed it to go unopposed.  The whole matter was vexatious



to the last degree.  A man of less firmness and



earnestness, thus treated, would have thrown up his



munificent purpose in disgust; but Mr. Cornell quietly



persevered.







Yet the troubles of the proposed university had only



begun.  Mr. Charles Cook, who, during his senatorship,



had secured the United States land grant of 1862 for the



People's College, was a man of great force, a born leader



of men, anxious to build up his part of the State, and



especially the town from which he came, though he had no



special desire to put any considerable part of his own



wealth into a public institution.  He had seen the opportunities



afforded by the land grant, had captured it, and was



now determined to fight for it.  The struggle became



bitter.  His emissaries, including the members of the Senate



and Assembly from his part of the State, made common



cause with the sectarian colleges, and with various



corporations and persons who, having bills of their own



in the legislature, were ready to exchange services and



votes.







The coalition of all these forces against the Cornell



University bill soon became very formidable, and the



committee on education in the Assembly, to which the bill had



been referred, seemed more and more controlled by them. 



Our only hope now was to enlighten the great body of the



senators and assemblymen.  To this end Mr. Cornell invited



them by squads, sometimes to his rooms at Congress



Hall, sometimes to mine at the Delavan House.  There he



laid before them his general proposal and the financial



side of the plan, while I dwelt upon the need of a university



in the true sense of the word; upon the opportunity



now offered by this great fund; upon the necessity of



keeping it together; upon the need of large means to carry



out any scheme of technical and general education such



as was contemplated by the congressional act of 1862;



showed the proofs that the People's College would and



could do nothing to meet this want; that division of the



fund among the existing colleges was simply the annihilation



of it; and, in general, did my best to enlighten the



reason and arouse the patriotism of the members on the



subject of a worthy university in our State.  These points



and others were finally embodied in my speech before the



Senate, and this having been published in the ``Albany



Journal,'' Mr. Cornell provided for its circulation broadcast



over the State and thus aroused public opinion.







In this way we won to our support several strong



friends in both Houses, among them some men of great



natural force of character who had never enjoyed the



privilege of much early education, but who were none the



less anxious that those who came after them should have



the best opportunities.  Of these I may name especially



Senators Cook of Saratoga and Ames of Oswego.  Men



of high education and culture also aided us, especially



Mr. Andrews, Mr. Havens, and, finally, Judge Folger in



the Senate, with Mr. Lord and Mr. Weaver in the Assembly.







While we were thus laboring with the legislature as a



whole, serious work had to be done with the Assembly



committee; and Mr. Cornell employed a very eminent



lawyer to present his case, while Mr. Cook employed one



no less noted to take the opposite side.  The session of



the committee was held in the Assembly chamber, and there



was a large attendance of spectators; but, unfortunately,



the lawyer employed by Mr. Cornell having taken little



pains with the case, his speech was cold, labored, perfunctory,



and fell flat.  The speech on the other side was much



more effective; it was thin and demagogical, but the



speaker knew well the best tricks for catching the average



man.  He indulged in eloquent tirades against the Cornell



bill as a ``monopoly,'' a ``wild project,'' a ``selfish



scheme,'' a ``job,'' a ``grab,'' and the like; denounced Mr.



Cornell as ``seeking to erect a monument to himself'';



hinted that he was ``planning to rob the State''; and,



before he had finished, had pictured Mr. Cornell as a



swindler and the rest of us as dupes or knaves.







I can never forget the quiet dignity with which Mr.



Cornell took this abuse.  Mrs. Cornell sat at his right, I



at his left.  In one of the worst tirades against him, he



turned to me and said quietly, and without the slightest



anger or excitement:  ``If I could think of any other way



in which half a million of dollars would do as much good



to the State, I would give the legislature no more trouble.'' 



Shortly afterward, when the invective was again especially



bitter, he turned to me and said:  ``I am not sure



but that it would be a good thing for me to give the half



a million to old Harvard College in Massachusetts, to



educate the descendants of the men who hanged my forefathers.''







There was more than his usual quaint humor in this



--there was that deep reverence which he always bore



toward his Quaker ancestry, and which seemed to have



become part of him.  I admired Mr. Cornell on many



occasions, but never more than during that hour when he



sat, without the slightest anger, mildly taking the abuse of



that prostituted pettifogger, the indifference of the



committee, and the laughter of the audience.  It was a scene



for a painter, and I trust that some day it will be fitly



perpetuated for the university.







This struggle being ended, the Assembly committee



could not be induced to report the bill.  It was easy, after



such a speech, for its members to pose as protectors of



the State against a swindler and a monopoly; the chairman,



who, shortly after the close of the session, was



mysteriously given a position in the New York custom-house,



made pretext after pretext without reporting, until it became



evident that we must have a struggle in the Assembly



and drag the bill out of the committee in spite of him. 



To do this required a two-thirds vote.  All our friends



were set to work, and some pains taken to scare the



corporations which had allied themselves with the enemy, in



regard to the fate of their own bills, by making them



stand that, unless they stopped their interested



opposition to the university bill in the House, a feeling



would be created in the Senate very unfortunate for them. 



In this way their clutch upon sundry members of the



Assembly was somewhat relaxed, and these were allowed



to vote according to their consciences.







The Cornell bill was advocated most earnestly in the



House by Mr. Henry B. Lord: in his unpretentious way



he marshaled the university forces, and moved that the bill



be taken from the committee and referred to the Committee



of the Whole.  Now came a struggle.  Most of the



best men in the Assembly stood by us; but the waverers



--men who feared local pressure, sectarian hostility, or



the opposition of Mr. Cook to measures of their own--



attempted, if not to oppose the Cornell bill, at least to



evade a vote upon it.  In order to give them a little tone



and strength, Mr. Cornell went with me to various leading



editors in the city of New York, and we explained



the whole matter to them, securing editorial articles



favorable to the university, the most prominent among these



gentlemen being Horace Greeley of the ``Tribune,'' Eras-



tus Brooks of the ``Express,'' and Manton Marble of the



``World.''  This did much for us, yet when the vote was



taken the old cowardice was again shown; but several of



us stood in the cloak-room and fairly shamed the waverers



back into their places.  As a result, to the surprise and



disgust of the chairman of the Assembly committee, the



bill was taken out of his control, and referred to the



Committee of the Whole House.







Another long struggle now ensued, but the bill was



finally passed in the Assembly and came back to the



Senate.  There the struggle was renewed, all kinds of



delaying tactics were resorted to, but the bill was finally



carried, and received the signature of Governor Fenton.







Now came a new danger.  During their struggle against



the bill, our enemies had been strong enough to force into



it a clause enabling the People's College to retain the land



fund, provided that institution should be shown, within six



months of the passage of the bill, to be in possession of a



sum such as the Board of Regents should declare would



enable it to comply with the conditions on which it had



originally received the grant.  The Board of Regents



now reported that the possession of one hundred and



fifty thousand dollars would be sufficient for such a



compliance, and would insure the fund to the People's



College.  Naturally we watched, in much uneasy suspense,



during those six months, to see whether Mr. Cook and



the People's College authorities would raise this sum



of money, so small in comparison with that which Mr.



Cornell was willing to give, in order to secure the grant. 



But our fears were baseless; and on the fifth day of



September, 1865, the trustees of Cornell University were



assembled for the first time at Ithaca.







Then came to them a revelation of a quality in Mr. Cornell



unknown to most of them before.  In one of the petitions



forwarded from Ithaca to the legislature by his



fellow-citizens it had been stated that ``he never did less



than he promised, but generally more.''  So it was found



in this case.  He turned over to the trustees, not only the



securities for the five hundred thousand dollars required



by the charter, but also gave two hundred acres of land as



a site.  Thus came into being Cornell University.







Yet the services of Mr. Cornell had only begun: he at



once submitted to us a plan for doing what no other citizen



had done for any other State.  In the other commonwealths



which had received the land grant, the authorities



had taken the scrip representing the land, sold it at the



market price, and, as the market was thus glutted, had



realized but a small sum; but Mr. Cornell, with that



foresight which was his most striking characteristic, saw



clearly what could be done by using the scrip to take up



land for the institution.  To do this he sought aid in various



ways; but no one dared join him, and at last he determined



to bear the whole burden himself.  Scrip representing



over seven hundred thousand acres still remained



in the hands of the comptroller.  The trustees received Mr.



Cornell's plan for dealing with the scrip somewhat doubtfully,



but the enabling act was passed, by which he was



permitted to ``locate'' this land for the benefit of the



university.  So earnest was he in this matter that he was



anxious to take up the entire amount, but here his near



friends interposed: we saw too well what a crushing load



the taxes and other expenses on such a vast tract of land



would become before it could be sold to advantage.  Finally



he yielded somewhat: it was agreed that he should take up



five hundred thousand acres, and he now gave himself day



and night to this great part of the enterprise, which was



to provide a proper financial basis for a university such as



we hoped to found.







Meanwhile, at Mr. Cornell's suggestion, I devoted myself



to a more careful plan of the new institution; and, at



the next meeting of the board, presented a ``plan of



organization,'' which sketched out the purpose and



constitution of such a university as seemed needed in a great



commonwealth like ours.  Mr. Cornell studied it carefully,



gave it his approval, and a copy of it with marginal notes



in his own hand is still preserved.







I had supposed that this was to end my relations with



Mr. Cornell, so far as the university was concerned.  A



multitude of matters seemed to forbid my taking any further



care for it, and a call to another position very attractive



to me drew me away from all thought of connection



with it, save, perhaps, such as was involved in meeting the



trustees once or twice a year.







Mr. Cornell had asked me, from time to time, whether



I could suggest any person for the presidency of the



university.  I mentioned various persons, and presented the



arguments in their favor.  One day he said to me quietly



that he also had a candidate; I asked him who it was, and



he said that he preferred to keep the matter to himself



until the next meeting of the trustees.  Nothing more passed



between us on that subject.  I had no inkling of his



purpose, but thought it most likely that his candidate was



a Western gentleman whose claims had been strongly



pressed upon him.  When the trustees came together, and



the subject was brought up, I presented the merits of various



gentlemen, especially of one already at the head of an



important college in the State, who, I thought, would give



us success.  Upon this, Mr. Cornell rose, and, in a very



simple but earnest speech, presented my name.  It was entirely



unexpected by me, and I endeavored to show the trustees



that it was impossible for me to take the place in view of



other duties; that it needed a man of more robust health,



of greater age, and of wider reputation in the State.  But



Mr. Cornell quietly persisted, our colleagues declared



themselves unanimously of his opinion, and, with many



misgivings, I gave a provisional acceptance.







The relation thus begun ended only with Mr. Cornell's



life, and from first to last it grew more and more interesting



to me.  We were thrown much together at Albany, at



Ithaca, and on various journeys undertaken for the



university; and, the more I saw of him, the deeper became my



respect for him.  There were, indeed, toward the end of



his life, some things trying to one of my temperament,



and among these things I may mention his exceeding reticence, 



and his willingness not only to labor but to wait;



but these stood not at all in the way of my respect and



affection for him.







His liberality was unstinted.  While using his fortune



in taking up the lands, he was constantly doing generous



things for the university and those connected with it.  One



of the first of these was his gift of the library in classical



literature collected by Dr. Charles Anthon of Columbia



College.  Nothing could apparently be more outside his



sympathy than the department needing these seven thousand



volumes; but he recognized its importance in the general



plan of the new institution, bought the library for



over twelve thousand dollars, and gave it to the university.







Then came the Jewett collection in geology, which he



gave at a cost of ten thousand dollars; the Ward collection



of casts, at a cost of three thousand; the Newcomb collection



in conchology, at a cost of sixteen thousand; an addition



to the university grounds, valued at many thousands



more; and it was only the claims of a multitude of minor



university matters upon his purse which prevented his



carrying out a favorite plan of giving a great telescope, at



a cost of fifty thousand dollars.  At a later period, to



extinguish the university debt, to increase the equipment, and



eventually to provide free scholarships and fellowships,



he made an additional gift of about eighty thousand dollars.







While doing these things, he was constantly advancing



large sums in locating the university lands, and in paying



university salaries, for which our funds were not yet



available; while from time to time he made many gifts which,



though smaller, were no less striking evidences of the



largeness of his view.  I may mention a few among these



as typical.







Having found, in the catalogue of a London book-



seller, a set of Piranesi's great work on the ``Antiquities



of Rome,''--a superb copy, the gift of a pope to a royal



duke,--I showed it to him, when he at once ordered it for



our library at a cost of about a thousand dollars.  At



another time, seeing the need of some costly works to



illustrate agriculture, he gave them to us at a somewhat



greater cost; and, having heard Professor Tyndall's



lectures in New York, he bought additional physical apparatus



to enable our resident professor to repeat the lectures



at Ithaca, and this cost him fifteen hundred dollars.







Characteristic of him, too, was another piece of quiet



munificence.  When the clause forced into the university



charter, requiring him to give twenty-five thousand dollars



to another institution before he could be allowed to



give half a million to his own, was noised abroad through



the State, there was a general feeling of disgust; and at



the next session of the legislature a bill was brought in



to refund the twenty-five thousand dollars to him.  Upon



this, he remarked that what he once gave he never took



back, but that if the university trustees would accept it he



had no objection.  The bill was modified to this effect, and



thus the wrong was righted.







During my stay in Europe, through the summer of 1868,



under instructions to study various institutions for technical



education, to make large purchases of books, and to



secure one or two men greatly needed in special departments



not then much cultivated in this country, his generosity



was unfailing.  Large as were the purchases which



I was authorized to make, the number of desirable things



outside this limit steadily grew larger; but my letters to



him invariably brought back the commission to secure



this additional material.







During this occupation of mine in Europe, he was quite



as busy in the woods of the upper Mississippi and on the



plains of Kansas, selecting university lands.  No fatigue



or expenditure deterred him.







At various periods I passed much time with Mr. Cornell



on his home farm.  He lived generously, in a kind of



patriarchal simplicity, and many of his conversations interested



me intensely.  His reticence gradually yielded, and he gave



me much information regarding his earlier years: they had



been full of toil and struggle, but through the whole there



was clear evidence of a noble purpose.  Whatever worthy



work his hand had found to do, he had done it with his



might: the steamers of Cayuga Lake; the tunnel which



carries the waters of Fall Creek to the mills below; the



mills themselves; the dams against that turbulent stream,



which he built after others had failed, and which stand



firmly to this day; the calendar clocks for which Ithaca



has become famous, and of which he furnished the original



hint--all these he touched upon, though so modestly that



I never found out his full agency in them until a later



period, when I had made the acquaintance of many of his



townsmen.







Especially interesting were his references to the



beginnings of American telegraphic enterprise, with which he



had so much to do.







His connection with it began in a curious way.  Traveling



in northern New England to dispose of a plow which



he had invented, he entered the office of a gentleman who



had taken the contract for laying the first telegraphic wires



underground between Washington and Baltimore, and



found him in much doubt and trouble: the difficulty was to



lay the leaden pipe containing the two insulated wires at a



cost within the terms of the contract.  Hearing this, Mr.



Cornell said:  ``I will build you a machine which will dig



the trench, lay the pipe and wires, and cover them with



earth rapidly and cheaply.''







This proposal was at first derided; but, as Mr. Cornell



insisted upon it, he was at last allowed to show what he



could do.  The machine having been constructed, he



exhibited it to a committee; but when the long line of



horses attached to it were started, it was so thrown about



by the inequalities of the surface that the committee



declared it a failure.  Presently Mr. Cornell took them to



the ground over which the machine had just passed, and,



showing them a line of newly turned earth, asked them



to dig in it.  Having done this, they found the pipe incasing



the wires, acknowledged his triumph, and immediately



gave him and his machine permanent employment.







But before long he became convinced that this was not



the best way.  Having studied all the books on electricity



that he could find in the Congressional Library, he had



satisfied himself that it would be far better and cheaper



to string the wires through the open air between poles. 



This idea the men controlling the scheme for a time



resisted.  Some of them regarded such interference in a



scientific matter by one whom they considered a plain



working-man as altogether too presuming.  But one day



Professor Morse came out to decide the matter.  Finding



Mr. Cornell at his machine, the professor explained the



difficulties in the case, especially the danger of shaking the



confidence of Congress, and so losing the necessary



appropriation, should any change in plan be adopted, and



then asked him if he could see any way out of the difficulty. 



Mr. Cornell answered that he could, whereupon Professor



Morse expressed a wish that it might be taken.  At this



Mr. Cornell gave the word to his men, started up the



long line of horses dragging the ponderous machine,



guided it with his own hands into a boulder lying near,



and thus deranged the whole machinery.







As a natural result it was announced by various journals



at the national capital that the machinery for laying



the wires had been broken by the carelessness of an



employee, but that it would doubtless soon be repaired and



the work resumed.  Thanks to this stratagem, the necessary



time was gained without shaking the confidence of



Congress, and Mr. Cornell at once began stringing the



wires upon poles: the insulation was found far better



than in the underground system, and there was no more



trouble.







The confidence of the promoters of the enterprise being



thus gained, Mr. Cornell was employed to do their work



in all parts of the country; and his sturdy honesty, energy,



and persistence justified their confidence and laid the



foundations of his fortune.







Very striking were the accounts of his troubles and



trials during the prosecution of this telegraphic work--



troubles from men of pretended science, from selfish men,



from stupid men--all chronicled by him without the slightest



bitterness against any human being, yet with a quaint



humor which made the story very enjoyable.







Through his personal history, as I then began to learn



it, ran a thread, or rather a strong cord, of stoicism. 



He had clung with such desperate tenacity to his faith in



the future of the telegraphic system, that, sooner than part



with his interest in it, even when its stock was utterly



discredited, he suffered from poverty, and almost from want. 



While pressing on his telegraphic construction, he had been



terribly wounded in a Western railroad accident, but had



extricated himself from the dead and dying, and, as I



learned from others, had borne his sufferings without a



murmur.  At another time, overtaken by ship-fever at



Montreal, and thought to be beyond help, he had quietly



made up his mind that, if he could reach a certain hydropathic



establishment in New York, he would recover; and



had dragged himself through that long journey, desperately



ill as he was, in railway cars, steamers, and



stages, until he reached his desired haven; and there he



finally recovered, though nearly every other person



attacked by the disease at his Montreal hotel had died.







Pursuing his telegraphic enterprise, he had been obliged



at times to fight many strong men and great combinations



of capital; but this same stoicism carried him through:



he used to say laughingly that his way was to ``tire them



out.''







When, at last, fortune had begun to smile upon him, his



public spirit began to show itself in more striking forms,



though not in forms more real, than in his earlier days. 



Evidences of this met the eye of his visitors at once, and



among these were the fine cattle, sheep, fruit-trees, and



the like, which he had brought back from the London



Exposition of 1851.  His observations of the agricultural



experiments of Lawes and Gilbert at Rothamstead in



England, and his visits to various agricultural exhibitions,



led him to attempt similar work at home.  Everything



that could improve the community in which he lived



was matter of concern to him.  He took the lead in



establishing ``Cascadilla Place,'' in order to give a very



gifted woman an opportunity to show her abilities in



administering hydropathic treatment to disease; his



public library, when I first visited Ithaca, was just



completed.







He never showed the slightest approach to display or



vanity regarding any of these things, and most of them I



heard of first, at a later period, from others.







Although his religious ideas were very far from those



generally considered orthodox, he had a deep sympathy



with every good effort for religion and morality, no matter



by whom made; and he contributed freely to churches



of every name and to good purposes of every sort.  He



had quaint ways at times in making such gifts, and from



the many stories showing these I select one as characteristic. 



During the Civil War, the young women of the village



held large sewing-circles, doing work for the soldiers. 



When Mr. Cornell was asked to contribute to their funds,



he declined, to the great surprise of those who asked



him, and said dryly:  ``Of course these women don't really



come together to sew for the soldiers; they come together



to gossip.''  This was said, no doubt, with that peculiar



twinkle of the eye which his old friends can well remember;



but, on the young ladies protesting that he did them



injustice, he answered:  ``If you can prove that I am wrong,



I will gladly contribute; if you will only sew together all



one afternoon, and no one of you speak a word, I will give



you a hundred dollars.''  The society met, and complete



silence reigned.  The young men of the community, hearing



of this, and seeing an admirable chance to tease their



fair friends, came in large numbers to the sewing-circle,



and tried to engage them in conversation.  At first their



attempts were in vain; but, finally, to a question skilfully



put, one of the young ladies made a reply.  This broke



the spell.  Of course, the whole assembly were very unhappy;



but, when all was told to Mr. Cornell, he said: 



``They shall have their hundred dollars, for they have



done better than any other women ever did.''







But I ought to say here that this little episode would



be grossly misunderstood were it supposed to indicate any



tendency in his heart or mind toward a cynical view of



womankind.  Nothing could be more manly and noble



than his reference to her who had stood at his side



courageously, hopefully, and cheerily during his years



of struggle and want of appreciation.  Well might he



speak of her, as he did once in my hearing, as ``the best



woman that ever lived.''  And his gentle courtliness and



thoughtful kindness were also deeply appreciated in other



households.  His earnestness, too, in behalf of the higher



education of women, and of their fair treatment in various



professions and occupations, showed something far deeper



than conventional politeness.







From the time when I began to know him best, his main



thought was concentrated upon the university.  His own



business interests were freely sacrificed; his time, wealth,



and effort were all yielded to his work in taking up its



lands, to say nothing of supplementary work which became



in many ways a heavy burden to him.







During the summer preceding the opening of the university,



this labor and care began to wear upon him, and



he was attacked by an old malady which gave him great



pain; yet his stoicism asserted itself.  Through night after



night, as I lay in the room next his at his farm-house, I



could hear him groan, and to my natural sympathy was



added a fear lest he might not live through this most critical



period in the history of the new institution; but,



invariably, when I met him next morning and asked how he



felt, his answer was, ``All right,'' or ``Very well.''  I



cannot remember ever hearing him make any complaint



of his sufferings or even any reference to them.







Nor did pain diminish his steady serenity or generosity. 



I remember that on one hot afternoon of that summer,



when he had come into the house thoroughly weary, a



young man called upon him to ask for aid in securing



school-books.  Mr. Cornell questioned him closely, and



then rose, walked with him down the hill into the town,



and bought the books which were needed.







As the day approached for the formal opening of the



university, he was obliged to remain in bed.  Care and



toil had prostrated me also; and both of us, a sorry couple



indeed, had to be taken from our beds to be carried to the



opening exercises.







A great crowd had assembled from all parts of the



State:--many enthusiastic, more doubtful, and some



decidedly inclined to scoff.







Some who were expected were not present.  The Governor



of the State, though he had been in Ithaca the day



before, quietly left town on the eve of the opening



exercises.  His Excellency was a very wise man in his



generation, and evidently felt that it was not best for him to



have too much to do with an institution which the sectarian



press had so generally condemned.  I shall not soon forget



the way in which Mr. Cornell broke the news to me, and



the accent of calm contempt in his voice.  Fortunately



there remained with us the lieutenant-governor, General



Stewart Lyndon Woodford.  He came to the front nobly,



and stood by us firmly and munificently ever afterward.







Mr. Cornell's speech on that occasion was very simple



and noble; his whole position, to one who knew what he



had gone through in the way of obloquy, hard work, and



self-sacrifice, was touching.  Worn down by illness, he



was unable to stand, and he therefore read his address in



a low tone from his chair.  It was very impressive, almost



incapacitating me from speaking after him, and I saw



tears in the eyes of many in the audience.  Nothing could



be more simple than this speech of his; it was mainly



devoted to a plain assertion of the true university theory in



its most elementary form, and to a plea that women should



have equal privileges with men in advanced education.  In



the midst of it came a touch of his quaint shrewdness; for,



in replying to a recent charge that everything at the



university was unfinished, he remarked in substance, ``We



have not invited you to see a university finished, but to see



one begun.''







The opening day seemed a success, but this very success



stirred up the enemy.  A bitter letter from Ithaca



to a leading denominational organ in New York gave the



signal, and soon the whole sectarian press was in full cry,



steadily pressing upon Mr. Cornell and those who stood



near him.  Very many of the secular presses also thought



it wise to join in the attack, and it was quickly extended



from his ideas to his honor, and even to his honesty.  It



seemed beyond the conception of many of these gentlemen



that a Hicksite Quaker, who, if he gave any thought at



all to this or that creed, or this or that ``plan of salvation,''



passed it all by as utterly irrelevant and inadequate,



could be a religious man; and a far greater number seemed



to find it just as difficult to believe that a man could



sacrifice his comfort and risk his fortune in managing so great



a landed property for the public interest without any



concealed scheme of plunder.







But he bore all this with his usual stoicism.  It seemed



to increase his devotion to the institution, rather than to



diminish it.  When the receipts from the endowment fell



short or were delayed, he continued to advance money



freely to meet the salaries of the professors; and for



apparatus, books, and equipment of every sort his purse



was constantly opened.







Yet, in those days of toil and care and obloquy, there



were some things which encouraged him much.  At that



period all patriotic Americans felt deep gratitude to Goldwin



Smith for his courage and eloquence in standing by



our country during the Civil War, and great admiration for



his profound and brilliant historical lectures at Oxford. 



Naturally, on arriving in London, I sought to engage him



for the new university, and was authorized by Mr. Cornell



to make him large pecuniary offers.  Professor Smith entered



at once into our plans heartily; wrote to encourage



us; came to us; lived with us amid what, to him, must have



been great privations; lectured for us year after year as



brilliantly as he had ever lectured at Oxford; gave his



library to the university, with a large sum for its increase;



lent his aid very quietly, but none the less effectually, to



needy and meritorious students; and steadily refused



then, as he has ever since done, and now does, to accept



a dollar of compensation.  Nothing ever gave Mr. Cornell



more encouragement than this.  For ``Goldwin,'' as he



called him in his Quaker way, there was always a very



warm corner in his heart.







He also found especial pleasure in many of the lecture-



courses established at the opening of the university.  For



Professor Agassiz he formed a warm friendship; and



their discussions regarding geological questions were very



interesting, eliciting from Agassiz a striking tribute to



Mr. Cornell's closeness of observation and sagacity in



reasoning.  The lectures on history by Goldwin Smith,



and on literature by James Russell Lowell, George William



Curtis, and Bayard Taylor, he also enjoyed greatly.







The scientific collections and apparatus of various sorts



gave him constant pleasure.  I had sent from England,



France, and Germany a large number of charts, models,



and pieces of philosophical apparatus, and regarding



some of them had thought it best to make careful explanations



to him, in order to justify so large an expenditure;



but I soon found this unnecessary.  His shrewd mind



enabled him to understand any piece of apparatus quickly,



and to appreciate it fully.  I have never had to deal with



any man whose instinct in such matters was more true.  If



a book or scientific specimen or piece of apparatus was



necessary to the proper work of a department, he could



easily be made to see it; and then it MUST come to us, no



matter at what cost.  Like the great prince of navigators



in the fifteenth century, he was a man ``who had the



taste for great things''--``qui tenia gusto en cosas



grandes.''  He felt that the university was to be great,



and he took his measures accordingly.  His colleagues



generally thought him over-sanguine; and when he declared



that the university should yet have an endow-



ment of three millions, most of them regarded him as a



dreamer.







I have never known a man more entirely unselfish.  I



have seen him, when his wealth was counted in millions,



devote it so generously to university objects that he felt



it necessary to stint himself in some matters of personal



comfort.  When urged to sell a portion of the university



land at a sacrifice, in order to better our foundations, he



answered in substance, ``Don't let us do that yet; I will



wear my old hat and coat a little longer, and let you have



a little more money from my own pocket.''







This feeling seemed never diminished, even under the



worst opposition.  He ``kept the faith,'' no matter who



opposed him.







An eminent and justly respected president of one of the



oldest Eastern universities published a treatise, which was



widely circulated, to prove that the main ideas on which



the new university was based were utterly impracticable;



and especially that the presentation of various courses of



instruction suited to young men of various aims and



tastes, with liberty of choice between them, was preposterous. 



It is interesting to note that this same eminent gentleman



was afterward led to adopt this same ``impracticable''



policy at his own university.  Others of almost equal



eminence insisted that to give advanced scientific and



technical instruction in the same institution with classical



instruction was folly; and these gentlemen were probably



not converted until the plan was adopted at English Cambridge. 



Others still insisted that an institution not belonging



to any one religious sect must be ``godless,'' would



not be patronized, and could not succeed.  Their eyes were



opened later by the sight of men and women of different



Christian denominations pressing forward at Cornell



University to contribute sums which, in the aggregate,



amounted to much more than the original endowment.







He earned the blessing of those who, not having seen,



have yet believed.  Though he did not live long enough



to see the fundamental principles of the university thus



force their way to recognition and adoption by those who



had most strongly opposed them, his faith remained



undiminished to the end of his life.







But the opposition to his work developed into worse



shapes; many leading journals in the State, when not



openly hostile to him, were cold and indifferent, and some



of them were steadily abusive.  This led to a rather wide-



spread feeling that ``where there is smoke, there must be



fire''; and we who knew the purity of his purpose, his



unselfishness, his sturdy honesty, labored long against this



feeling.







I regret to say that some eminent men connected with



important universities in the country showed far too much



readiness to acquiesce in this unfavorable view of our



founder.  From very few of our sister institutions came



any word of cheer; and from some of them came most



bitter attacks, not only upon the system adopted in the



new university, but upon Mr. Cornell himself.  But his



friends were more afflicted, by far, than he; all this opposition



only served to strengthen his faith.  As to this effect



upon him, I recall one or two quaint examples.  At the



darkest period in the history of the university, I



mentioned to him that a fine collection of mathematical



books was offered us for five thousand dollars.  Under



ordinary circumstances he would have bought it for



us at once; but at that moment, when any addition



to his burdens would not have been advised by any of



his friends, he quietly said, ``Somewhere there is a man



walking about who wants to give us that five thousand



dollars.''  I am glad to say that his faith was soon



justified; such a man appeared,--a man who was glad to give



the required sum as a testimony to his belief in Mr.



Cornell's integrity:  William Kelly of Rhinebeck.







Another example may be given as typical.  Near the



close of the first celebration of Founder's Day at one of



the college buildings, a pleasant social dance sprang up



among the younger people--students from the university



and young ladies from the village.  This brought a very



severe protest from sundry clergymen of the place,



declaring dancing to be ``destructive of vital godliness.'' 



Though this was solemnly laid before the faculty, no



answer was ever made to it; but we noticed that, at every



social gathering on Founder's Day afterward, as long as



Mr. Cornell lived, he had arrangements made for dancing. 



I never knew a man more open to right reason, and never



one less influenced by cant or dogmatism.







To most attacks upon him in the newspapers he neither



made nor suggested any reply; but one or two which were



especially misleading he answered simply and conclusively. 



This had no effect, of course, in stopping the attacks;



but it had one effect, at which the friends of the



university rejoiced: it bound his old associates to him all the



more closely, and led them to support him all the more



vigorously.  When a paper in one of the largest cities in



western New York had been especially abusive, one of Mr.



Cornell's old friends living in that city wrote:  ``I know



that the charges recently published are utterly untrue; but



I am not skilled in newspaper controversy, so I will simply



add to what I have already given to the university a special



gift of thirty thousand dollars, which will testify to



my townsmen here, and perhaps to the public at large, my



confidence in Mr. Cornell.''







Such was the way of Hiram Sibley.  Upon another attack,



especially violent, from the organ of one of the



denominational colleges, another old friend of Mr. Cornell



in the eastern part of the State, a prominent member of



the religious body which this paper represented, sent his



check for several thousand dollars, to be used for the



purchase of books for the library, and to show confidence



in Mr. Cornell by deeds as well as words.







Vile as these attacks were, worse remained behind.  A



local politician, who had been sent to the legislature from



the district where the ``People's College'' had lived its



short life, prepared, with pettifogging ability, a long speech



to show that the foundation of Cornell University, Mr.



Cornell's endowment of it, and his contract to locate the



lands for it were parts of a great cheat and swindle.  This



thesis, developed in all the moods and tenses of abuse



before the legislature, was next day published at length in the



leading journals of the metropolis, and echoed throughout



the Union.  The time for these attacks was skilfully



chosen; the Cr<e'>dit Mobilier and other schemes had been



revealed at Washington, and everybody was only too ready



to believe any charge against anybody.  That Mr. Cornell



had been known for forty years as an honest man seemed



to go for nothing.







The enemies of the university were prompt to support



the charges, and they found some echoes even among those



who were benefited by his generosity--even among the



students themselves.  At this I felt it my duty to call the



whole student body together, and, in a careful speech,



to explain Mr. Cornell's transactions, answering the



charges fully.  This speech, though spread through the



State, could evidently do but little toward righting the



wrong; but it brought to me what I shall always feel a



great honor--a share in the abuse showered mainly on him.







Very characteristic was Mr. Cornell's conduct under



this outrage.  That same faith in justice, that same



patience under wrong, which he always showed, was more



evident than ever.







On the morning after the attack in the legislature had



been blazoned in all the leading newspapers--in the early



hours, and after a sleepless night--I heard the rattle of



gravel against my window-panes.  On rising, I found Mr.



Cornell standing below.  He was serene and cheerful, and



had evidently taken the long walk up the hill to quiet my



irritation.  His first words were a jocose prelude.  The



bells of the university, which were then chimed at six



o'clock, were ringing merrily, and he called out, ``Come



down here and listen to the chimes; I have found a spot



where you can hear them directly with one ear, and their



echo with the other.''







When I had come down, we first investigated the echo



of the chime, which had really aroused his interest; then



he said seriously:  ``Don't make yourself unhappy over



this matter; it will turn out to be a good thing for the



university.  I have long foreseen that this attack must



come, but have feared that it would come after my death,



when the facts would be forgotten, and the transactions



little understood.  I am glad that the charges are made



now, while I am here to answer them.''  We then discussed



the matter, and it was agreed that he should telegraph and



write Governor Dix, asking him to appoint an investigating



committee, of which the majority should be from



the political party opposed to his own.  This was done. 



The committee was composed of Horatio Seymour,



formerly governor of the State and Democratic candidate



for the Presidency of the United States; William A.



Wheeler, Vice-President of the United States; and John



D. Van Buren, all three men of the highest standing, and



two of them politically opposed to Mr. Cornell.







During the long investigation which ensued in New



York and at Ithaca, he never lost his patience, though at



times sorely tried.  Various disappointed schemers, among



these one person who had not been allowed to make an



undue profit out of the university lands, and another who



had been allowed to depart from a professorship on



account of hopeless incompetency, were the main witnesses. 



The onslaught was led by the person who made the attack



in the legislature, and he had raked together a mass of



half-truths and surmises; but the evidence on Mr. Cornell's



side consisted of a complete exhibition of all the



facts and documents.  The unanimous report of the



committee was all that his warmest friends could desire; and



its recommendations regarding the management of the



fund were such as Mr. Cornell had long wished, but which



he had hardly dared ask.  The result was a complete triumph



for him.







Yet the attacks continued.  The same paper which had



been so prominent in sounding them through the western



part of the State continued them as before, and, almost



to the very day of his death, assailed him periodically as



a ``land jobber,'' ``land grabber,'' and ``land thief.''  But



he took these foul attacks by tricky declaimers and his



vindication by three of his most eminent fellow-citizens



with the same serenity.  That there was in him a profound



contempt for the wretched creatures who assailed him



and imputed to him motives as vile as their own can



hardly be doubted; yet, though I was with him constantly



during this period, I never heard him speak harshly of



them; nor could I ever see that this injustice diminished



his good will toward his fellow-men and his desire to



benefit them.







At the very time when these attacks were at their worst,



he was giving especial thought to the problem of bringing



education at the university within reach of young men of



good ability and small means.  I am quite within bounds in



saying that he gave an hour to thought upon this for



every minute he gave to thought upon the attacks of his



enemies.







It was during this period that he began building his



beautiful house near the university, and in this he showed



some of his peculiarities.  He took much pains to secure a



tasteful plan, and some of the ideas embodied in it



evidently resulted from his study of beautiful country-houses



in England.  Characteristic of him also was his way of



carrying on the work.  Having visited several quarries in



various parts of the State, in order to choose the best



possible building-stone, he employed some German stone-



carvers who had recently left work upon the Cathedral of



Cologne, brought them to Ithaca, and allowed them to work



on with no interference save from the architect.  If they



gave a month or more to the carving of a single capital



or corbel, he made no remonstrance.  When he had thus



secured the best stone-work, he selected the best seasoned



oak and walnut and called skilful carpenters from England.







In thus going abroad for artisans there was no want



of loyalty to his countrymen, nor was there any alloy



of vanity in his motives.  His purpose evidently was



to erect a house which should be as perfect a specimen



of the builder's art as he could make it, and therefore



useful, as an example of thoroughly good work, to the local



workmen.







In connection with this, another incident throws light



upon his characteristics.  Above the front entrance of the



house was a scroll, or ribbon, in stone, evidently intended



for a name or motto.  The words carved there were, ``True



and Firm.''  It is a curious evidence of the petty criticism



which beset him in those days, that this motto was at times



cited as a proof of his vainglory.  It gives me pleasure



to relieve any mind sensitive on this point, and to vindicate



the truth of history, by saying that it was I who



placed the motto there.  Calling his attention one day to



the scroll and to the need of an inscription, I suggested



a translation of the old German motto, ``Treu und Fest'';



and, as he made no objection, I wrote it out for the stone-



cutters, but told Mr. Cornell that there were people,



perhaps, who might translate the last word ``obstinate.''







The point of this lay in the fact, which Mr. Cornell knew



very well, that he was frequently charged with obstinacy. 



Yet an obstinate man, in the evil sense of that word, he



was not.  For several years it fell to my lot to discuss a



multitude of questions with him, and reasonableness was



one of his most striking characteristics.  He was one of



those very rare strong men who recognize adequately their



own limitations.  True, when he had finally made up his



mind in a matter fully within his own province, he



remained firm; but I have known very few men, wealthy,



strong, successful, as he was, so free from the fault of



thinking that, because they are good judges of one class of



questions, they are equally good in all others.  One mark of



an obstinate man is the announcement of opinions upon



subjects regarding which his experience and previous



training give him little or no means of judging.  This was



not at all the case with Mr. Cornell.  When questions arose



regarding internal university management, or courses of



study, or the choice of professors, or plans for their



accommodation, he was never quick in announcing or



tenacious in holding an opinion.  There was no purse pride



about him.  He evidently did not believe that his success



in building up a fortune had made him an expert or judge



in questions to which he had never paid special attention.







During the last year or two of his life, I saw not so



much of him as during several previous years.  He had



become greatly interested in various railway projects



having as their purpose the connection of Ithaca, as a



university town, with the State at large; and he threw



himself into these plans with great energy.  His course in



this was prompted by a public spirit as large and pure as



that which had led him to found the university.  When, at



the suggestion of sundry friends, I ventured to remonstrate



with him against going so largely into these railway



enterprises at his time of life, he said:  ``I shall live twenty



years longer, and make a million of dollars more for the



university endowment.''  Alas! within six months from



that day he lay dead in the midst of many broken hopes. 



His plans, which, under other circumstances, would have



been judged wise, seemed for a time wrecked by the financial



crisis which had just come upon the country.







In his last hours I visited him frequently.  His mind



remained clear, and he showed his old freedom from any



fault-finding spirit, though evidently oppressed by business



cares and bodily suffering.  His serenity was especially



evident as I sat with him the night before his



death, and I can never forget the placidity of his



countenance, both then and on the next morning, when all was



ended.







Something should be said regarding Mr. Cornell's



political ideas.  In the legislature he was a firm Republican,



but as free as possible from anything like partizan



bigotry.  Party ties in local matters sat lightly upon him. 



He spoke in public very little, and took far greater



interest in public improvement than in party advantage. 



With many of his political opponents his relations were



most friendly.  For such Democrats as Hiram Sibley,



Erastus Brooks, and William Kelly he had the deepest



respect and admiration.  He cared little for popular



clamor on any subject, braving it more than once by



his votes in the legislature.  He was evidently willing to



take any risk involved in waiting for the sober second



thought of the people.  He was as free from ordinary



ambition as from selfishness: when there was a call from



several parts of the State for his nomination as governor,



he said quietly, ``I prefer work for which I am better



fitted.''







There was in his ordinary bearing a certain austerity



and in his conversation an abruptness which interfered



somewhat with his popularity.  A student once said to



me, ``If Mr. Cornell would simply stand upon his pedestal



as our `Honored Founder,' and let us hurrah for him,



that would please us mightily; but when he comes into the



laboratory and asks us gruffly, `What are you wasting



your time at now?' we don't like him so well.''  The fact



on which this remark was based was that Mr. Cornell



liked greatly to walk quietly through the laboratories and



drafting-rooms, to note the work.  Now and then, when



he saw a student doing something which especially



interested him, he was evidently anxious, as he was wont



to say, ``to see what the fellow is made of,'' and he would



frequently put some provoking question, liking nothing



better than to receive a pithy answer.  Of his kind feelings



toward students I could say much.  He was not inclined



to coddle them, but was ever ready to help any who



were deserving.







Despite his apparent austerity, he was singularly free



from harshness in his judgments.  There were times when



he would have been justified in outbursts of bitterness



against those who attacked him in ways so foul and



maligned him in ways so vile; but I never heard any



bitter reply from him.  In his politics there was never



a drop of bitterness.  Only once or twice did I hear



him allude to any conduct which displeased him, and then



his comments were rather playful than otherwise.  On one



occasion, when he had written to a gentleman of great



wealth and deserved repute as a philanthropist, asking



him to join in carrying the burden of the land locations,



and had received an unfavorable answer, he made a remark



which seemed to me rather harsh.  To this I replied: 



``Mr. Cornell, Mr. ---- is not at all in fault; he does not



understand the question as you do; everybody knows that



he is a very liberal man.''  ``Oh,'' said Mr. Cornell, ``it's



easy enough to be liberal; the only hard part is drawing



the check.''







Of his intellectual characteristics, foresight was the most



remarkable.  Of all men in the country who had to do



with the college land grant of 1862, he alone discerned the



possibilities involved and had courage to make them actual.







Clearness of thought on all matters to which he gave his



attention was another striking characteristic; hence, whenever



he put anything on paper, it was lucid and cogent. 



There seems at times in his writings some of the



clear, quaint shrewdness so well known in Abraham Lincoln. 



Very striking examples of this are to be found in



his legislative speeches, in his address at the opening of



the university, and in his letters.







Among his moral characteristics, his truthfulness,



persistence, courage, and fortitude were most strongly



marked.  These qualities made him a man of peace.  He



regarded life as too short to be wasted in quarrels; his



steady rule was never to begin a lawsuit or have anything



to do with one, if it could be avoided.  The joy in



litigation and squabble, which has been the weakness of



so many men claiming to be strong, and the especial



curse of so many American churches, colleges, universities,



and other public organizations, had no place in his



strong, tolerant nature.  He never sought to publish the



sins of any one in the courts or to win the repute of an



uncompromising fighter.  In this peaceable disposition he



was prompted not only by his greatest moral quality:--



his charity toward his fellow-men, but by his greatest intel-



lectual quality:--his foresight; for he knew well ``the



glorious uncertainty of the law.''  He was a builder, not a



gladiator.







There resulted from these qualities an equanimity which



I have never seen equaled.  When his eldest son had been



elected to the highest office in the gift of the State



Assembly, and had been placed, evidently, on the way to the



governor 's chair,--afterward attained,--though it must



have gratified such a father, he never made any reference



to it in my hearing; and when the body of his favorite



grandson, a most winning and promising boy, killed



instantly by a terrible accident, was brought into his



presence, though his heart must have bled, his calmness seemed



almost superhuman.







His religious ideas were such as many excellent people



would hardly approve.  He had been born into the Society



of Friends; and their quietness, simplicity, freedom from



noisy activity, and devotion to the public good attached



him to them.  But his was not a bigoted attachment; he



went freely to various churches, aiding them without



distinction of sect, though finally he settled into a steady



attendance at the Unitarian Church in Ithaca, for the pastor



of which he conceived a great respect and liking.  He was



never inclined to say much about religion; but, in our



talks, he was wont to quote with approval from Pope's



``Universal Prayer''--and especially the lines:







   ``Teach me to feel another's woe,



        To hide the fault I see;



     The mercy I to others show,



        That mercy show to me.''











On the mere letter of Scripture he dwelt little; and,



while he never obtruded opinions that might shock any



person, and was far removed from scoffing or irreverence,



he did not hesitate to discriminate between parts of our



Sacred Books which he considered as simply legendary



and parts which were to him pregnant with eternal truth.







His religion seemed to take shape in a deeply reverent



feeling toward his Creator, and in a constant desire to



improve the condition of his fellow-creatures.  He was



never surprised or troubled by anything which any other



human being believed or did not believe; of intolerance



he was utterly incapable.  He sought no reputation as a



philanthropist, cared little for approval, and nothing for



applause; but I can say of him, without reserve, that,



during all the years I knew him, ``he went about doing



good.''















CHAPTER XIX







ORGANIZATION OF CORNELL UNIVERSITY--1865-1868







Although my formal election to the university presidency



did not take place until 1867, the duties implied



by that office had already been discharged by me



during two years.







While Mr. Cornell devoted himself to the financial



questions arising from the new foundation, he intrusted all



other questions to me.  Indeed, my duties may be said to



have begun when, as chairman of the Committee on Education



in the State Senate, I resisted all efforts to divide



the land-grant fund between the People's College and



the State Agricultural College; to have been continued



when I opposed the frittering away of the entire grant



among more than twenty small sectarian colleges; and



to have taken a more direct form when I drafted the



educational clauses of the university charter and advocated



it before the legislature and in the press.  This



advocacy was by no means a light task.  The influential



men who flocked to Albany, seeking to divide the fund



among various sects and localities, used arguments often



plausible and sometimes forcible.  These I dealt with



on various occasions, but especially in a speech before the



State Senate in 1865, in which was shown the character



of the interested opposition, the farcical equipment of



the People's College, the failure of the State Agricultural



College, the inadequacy of the sectarian colleges,



even though they called themselves universities; and I



did all in my power to communicate to my colleagues



something of my own enthusiasm for a university suitably



endowed, free from sectarian trammels, centrally



situated, and organized to meet fully the wants of the



State as regarded advanced education, general and



technical.







Three points I endeavored especially to impress upon



them in this speech.  First, that while, as regards primary



education, the policy of the State should be diffusion of



resources, it should be, as regards university education,



concentration of resources.  Secondly, that sectarian



colleges could not do the work required.  Thirdly, that any



institution for higher education in the State must form an



integral part of the whole system of public instruction;



that the university should not be isolated from the school



system, as were the existing colleges, but that it should



have a living connection with the system, should push its



roots down into it and through it, drawing life from it



and sending life back into it.  Mr. Cornell accepted this



view at once.  Mr. Horace Greeley, who, up to that time,



had supported the People's College, was favorably impressed



by it, and, more than anything else, it won for us



his support.  To insure this vital connection of the



proposed university with the school system, I provided in



the charter for four ``State scholarships'' in each of the



one hundred and twenty-eight Assembly districts.  These



scholarships were to be awarded to the best scholars in the



public schools of each district, after due examination, one



each year; each scholarship entitling the holder to free



instruction in the university for four years.  Thus the



university and the schools were bound closely together by



the constant and living tie of five hundred and twelve



students.  As the number of Assembly districts under the



new constitution was made, some years later, one hundred



and fifty, the number of these competitive free scholarships



is now six hundred.  They have served their purpose



well.  Thirty years of this connection have greatly



uplifted the whole school system of the State, and



made the university a life-giving power in it; while this



uplifting of the school system has enabled the university



steadily to raise and improve its own standard of instruction.







But during the earlier period of our plans there was



one serious obstacle--Charles James Folger.  He was the



most powerful member of the Senate, its president, and



chairman of the Judiciary Committee.  He had already won



wide respect as a county judge, had been longer in the



Senate than any other member, and had already given ample



evidence of the qualities which later in life raised him to



some of the highest positions, State and National.  His



instincts would have brought him to our side; for he was



broad-minded, enlightened, and earnestly in favor of all



good legislation.  He was also my personal friend, and



when I privately presented my views to him he acquiesced



in them.  But there were two difficulties.  First, he had in



his own city a denominational college, his own alma



mater, which, though small, was influential.  Still worse



for us, he had in his district the State Agricultural College,



which the founding of Cornell University must necessarily



wipe out of existence.  He might rise above the first



of these difficulties, but the second seemed insurmountable. 



No matter how much in sympathy with our main aim, he



could not sacrifice a possession so dear to his constituency



as the State College of Agriculture.  He felt that he had



no right to do so; he knew also that to do so would be to



sacrifice his political future, and we felt, as he did, that he



had no right to do this.







But here came in to help us the culmination of a series



of events as unexpected as that which had placed the land-



grant fund at our disposal just at the time when Mr. Cornell



and myself met in the State Senate.  For years a



considerable body of thoughtful men throughout the State,



more especially of the medical profession, had sought to



remedy a great evil in the treatment of the insane.  As far



back as the middle of the century, Senator Bradford of



Cortland had taken the lead in an investigation of the



system then existing, and his report was a frightful ex-



posure.  Throughout the State, lunatics whose families



were unable to support them at the State or private asylums



were huddled together in the poorhouses of the various



counties.  Their condition was heartrending.  They



were constantly exposed to neglect, frequently to extremes



of cold and hunger, and sometimes to brutality: thus mild



lunacy often became raving madness.  For some years before



my election to the Senate the need of a reform had



been urged upon the legislative committees by a physician



--Dr. Willard of Albany.  He had taken this evil condition



of things much to heart, and year after year had come



before the legislature urging the creation of a new



institution, which he wished named after an eminent physician



of Albany who had in his day done what was possible to



remedy the evil--Dr. Beck.  But year after year Dr.



Willard's efforts, like those of Dr. Beck before him, had



been in vain.  Session after session the ``Bill to establish



the Beck Asylum for the Chronic Insane'' was rejected,--



the legislature shrinking from the cost of it.  But one day,



as we were sitting in the Senate, appalling news came from



the Assembly:  Dr. Willard, while making one more passionate



appeal for the asylum, had fallen dead in the presence



of the committee.  The result was a deep and wide-



spread feeling of compunction, and while we were under



the influence of this I sought Judge Folger and showed him



his opportunity to do two great things.  I said:  ``It rests



with you to remedy this cruel evil which has now cost



Dr. Willard his life, and at the same time to join us in



carrying the Cornell University Bill.  Let the legislature



create a new asylum for the chronic insane of the State. 



Now is the time of all times.  Instead of calling it the



Beck Asylum, give it the name of Willard--the man who



died in advocating it.  Place it upon the Agricultural



College property on the shores of Seneca Lake in your



district.  Your constituents are sure to prefer a living



State asylum to a dying Agricultural College, and will



thoroughly support you in both the proposed measures.'' 



This suggestion Judge Folger received with favor.  The



Willard Asylum was created, and he became one of our



strongest supporters.







Both Mr. Cornell's financial plans and my educational



plans in the new university charter were wrought into



final shape by him.  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee



he reported our bill to the Senate, and at various



critical periods gave us his earnest support.  Quite likely



doctrinaires will stigmatize our conduct in this matter as



``log-rolling''; the men who always criticize but never



construct may even call it a ``bargain.''  There was



no ``bargain'' and no ``log-rolling,'' but they may call



it what they like; I believe that we were both of us



thoroughly in the right.  For our coming together in this way



gave to the State the Willard Asylum and the Cornell



University, and without our thus coming together neither



of these would have been created.







But in spite of this happy compromise, the struggle for



our university charter, as has already been seen, was long



and severe.  The opposition of over twenty sectarian colleges,



and of active politicians from every quarter of the



State where these colleges had been established, made our



work difficult; but at last it was accomplished.  Preparations



for the new institution were now earnestly pressed



on, and for a year I gave up very much of my time to them,



keeping in constant communication with Mr. Cornell,



frequently visiting Ithaca, and corresponding with trustees



in various parts of the State and with all others at home



or abroad who seemed able to throw light on any of the



problems we had to solve.







The question now arose as to the presidency of the



institution; and, as time passed on and duties increased, this



became more and more pressing.  In the previous chapter



I have given some account of the circumstances attending



my election and of Mr. Cornell's relation to it; but this is



perhaps the place for stating one of the difficulties which



stood in the way of my acceptance, and which, indeed,



greatly increased my cares during all the first years of my



presidency.  The death of my father and uncle, who had



for many years carried on a large and wide-spread business,



threw upon me new responsibilities.  It was during the



Civil War, when panic after panic ran through the American



business world, making the interests now devolving



upon me all the more burdensome.  I had no education



for business and no liking for it, but, under the pressure



of necessity, decided to do the best I could, yet determining



that just as soon as these business affairs could be turned



over to others it should be done.  Several years elapsed,



and those the busiest so far as the university was concerned,



before such a release became possible.  So it happened



that during the first and most trying years of the



new institution of Ithaca, I was obliged to do duty as



senator of the State of New York, president of Cornell



University, lecturer at the University of Michigan,



president of the National Bank of Syracuse and director in



two other banks,--one being at Oswego,--director in the



New York Central and Lake Shore railways, director in



the Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal,--to say nothing



of positions on boards of various similar corporations



and the executorship of two widely extended estates. 



It was a trying time for me.  There was, however, some



advantage; for this epoch in my life put me in relations



with some of the foremost business men in the United



States, among them Cornelius Vanderbilt, William H.



Vanderbilt, Dean Richmond, Daniel Drew, and various



other men accustomed to prompt and decisive dealing with



large business affairs.  I recognized the value of such



associations and endeavored to learn something from them,



but was determined, none the less, to end this sort of



general activity as early as it could be done consistently



with justice to my family.  Several years were required,



and those the very years in which university cares were



most pressing.  But finally my intention was fully carried



out.  The bank over which my father had presided so



many years I was able to wind up in a way satisfactory



to all concerned, not only repaying the shareholders,



but giving them a large surplus.  From the other cor-



porations also I gradually escaped, turning my duties



over to those better fitted for them.  Still many outside



cares remained, and in one way or another I was obliged



to take part in affairs which I would have gladly shunned. 



Yet there was consolation in the idea that, as my main



danger was that of drifting into a hermit life among



professors and books, anything that took me out of this for a



limited length of time was not without compensating advantages.







Just previously to my election to the university presidency



I had presented a ``plan of organization,'' which,



having been accepted and printed by the trustees, formed



the mold for the main features of the new institution; and



early among my duties came the selection and nomination



of professors.  In these days one is able to choose from a



large body of young men holding fellowships in the various



larger universities of the United States; but then, with



the possible exception of two or three at Harvard, there



was not a fellowship, so far as I can remember, in the whole



country.  The choosing of professors was immeasurably



more difficult than at present.  With reference to this point,



a very eminent graduate of Harvard then volunteered to



me some advice, which at first sight looked sound, but which



I soon found to be inapplicable.  He said:  ``You must secure



at any cost the foremost men in the United States in



every department.  In this way alone can a real university



be created.''  Trying the Socratic method upon him, I



asked, in reply, ``How are we to get such men?  The foremost



man in American science is undoubtedly Agassiz, but



he has refused all offers of high position at Paris made him



by the French Emperor.  The main objects of his life are



the creation of his great museum at Harvard and his



investigations and instruction in connection with it; he has



declared that he has `no time to waste in making money!' 



What sum or what inducement of any sort can transfer



him from Harvard to a new institution on the distant hills



of central New York?  So, too, with the most eminent



men at the other universities.  What sum will draw them



to us from Harvard, Yale, Columbia, the University of



Virginia, and the University of Michigan?  An endowment



twice as large as ours would be unavailing.''  Therefore



it was that I broached, as a practical measure, in my



``plan of organization,'' the system which I had discussed



tentatively with George William Curtis several years before,



and to which he referred afterward in his speech at



the opening of the university at Ithaca.  This was to take



into our confidence the leading professors in the more



important institutions of learning, and to secure from



them, not the ordinary, conventional paper testimonials,



but confidential information as to their young men likely



to do the best work in various fields, to call these young



men to our resident professorships, and then to call the



most eminent men we could obtain for non-resident



professorships or lectureships.  This idea was carried out to



the letter.  The most eminent men in various universities



gave us confidential advice; and thus it was that I was



enabled to secure a number of bright, active, energetic



young men as our resident professors, mingling with them



two or three older men, whose experience and developed



judgment seemed necessary in the ordinary conduct of our



affairs.







As to the other part of the plan, I secured Agassiz,



Lowell, Curtis, Bayard Taylor, Goldwin Smith, Theodore



Dwight, George W. Greene, John Stanton Gould, and at a



later period Froude, Freeman, and others, as non-resident



professors and lecturers.  Of the final working of this



system I shall speak later.







The question of buildings also arose; but, alas!  I could



not reproduce my air-castles.  For our charter required



us to have the university in operation in October, 1868,



and there was no time for careful architectural preparation. 



Moreover, the means failed us.  All that we could



then do was to accept a fairly good plan for our main



structures; to make them simple, substantial, and dignified;



to build them of stone from our own quarries; and



so to dispose them that future architects might so combine



other buildings with them as to form an impressive quadrangle



on the upper part of the university property.  To



this plan Mr. Cornell gave his hearty assent.  It was then



arranged, with his full sanction, that the university



buildings should ultimately consist of two great groups: the



first or upper group to be a quadrangle of stone, and the



second or lower group to be made up of buildings of



brick more freely disposed, according to our future needs



and means.  Although this plan has unfortunately been



departed from in some minor respects, it has in general



turned out well.







Having called a number of professors and seen foundations



laid for ``Morrill Hall,'' I sailed in April of 1868



for Europe, in order to study technical institutions, to



purchase needed equipment, and to secure certain professors



such as could not then be found in our own country. 



Thus far my knowledge of higher education in Europe



had been confined almost entirely to the universities;



but now I went carefully through various technical



institutions, among them the English Agricultural College



at Cirencester, the Agricultural Experiment Station



at Rothamstead, the French Agricultural College at



Grignon, the Conservatoire des Arts et M<e'>tiers at Paris,



the Veterinary School at Alfort, the German Agricultural



College at Hohenheim, the Technical School and



Veterinary College at Berlin, and others.  As to equipment,



wherever I found valuable material I bought it. 



Thus were brought together for our library a very large



collection of books in all the principal departments; physical



and chemical apparatus from London, Paris, Heidelberg,



and Berlin; chemicals from Berlin and Erfurt; the



only duplicate of the royal collection of cereals and grasses



and the great collection of British patent-office publications



from the British imperial authorities; the Rau models



of plows from Hohenheim; the Brendel plant models



from Breslau; the models of machine movements from



London, Darmstadt, and Berlin; the plastic models of



Auzoux from Paris; and other apparatus and instruments



from all parts of Europe, with diagrams and drawings



from every institution where I could find them.  During



three months, from funds furnished by the university, by



Mr. Cornell personally, and, I may be allowed to add, from



my own personal resources, I expended for these purposes



over sixty thousand dollars, a sum which in those days



represented much more than in these.







As to non-resident professors, I secured in London



Goldwin Smith, who had recently distinguished himself



by his works as a historian and as regius professor of



history at Oxford; and I was successful in calling Dr.



James Law, who, though a young man, had already made



himself a name in veterinary science.  It seemed to many



a comical juxtaposition, and various witticisms were made



at my expense over the statement that I had ``brought



back an Oxford professor and a Scotch horse-doctor.'' 



But never were selections more fortunate.  Goldwin Smith,



by his high character, his broad and deep scholarship, his



devotion not only to his professorship but to the general



university work, his self-denial in behalf of the university



and its students, rendered priceless services.  He bore all



privations cheerfully and braved all discouragements



manfully.  Never were there better historical lectures than his. 



They inspired us all, and the impulse then given is still



felt.  So, too, Dr. Law, in his field, was invaluable, and this



was soon felt throughout the State.  Of him I shall speak



later.















CHAPTER XX







THE FIRST YEARS OF CORNELL UNIVERSITY--1868-1870







On the 7th of October, 1868, came the formal opening



of the university.  The struggle for its charter



had attracted much attention in all parts of the State, and



a large body of spectators, with about four hundred



students, assembled at the Cornell Library Hall in Ithaca. 



Though the charter had required us to begin in October,



there had seemed for some time very little chance of



it.  Mr. Cornell had been absent in the woods of the upper



Mississippi and on the plains of Kansas, selecting university



lands; I had been absent for some months in Europe,



securing plans and equipment; and as, during our absence,



the contractor for the first main building, Morrill Hall, had



failed, the work was wretchedly behindhand.  The direct



roads to the university site were as yet impracticable, for



the Cascadilla ravine and the smaller one north of it were



still unbridged.  The grounds were unkempt, with heaps



of earth and piles of material in all directions.  The great



quantities of furniture, apparatus, and books which I had



sent from Europe had been deposited wherever storage



could be found.  Typical was the case of the large Holtz



electrical machine from Germany.  It was in those days a



novelty, and many were anxious to see it; but it could not



be found, and it was only discovered several weeks later,



when the last pots and pans were pulled out of the kitchen



store-room in the cellar of the great stone barrack known



as Cascadilla House.  All sorts of greatly needed material



had been delayed in steamships and on railways, or was



stuck fast in custom-houses and warehouses from Berlin



and Paris to Ithaca.  Our friends had toiled heroically



during our absence, but the little town--then much



less energetic than now--had been unable to furnish



the work required in so short a time.  The heating



apparatus and even the doors for the students' rooms were



not in place until weeks after winter weather had set in.  To



complicate matters still more, students began to come at



a period much earlier and in numbers far greater than we



had expected; and the first result of this was that, in



getting ready for the opening, Mr. Cornell and myself were



worn out.  For two or three days before my inauguration



both of us were in the hands of physicians and in bed, and



on the morning of the day appointed we were taken in



carriages to the hall where the ceremony was to take place. 



To Mr. Cornell's brief speech I have alluded elsewhere;



my own presented my ideas more at length.  They were



grouped in four divisions.  The first of these related to



``Foundation Ideas,'' which were announced as follows: 



First, the close union of liberal and practical instruction;



second, unsectarian control; third, a living union between



the university and the whole school system of the State;



fourth, concentration of revenues for advanced education. 



The second division was that of ``Formative Ideas''; and



under these--First, equality between different courses of



study.  In this I especially developed ideas which had



occurred to me as far back as my observations after



graduation at Yale, where the classical students belonging



to the ``college proper'' were given a sort of supremacy,



and scientific students relegated to a separate institution



at considerable distance, and therefore deprived of much



general, and even special, culture which would have



greatly benefited them.  Indeed, they seemed not considered



as having any souls to be saved, since no provision



was made for them at the college chapel.  Second, increased



development of scientific studies.  The third main division



was that of ``Governmental Ideas''; and under these--



First, ``the regular and frequent infusion of new life into



the governing board.''  Here a system at that time entirely



new in the United States was proposed.  Instead of the



usual life tenure of trustees, their term was made five years



and they were to be chosen by ballot.  Secondly, it was



required that as soon as the graduates of the university



numbered fifty they should select one trustee each year,



thus giving the alumni one third of the whole number



elected.  Third, there was to be a system of self-government



administered by the students themselves.  As to this



third point, I must frankly confess that my ideas were



vague, unformed, and finally changed by the logic of



events.  As the fourth and final main division, I presented



``Permeating Ideas''; and of these--First, the development



of the individual man in all his nature, in all his



powers, as a being intellectual, moral, and religious. 



Secondly, bringing the powers of the man thus developed



to bear usefully upon society.







In conclusion, I alluded to two groups of ``Eliminated



Ideas,'' the first of these being the ``Ideas of the Pedants,''



and the second the ``Ideas of the Philistines.''  As to the



former, I took pains to guard the institution from those



who, in the higher education, substitute dates for history,



gerund-grinding for literature, and formulas for science;



as to the latter, I sought to guard it from the men to whom



``Gain is God, and Gunnybags his Prophet.''







At the close, referring to Mr. Cornell, who had been too



weak to stand while delivering his speech, and who was at



that moment sitting near me, I alluded to his noble plans



and to the opposition, misrepresentation, and obloquy he



had met thus far, and in doing so turned toward him.  The



sight of him, as he thus sat, looking so weak, so weary, so



broken, for a few moments utterly incapacitated me.  I



was myself, at the time, in but little better condition than



he; and as there rushed into my mind memories of the previous



ten days at his house, when I had heard him groaning



in pain through almost every night, it flashed upon me



how utterly hopeless was the university without his



support.  My voice faltered; I could for a moment say no-



thing; then came a revulsion.  I asked myself, ``What will



this great audience think of us?''  How will our enemies,



some of whom I see scattered about the audience, exult



over this faltering at the outset!  A feeling of shame came



over me; but just at that moment I saw two or three strong



men from different parts of the State, among them my old



friend Mr. Sedgwick of Syracuse, in the audience, and Mr.



Sage and Mr. McGraw among the trustees, evidently



affected by my allusion to the obloquy and injustice which



Mr. Cornell had met thus far.  This roused me.  But



I could no longer read; I laid my manuscript aside and



gave the ending in words which occurred to me as I



stood then and there.  They were faltering and inadequate;



but I felt that the vast majority in that audience,



representing all parts of our commonwealth, were with



us, and I asked nothing more.







In the afternoon came exercises at the university



grounds.  The chime of nine bells which Miss Jenny



McGraw had presented to us had been temporarily hung



in a wooden tower placed very near the spot where now



stands the porch of the library; and, before the bells were



rung for the first time, a presentation address was delivered



by Mr. Francis Miles Finch, since justice of the Court



of Appeals of the State and dean of the University Law



School; and this was followed by addresses from the



superintendent of public instruction, and from our non-



resident professors Agassiz and George William Curtis.







Having again been taken out of bed and wrapped up



carefully, I was carried up the hill to hear them.  All the



speeches were fine; but, just at the close, Curtis burst into



a peroration which, in my weak physical condition, utterly



unmanned me.  He compared the new university to a



newly launched ship--``all its sails set, its rigging full and



complete from stem to stern, its crew embarked, its



passengers on board; and,'' he added, ``even while I speak



to you, even while this autumn sun sets in the west, the



ship begins to glide over the waves, it goes forth rejoicing,



every stitch of canvas spread, all its colors flying, its



bells ringing, its heart-strings beating with hope and



joy; and I say, God bless the ship, God bless the builder,



God bless the chosen captain, God bless the crew, and,



gentlemen undergraduates, may God bless all the passengers!''







The audience applauded; the chimes burst merrily



forth; but my heart sank within me.  A feeling of ``goneness''



came over me.  Curtis's simile was so perfect that



I felt myself indeed on the deck of the ship, but not so much



in the character of its ``chosen captain'' as of a seasick



passenger.  There was indeed reason for qualmish feelings. 



Had I drawn a picture of the ship at that moment,



it would have been very different from that presented by



Curtis.  My mind was pervaded by our discouragements--



by a realization of Mr. Cornell's condition and my own,



the demands of our thoughtless friends, the attacks of our



fanatical enemies, the inadequacy of our resources.  The



sense of all these things burst upon me, and the view about



us was not reassuring.  Not only were the university buildings



unready and the grounds unkempt, but all that part



of our domain which is now devoted to the beautiful lawns



about the university chapel, Barnes Hall, Sage College,



and other stately edifices, was then a ragged corn-field



surrounded by rail fences.  No one knew better than I



the great difficulties which were sure to beset us. 



Probably no ship was ever launched in a condition so unfit to



brave the storms.  Even our lesser difficulties, though they



may appear comical now, were by no means comical then. 



As a rule, Mr. Cornell had consulted me before making



communications to the public; but during my absence in



Europe he had written a letter to the ``New York Tribune,''



announcing that students could support themselves,



while pursuing their studies one half of each day in the



university, by laboring the other half.  In this he showed



that sympathy with needy and meritorious young men



which was one of his marked qualities, but his proclamation



cost us dear.  He measured the earnestness and endurance



and self-sacrifice of others by his own; he did not



realize that not one man in a thousand was, in these



respects, his equal.  As a result of this ``Tribune'' letter, a



multitude of eager young men pressed forward at the



opening of the university and insisted on receiving self-



supporting work.  Nearly all of those who could offer



skilled labor of any sort we were able to employ; and



many graduates of whom Cornell University is now proud



supported themselves then by working as carpenters, masons,



printers, accountants, and shorthand-writers.  But



besides these were many who had never done any manual



labor, and still more who had never done any labor



requiring skill.  An attempt was made to employ these in



grading roads, laying out paths, helping on the farm,



doing janitors' work, and the like.  Some of them were



successful; most were not.  It was found that it would be



cheaper to support many of the applicants at a hotel and to



employ day-laborers in their places.  Much of their work



had to be done over again at a cost greater than the original



outlay should have been.  Typical was the husking of



Indian corn upon the university farm by student labor: it



was found to cost more than the resultant corn could be



sold for in the market.  The expectations of these youth



were none the less exuberant.  One of them, who had never



done any sort of manual labor, asked whether, while learning



to build machinery and supporting himself and his



family, he could not lay up something against contingencies. 



Another, a teamster from a Western State, came to



offer his services, and, on being asked what he wished to



study, said that he wished to learn to read; on being told



that the public school in his own district was the place for



that, he was very indignant, and quoted Mr. Cornell's



words, ``I would found an institution where any person can



find instruction in any study.''  Others, fairly good scholars,



but of delicate build, having applied for self-supporting



employment, were assigned the lightest possible tasks



upon the university grounds; but, finding even this work



too severe, wrote bitterly to leading metropolitan journals



denouncing Mr. Cornell's bad faith.  One came all the way



from Russia, being able to make the last stages of his



journey only by charity, and on arriving was found to be



utterly incapable of sustained effort, physical or mental. 



The most definite part of his aims, as he announced them,



was to convert the United States to the Russo-Greek



Church.







Added to these were dreamers and schemers of more



mature age.  The mails were burdened with their letters



and our offices with their presence.  Some had plans for



the regeneration of humanity by inventing machines which



they wished us to build, some by devising philosophies



which they wished us to teach, some by writing books



which they wished us to print; most by taking professorships



which they wished us to endow.  The inevitable politician



also appeared; and at the first meeting of the trustees



two notorious party hacks came all the way from New



York to tell us ``what the people expected,''--which was



the nomination of sundry friends of theirs to positions in



the new institution.  A severe strain was brought upon



Mr. Cornell and myself in showing civility to these gentlemen;



yet, as we were obliged to deny them, no suavity



on our part could stay the inevitable result--their



hostility.  The attacks of the denominational and local presses



in the interests of institutions which had failed to tear the



fund in pieces and to secure scraps of it were thus largely



reinforced.  Ever and anon came onslaughts upon us



personally and upon every feature of the institution, whether



actual, probable, possible, or conceivable.  One eminent



editorial personage, having vainly sought to ``unload'' a



member of his staff into one of our professorships, howled



in a long article at the turpitude of Mr. Cornell in land



matters, screamed for legislative investigation, and for



years afterward never neglected an opportunity to strike



a blow at the new institution.







Some difficulties also showed themselves in the first



working of our university machinery.  In my ``plan of



organization,'' as well as in various addresses and reports,



I had insisted that the university should present various



courses of instruction, general and special, and that



students should be allowed much liberty of choice between



these.  This at first caused serious friction.  It has



disappeared, now that the public schools of the State have



adjusted themselves to the proper preparation of students



for the various courses; but at that time these



difficulties were in full force and vigor.  One of the most



troublesome signs of this was the changing and shifting



by students from course to course, which both injured



them and embarrassed their instructors.  To meet this



tendency I not only addressed the students to show



that good, substantial, continuous work on any one course



which any one of them was likely to choose was far



better than indecision and shifting about between various



courses, but also reprinted for their use John Foster's



famous ``Essay on Decision of Character.''  This tractate



had done me much good in my student days and at various



times since, when I had allowed myself to linger too long



between different courses of action; and I now distributed



it freely, the result being that students generally made



their election between courses with increased care, and



when they had made it stood by it.







Yet for these difficulties in getting the student body



under way there were compensations, and best of these



was the character and bearing of the students.  There



were, of course, sundry exhibitions of boyishness, but the



spirit of the whole body was better than that of any



similar collection of young men I had ever seen.  One reason



was that we were happily spared any large proportion of



rich men's sons, but the main reason was clearly the



permission of choice between various courses of study in



accordance with individual aims and tastes.  In this way



a far larger number were interested than had ever been



under the old system of forcing all alike through one



simple, single course, regardless of aims and tastes; and



thus it came that, even from the first, the tone at Cornell



was given, not by men who affected to despise study, but



by men who devoted themselves to study.  It evidently



became disreputable for any student not to be really at



work in some one of the many courses presented.  There



were few cases really calling for discipline.  I prized this



fact all the more because it justified a theory of mine.  I



had long felt that the greatest cause of student turbulence



and dissipation was the absence of interest in study



consequent upon the fact that only one course was provided,



and I had arrived at the conclusion that providing various



courses, suited to various aims and tastes, would diminish



this evil.







As regards student discipline in the university, I had



dwelt in my ``plan of organization'' upon the advisability



of a departure from the system inherited from the English



colleges, which was still widely prevailing.  It had been



developed in America probably beyond anything known



in Great Britain and Germany, and was far less satisfactory



than in these latter countries, for the simple reason



that in them the university authorities have some legal



power to secure testimony and administer punishment,



while in America they have virtually none.  The result had



been most unfortunate, as I have shown in other parts of



these chapters referring to various student escapades in the



older American universities, some of them having cost human



life.  I had therefore taken the ground that, so far as



possible, students should be treated as responsible citizens;



that, as citizens, they should be left to be dealt with by the



constituted authorities; and that members of the faculty



should no longer be considered as policemen.  I had, during



my college life, known sundry college tutors seriously



injured while thus doing police duty; I have seen a



professor driven out of a room, through the panel of a door,



with books, boots, and bootjacks hurled at his head; and



even the respected president of a college, a doctor of



divinity, while patrolling buildings with the janitors,



subjected to outrageous indignity.







Fortunately the causes already named, to which may be



added athletic sports, especially boating, so greatly



diminished student mischief at Cornell, that cases of discipline



were reduced to a minimum--so much so, in fact, that there



were hardly ever any of a serious character.  I felt that



then and there was the time to reiterate the doctrine laid



down in my ``plan of organization,'' that a professor



should not be called upon to be a policeman, and that if the



grounds were to be policed, proper men should be employed



for that purpose.  This doctrine was reasonable



and it prevailed.  The Cornell grounds and buildings,



under the care of a patrol appointed for that purpose,



have been carefully guarded, and never has a member of



the faculty been called upon to perform police duty.







There were indeed some cases requiring discipline by



the faculty, and one of these will provoke a smile on the



part of all who took part in it as long as they shall live. 



There had come to us a stalwart, sturdy New Englander,



somewhat above the usual student age, and showing



considerable aptitude for studies in engineering.  Various



complaints were made against him; but finally he was



summoned before the faculty for a very singular breach



of good taste, if not of honesty.  The entire instructing



body of that day being gathered about the long table in



the faculty room, and I being at the head of the table, the



culprit was summoned, entered, and stood solemnly before



us.  Various questions were asked him, which he



parried with great ingenuity.  At last one was asked



of a very peculiar sort, as follows:  ``Mr. ----, did you,



last month, in the village of Dundee, Yates County, pass



yourself off as Professor ---- of this university,



announcing a lecture and delivering it in his name?''  He



answered blandly, ``Sir, I did go to Dundee in Yates County;



I did deliver a lecture there; I did NOT announce myself as



Professor ---- of Cornell University; what others may



have done I do not know; all I know is that at the close



of my lecture several leading men of the town came



forward and said that they had heard a good many lectures



given by college professors from all parts of the State,



and that they had never had one as good as mine.''  I



think, of all the strains upon my risible faculties during



my life, this answer provoked the greatest, and the



remainder of the faculty were clearly in the same condition. 



I dismissed the youth at once, and hardly was he outside



the door when a burst of titanic laughter shook the court



and the youth was troubled no more.







Far more serious was another case.  The usual good-



natured bickering between classes had gone on, and as a



consequence certain sophomores determined to pay off



some old scores against members of the junior class, at a



junior exhibition.  To do this they prepared a ``mock



programme,'' which, had it been merely comic, as some



others had been, would have provoked no ill feeling. 



Unfortunately, some miscreant succeeded in introducing into



it allusions of a decidedly Rabelaisian character.  The



evening arrived, a large audience of ladies and gentlemen



were assembled, and this programme was freely distributed. 



The proceeding was felt to be an outrage; and I



served notice on the class that the real of offender or



offenders, if they wished to prevent serious consequences to all



concerned, must submit themselves to the faculty and take



due punishment.  Unfortunately, they were not manly



enough to do this.  Thereupon, to my own deep regret and



in obedience to my sense of justice, I suspended indefinitely



from the university the four officers of the class,



its president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer. 



They were among the very best men in the class, all



of them friends of my own; and I knew to a certainty



that they had had nothing directly to do with the articles



concerned, that the utmost which could be said against



them was that they had been careless as to what appeared



in the programme, for which they were responsible.  Most



bitter feeling arose, and I summoned a meeting of the



entire student body.  As I entered the room hisses were



heard; the time had evidently come for a grapple with



the whole body.  I stated the case as it was: that the four



officers would be suspended and must leave the university



town until their return was allowed by the faculty; that



such an offense against decency could not be condoned;



that I had understood that the entire class proposed to



make common cause with their officers and leave the



university with them; that to this we interposed no objection;



that it simply meant less work for the faculty during the



remainder of the year; that it was far more important



for the university to maintain a character for decency and



good discipline than to have a large body of students; and



that, if necessary to maintain such a character, we would



certainly allow the whole student body in all the classes to



go home and would begin anew.  I then drew a picture. 



I sketched a member of the class who had left the university



on account of this discipline entering the paternal



door, encountering a question as to the cause of his



unexpected home-coming, and replying that the cause was the



outrageous tyranny of the president and faculty.  I



pictured, then, the father and mother of the home-coming



student asking what the cause or pretext of this ``tyranny''



was, and I then said:  ``I defy any one of you to show your



father and mother the `mock programme' which has



caused the trouble.  There is not one of you here who dares



do it; there is not one of you who would not be turned out



of his father's door if he were thus to insult his mother.'' 



At this there came a round of applause.  I then expressed



my personal regret that the penalty must fall upon four



men whom I greatly respected; but fall it must unless



the offenders were manly enough to give themselves



up.  The result was that at the close I was greeted with a



round of applause; and immediately afterward the four



officers came to me, acknowledged the justice of the



discipline, and expressed the hope that their suspension might



not go beyond that term.  It did not: at the close of the



term they were allowed to return; and from that day



``mock programmes'' of the sort concerned, which in many



American colleges had been a chronic evil, never



reappeared at Cornell.  The result of this action encouraged



me greatly as to the reliance to be placed on the sense of



justice in the great body of our students when directly



and properly appealed to.







Still another thing which I sought to promote was a



reasonable devotion to athletics.  My own experience as



a member of a boating-club at Yale had shown me what



could be done, and I think one of the best investments I



ever made was in giving a racing-boat to the Cornell crew



on Cayuga Lake.  The fact that there were so many



students trained sturdily in rural homes in the bracing



air of western New York, who on every working-day of



college life tramped up the University Hill, and on other



days explored the neighboring hills and vales, gave us a



body of men sure to do well as athletes.  At their first



contest with the other universities on the Connecticut



River at Springfield they were beaten, but they took their



defeat manfully.  Some time after this, General Grant,



then President of the United States, on his visit to the



university, remarked to me that he saw the race at Springfield;



that our young men ought to have won it; and that,



in his opinion, they would have won it if they had not



been unfortunately placed in shallow water, where there



were eddies making against them.  This remark struck



me forcibly, coming as it did from one who had so keen a



judgment in every sort of contest.  I bore it in mind, and



was not surprised when, a year or two later (1875), the



Cornell crews, having met at Saratoga Lake the crews



from Harvard, Yale, and other leading universities, won



both the freshman and university races.  It was humorously



charged against me that when the news of this



reached Ithaca I rang the university bells.  This was not



the fact.  The simple truth was that, being in the midst



of a body of students when the news came, and seeing them



rush toward the bell-tower, I went with them to prevent



injury to the bells by careless ringing; the ringing was



done by them.  I will not deny that the victory pleased me,



as many others since gained by the Cornell crews have



done; but far more to me than the victory itself was a



letter written me by a prominent graduate of Princeton



who was at Saratoga during the contest.  He wrote me, as



he said, not merely to congratulate me on the victory, but



on the fine way in which our students took it, and the manly



qualities which they showed in the hour of triumph and



during their whole stay at Saratoga.  This gave me courage. 



From that day I have never felt any fears as to the



character of the student body.  One leading cause of the



success of Cornell University, in the midst of all its trials



and struggles, has been the character of its students:



working as they do under a system which gives them an



interest in the studies they are pursuing, they have used



the large liberty granted them in a way worthy of all praise.







Nor is this happy change seen at Cornell alone.  The



same causes,--mainly the increase in the range of studies



and freedom of choice between them, have produced similar



results in all the leading institutions.  Recalling the



student brawl at the Harvard commons which cost the



historian Prescott his sight, and the riot at the Harvard



commencement which blocked the way of President Everett



and the British minister; recalling the fatal wounding



of Tutor Dwight, the maiming of Tutor Goodrich, and



the killing of two town rioters by students at Yale; and



recalling the monstrous indignities to the president and



faculty at Hobart of which I was myself witness, as well



as the state of things at various other colleges in my own



college days, I can testify, as can so many others, to the vast



improvement in the conduct and aims of American students



during the latter half of the nineteenth century.















CHAPTER XXI







DIFFICULTIES AND DANGERS AT CORNELL--1868-1872







The first business after formally opening the university



was to put in operation the various courses of



instruction, and vitally connected with these were the



lectures of our non-resident professors.  From these I had



hoped much and was not disappointed.  It had long seemed



to me that a great lack in our American universities was



just that sort of impulse which non-resident professors



or lecturers of a high order could give.  At Yale there had



been, in my time, very few lectures of any sort to



undergraduates; the work in the various classes was carried on,



as a rule, without the slightest enthusiasm, and was



considered by the great body of students a bore to be abridged



or avoided as far as possible.  Hence such pranks as



cutting out the tongue of the college bell, of which two or



three tongues still preserved in university club-rooms are



reminders; hence, also, the effort made by members of my



own class to fill the college bell with cement, which would



set in a short time, and make any call to morning prayers



and recitations for a day or two impossible--a performance



which caused a long suspension of several of the best



young fellows that ever lived, some of them good scholars,



and all of them men who would have walked miles to attend



a really inspiring lecture.







And yet, one or two experiences showed me what might



be done by arousing an interest in regular class work. 



Professor Thacher, the head of the department of Latin,



who conducted my class through the ``Germania'' and



``Agricola'' of Tacitus, was an excellent professor; but



he yielded to the system then dominant at Yale, and the



whole thing was but weary plodding.  Hardly ever was



there anything in the shape of explanation or comment;



but at the end of his work with us he laid down the book,



and gave us admirably the reasons why the study of



Tacitus was of value, and why we might well recur to it



in after years.  Then came painfully into my mind the



thought, ``What a pity that he had not said this at the



beginning of his instruction rather than at the end!''







Still worse was it with some of the tutors, who took us



through various classical works, but never with a particle



of appreciation for them as literature or philosophy.  I



have told elsewhere how my classmate Smalley fought it



out with one of these.  No instruction from outside



lectures was provided; but in my senior year there came to



New Haven John Lord and George William Curtis, the



former giving a course on modern history, the latter



one upon recent literature, and both arousing my earnest



interest in their subjects.  It was in view of these



experiences that in my ``plan of organization'' I dwelt



especially upon the value of non-resident professors in



bringing to us fresh life from the outside, and in thus



preventing a certain provincialism and woodenness which



come when there are only resident professors, and these



selected mainly from graduates of the institution itself.







The result of the work done by our non-resident



professors more than answered my expectations.  The twenty



lectures of Agassiz drew large numbers of our brightest



young men, gave them higher insight into various problems



of natural science, and stimulated among many



a zeal for special investigation.  Thus resulted an



enthusiasm which developed out of our student body several



scholars in natural science who have since taken rank



among the foremost teachers and investigators in the



United States.  So, too, the lectures of Lowell on early



literature and of Curtis on later literature aroused great



interest among students of a more literary turn; while



those of Theodore Dwight on the Constitution of the



United States and of Bayard Taylor upon German literature



awakened a large number of active minds to the



beauties of these fields.  The coming of Goldwin Smith



was an especial help to us.  He remained longer than the



others; in fact, he became for two or three years a resident



professor, exercising, both in his lecture-room and out of



it, a great influence upon the whole life of the university. 



At a later period, the coming of George W. Greene as



lecturer on American history, of Edward A. Freeman,



regius professor at Oxford, as a lecturer on European



history, and of James Anthony Froude in the same field,



aroused new interest.  Some of our experiences with the



two gentlemen last named were curious.  Freeman was a



rough diamond--in his fits of gout very rough indeed.  At



some of his lectures he appeared clad in a shooting-jacket



and spoke sitting, his foot swathed to mitigate his



sufferings.  From New Haven came a characteristic story of



him.  He had been invited to attend an evening gathering,



after one of his lectures, at the house of one of the



professors, perhaps the finest residence in the town.  With



the exception of himself, the gentlemen all arrived in



evening dress; he appeared in a shooting-jacket.  Presently



two professors arrived; and one of them, glancing



through the rooms, and seeing Freeman thus attired, asked



the other, ``What sort of a costume do you call that?''  The



answer came instantly, ``I don't know, unless it is the



costume of a Saxon swineherd before the Conquest.''  In



view of Freeman's studies on the Saxon and Norman



periods and the famous toast of the dean of Wells, ``In



honor of Professor Freeman, who has done so much to



reveal to us the rude manners of our ancestors,'' the Yale



professor's answer seemed much to the point.







The lectures of Froude were exceedingly interesting;



but every day he began them with the words ``Ladies and



gentlemen,'' in the most comical falsetto imaginable,--



a sort of Lord Dundreary manner,--so that, sitting



beside him, I always noticed a ripple of laughter run-



ning over the whole audience, which instantly disappeared



as he settled into his work.  He had a way of



giving color to his lectures by citing bits of humorous



history.  Thus it was that he threw a vivid light on the



horrors of civil war in Ireland during the sixteenth and



seventeenth centuries, when he gave the plea of an Irish



chieftain on trial for high treason, one of the charges



against him being that he had burned the Cathedral of



Cashel.  His plea was:  ``Me lords, I niver would have



burned the cathaydral but that I supposed that his grace



the lord archbishop was inside.''







Speaking of the strength of the clan spirit, he told me a



story of the late Duke of Argyll, as follows:  At a banquet



of the great clan of which the duke was chief, a splendid



snuff-box belonging to one of the clansmen, having



attracted attention, was passed round the long table for



inspection.  By and by it was missing.  All attempts to trace it



were in vain, and the party broke up in disgust and distress



at the thought that one of their number must be a thief. 



Some days afterward, the duke, putting on his dress-coat,



found the box in his pocket, and immediately sent for the



owner and explained the matter.  ``I knew ye had it,'' said



the owner.  ``How did ye know it?'' said the duke.  ``Saw



ye tak' it.''  ``Then why did n't ye tell me?'' asked the



duke.  ``I thocht ye wanted it,'' was the answer.







Speaking of university life, Froude told the story of an



Oxford undergraduate who, on being examined in Paley,



was asked to name any instance which he had himself



noticed of the goodness and forethought of the Almighty as



evidenced in his works: to which the young man answered,



``The formation of the head of a bulldog.  Its nose is so



drawn back that it can hang on the bull and yet breathe



freely; but for this, the bulldog would soon have to let



go for want of breath.''







Walking one day with Froude, I spoke to him regarding



his ``Nemesis of Faith,'' which I had read during my



attach<e'>ship at St. Petersburg, and which had been greatly



objected to by various Oxford dons, one of whom is said to



have burned a copy of it publicly in one of the college



quadrangles.  He seemed somewhat dismayed at my question,



and said, in a nervous sort of way, ``That was a



young man's book--a young man's folly,'' and passed



rapidly to other subjects.







From the stimulus given by the non-resident professors



the resident faculty reaped much advantage.  It might



well be said that the former shook the bush and the latter



caught the birds.  What is most truthfully stated on the



tablet to Professor Agassiz in the Cornell Memorial Chapel



of the university might, in great part, be said of all the



others.  It runs as follows:







``To the memory of Louis Agassiz, LL.D.  In the midst



of great labors for science, throughout the world, he



aided in laying the foundations of instruction at Cornell



University, and, by his teachings here, gave an impulse to



scientific studies, which remains a precious heritage.  The



trustees, in gratitude for his counsels and teachings, erect



this memorial.  1884.''







An incidental benefit of the system was its happy



influence upon the resident professors.  Coming from



abroad, and of recognized high position, the non-residents



brought a very happy element to our social life.  No



veteran of our faculty is likely to forget the charm they



diffused among us.  To meet Agassiz socially was a delight;



nor was it less a pleasure to sit at table with Lowell



or Curtis.  Of the many good stories told us by Lowell, I



remember one especially.  During a stay in Paris he dined



with Sainte-Beuve, and took occasion to ask that most



eminent of French critics which he thought the greater



poet, Lamartine or Victor Hugo.  Sainte-Beuve, shrugging



his shoulders, replied:  ``Eh bien, charlatan pour



charlatan, je pref<e!>re Lamartine.''  This provoked another



story, which was that, being asked by an American



professor whether in his opinion the Empire of Napoleon



III was likely to endure, Sainte-Beuve, who was a



salaried senator of the Empire, answered with a shrug,



``Monsieur, je suis pay<e'> pour le croire.''  Agassiz also



interested me by showing me the friendly, confidential, and



familiar letters which he was then constantly receiving



from the Emperor of Brazil, Dom Pedro--letters in which



not only matters of science but of contemporary history



were discussed.  Bayard Taylor also delighted us all. 



Nothing could exceed, as a provocative to mirth, his



recitations of sundry poems whose inspiration was inferior to



their ambition.  One especially brought down the house--



``The Eonx of Ruby,'' by a poet who had read Poe and



Browning until he never hesitated to coin any word, no



matter how nonsensical, which seemed likely to help his



jingle.  In many respects the most charming of all the



newcomers was Goldwin Smith, whose stories, observations,



reflections, deeply suggestive, humorous, and witty, were



especially grateful at the close of days full of work and



care.  His fund of anecdotes was large.  One of them



illustrated the fact that even those who are best acquainted



with a language not their own are in constant danger of



making themselves ridiculous in using it.  The Duc



d'Aumale, who had lived long in England, and was supposed



to speak English like an Englishman, presiding at a dinner



of the British Association for the Advancement of Science,



gave a toast as follows:  ``De tree of science, may it



shed down pease upon de nations.''







Another story related to Sir Allan MacNab, who, while



commander of the forces in Canada, having received a



card inscribed, ``The MacNab,'' immediately returned the



call, and left a card on which was inscribed, ``The other



MacNab.''







As I revise these lines, thirty-six years after his first



coming, he is visiting me again to lay the corner-stone of



the noble building which is to commemorate his services



to Cornell.  Though past his eightieth year, his memory



constantly brings up new reminiscences.  One of these I



cannot forbear giving.  He was at a party given by Lady



Ashburton when Thomas Carlyle was present.  During



the evening, which was beautiful, the guests went out upon



the lawn, and gazed at the starry heavens.  All seemed



especially impressed by the beauty of the moon, which



was at the full, when Carlyle, fastening his eyes upon it,



was heard to croak out, solemnly and bitterly, ``Puir auld



creetur!''







The instruction of the university was at that time divided



between sundry general courses and various technical



departments, the whole being somewhat tentative.  These



general courses were mainly three: the arts course,



which embraced both Latin and Greek; the course in



literature, which embraced Latin and modern languages;



and the course in science, which embraced more especially



modern languages in connection with a somewhat extended



range of scientific studies.  Of these general divisions the



one most in danger of shipwreck seemed to be the first. 



It had been provided for in the congressional act of



1862, evidently by an afterthought, and it was generally



felt that if, in the storms besetting us, anything must be



thrown overboard, it would be this; but an opportunity



now arose for clenching it into our system.  There was



offered for sale the library of Professor Charles Anthon



of Columbia, probably the largest and best collection



in classical philology which had then been brought



together in the United States.  Discussing the situation



with Mr. Cornell, I showed him the danger of restricting



the institution to purely scientific and technical



studies, and of thus departing from the university ideal. 



He saw the point, and purchased the Anthon library for



us.  Thenceforth it was felt that, with such a means of



instruction, from such a source, the classical department



must stand firm; that it must on no account be sacrificed;



that, by accepting this gift, we had pledged ourselves to



maintain it.







Yet, curiously, one of the most bitter charges constantly



reiterated against us was that we were depreciating



the study of ancient classical literature.  Again and



again it was repeated, especially in a leading daily journal



of the metropolis under the influence of a sectarian



college, that I was ``degrading classical studies.''  No-



thing could be more unjust; I had greatly enjoyed such



studies myself, had found pleasure in them since my



graduation, and had steadily urged them upon those who



had taste or capacity for them.  But, as a student and as a



university instructor, I had noticed two things in point,



as many other observers had done: the first of these was



that very many youths who go through their Latin and



Greek Readers, and possibly one or two minor authors



besides, exhaust the disciplinary value of such studies, and



thenceforward pursue them listlessly and perfunctorily,



merely droning over them.  On their account it seemed



certainly far better to present some other courses of study in



which they could take an interest.  As a matter of fact, I



constantly found that many young men who had been doing



half-way mental labor, which is perhaps worse than



none, were at once brightened and strengthened by devoting



themselves to other studies more in accordance with



their tastes and aims.







But a second and very important point was that, in



the two colleges of which I had been an undergraduate,



classical studies were really hampered and discredited



by the fact that the minority of students who loved



them were constantly held back by a majority who disliked



them; and I came to the conclusion that the true



way to promote such studies in the United States was



to take off this drag as much as possible, by presenting



other courses of studies which would attract those who



had no taste for Latin and Greek, thus leaving those who



had a taste for them free to carry them much farther than



had been customary in American universities up to that



time.  My expectations in this respect were fully met.  A



few years after the opening of the university, contests



were arranged between several of the leading colleges and



universities, the main subjects in the competition being



Latin, Greek, and mathematics; and to the confusion of



the gainsayers, Cornell took more first prizes in these



subjects than did all the older competing institutions



together.  Thenceforward the talk of our ``degrading clas-



sical studies'' was less serious.  The history of such studies



at Cornell since that time has fully justified the policy



then pursued.  Every competent observer will, I feel sure,



say that at no other American institution have these



studies been pursued with more earnestness or with better



results.  The Museum of Classical Archaeology, which has



since been founded by the generous gift of Mr. Sage, has



stimulated an increased interest in them; and graduates



of Cornell are now exercising a wide influence in classical



teaching: any one adequately acquainted with the history



of American education knows what the influence of Cornell



has been in bettering classical instruction throughout



the State of New York.  There has been another incidental



gain.  Among the melancholy things of college life in the



old days was the relation of students to classical



professors.  The majority of the average class looked on such



a professor as generally a bore and, as examinations



approached, an enemy; they usually sneered at him as a



pedant, and frequently made his peculiarities a subject for



derision.  Since that day far better relations have grown up



between teachers and taught, especially in those institutions



where much is left to the option of the students.  The students



in each subject, being those who are really interested



in it, as a rule admire and love their professor, and whatever



little peculiarities he may have are to them but pleasing



accompaniments of his deeper qualities.  This is a perfectly



simple and natural result, which will be understood



fully by any one who has observed human nature to much



purpose.







Besides this course in arts, in which classical studies



were especially prominent, there were established courses



in science, in literature, and in philosophy, differing from



each other mainly in the proportion observed between



ancient languages, modern languages, and studies in various



sciences and other departments of thought.  Each of



these courses was laid down with much exactness for the



first two years, with large opportunity for choice between



subjects in the last two years.  The system worked well,



and has, from time to time, been modified, as the improvement



in the schools of the State, and other circumstances



have required.







In proposing these courses I was much influenced by



an idea broached in Herbert Spencer's ``Treatise on



Education.''  This idea was given in his discussion of the



comparative values of different studies, when he arrived



at the conclusion that a subject which ought to be among



those taught at the beginning of every course is human



physiology,--that is to say, an account of the structure,



functions, and proper management of the human body, on



which so much depends for every human being.  It seemed



to me that not only was there great force in Spencer's



argument, but that there was an additional reason for



placing physiology among the early studies of most of



the courses; and this was that it formed a very good



beginning for scientific study in general.  An observation



of my own strengthened me in this view.  I remembered



that, during my school life, while my tastes were in the



direction of classical and historical studies, the weekly



visits to the school by the surgeon who lectured upon the



human eye, ear, and sundry other organs, using models



and preparations, interested me intensely, and were a real



relief from other studies.  There was still another reason. 



For the professorship in this department Professor Agassiz



had recommended to me Dr. Burt Wilder; and I soon



found him, as Agassiz had foretold, not only a thorough



investigator, but an admirable teacher.  His lectures were



not read, but were, as regards phrasing, extemporaneous;



and it seemed to me that, mingled with other studies, a



course of lectures given in so good a style, by so gifted a



man, could not fail to be of great use in teaching our



students, incidentally, the best way of using the English



language in communicating their ideas to their fellowmen. 



I had long deplored the rhetorical fustian and oratorical



tall-talk which so greatly afflict our country, and



which had been, to a considerable extent, cultivated in our



colleges and universities; I determined to try, at least,



to substitute for it clean, clear, straightforward statement



and illustration; and it seemed to me that a course of



lectures on a subject which admitted neither fustian nor



tall-talk, by a clear-headed, clear-voiced, earnest, and



honest man, was the best thing in the world for this purpose. 



So was adopted the plan of beginning most courses with



an extended course of lectures upon human physiology, in



which to real practice in investigation by the class is added



the hearing of a first-rate lecturer.







As regards the course in literature, I determined that



use should be made of this to promote the general culture



of students, as had been done up to that time by very



few of our American universities.  At Yale in my day,



there was never even a single lecture on any subject



in literature, either ancient or modern: everything was



done by means of ``recitations'' from text-books; and



while young men read portions of masterpieces in Greek



and Latin, their attention was hardly ever directed to



these as literature.  As regards the great fields of modern



literature, nothing whatever was done.  In the English



literature and language, every man was left entirely to his



own devices.  One of the first professors I called to Cornell



was Hiram Corson, who took charge of the department



of English literature; and from that day to this he has



been a center from which good culture has radiated among



our students.  Professor H. B. Sprague was also called;



and he also did excellent work, though in a different way. 



I also added non-resident professors.  My original scheme



I still think a good one.  It was to call James Russell Lowell



for early English literature, Bishop Arthur Cleveland



Coxe for the literature of the Elizabethan and Jacobean



periods, Edwin Whipple for the literature of Queen



Anne's time, and George William Curtis for recent and



contemporary literature.  Each of these men was admirable



as a scholar and lecturer in the particular field named;



but the restricted means of the university obliged me to



cut the scheme down, so that it included simply Lowell



for early and Curtis for recent literature.  Other lectures



in connection with the instruction of the resident professors



marked an epoch, and did much to remove anything



like Philistinism from the student body.  Bayard Taylor's



lectures in German literature thus supplemented admirably



the excellent work of the resident professors Hewett



and Horatio White.  To remove still further any danger of



Philistinism, I called an eminent graduate of Harvard,--



Charles Chauncey Shackford,--whose general lectures in



various fields of literature were attractive and useful.  In



all this I was mainly influenced by the desire to prevent



the atmosphere of the university becoming simply and



purely that of a scientific and technical school.  Highly as



I prized the scientific spirit and technical training, I



felt that the frame of mind engendered by them should be



modified by an acquaintance with the best literature as



literature.  There were many evidences that my theory



was correct.  Some of our best students in the technical



departments developed great love for literary studies. 



One of them attracted much attention by the literary



excellence of his writings; and on my speaking to him about



it, and saying that it seemed strange to me that a man



devoted to engineering should show such a taste for



literature, he said that there was no greater delight to him



than passing from one of the studies to the other--that



each was a recreation after the other.







The effort to promote that element in the general culture



of the student body which comes from literature, ancient



and modern, gained especial strength from a source



usually unpromising--the mathematical department. 



Two professors highly gifted in this field exercised a wide



and ennobling influence outside it.  First of these was



Evan William Evans, who had been known to me at Yale



as not only one of the best scholars in the class of 1851,



but also one of its two foremost writers.  Later, he



developed a passion for modern literature, and his influence



was strongly felt in behalf of the humanities.  His



successor was James Edward Oliver, a graduate of Harvard,



a genius in his chosen field, but always exercising a large



influence by virtue of his broad, liberal, tolerant views of



life which were promoted by study of the best thoughts of



the best thinkers of all times.







The work of organizing and developing the general



courses was comparatively easy, and the stimulus given at



the outset by the non-resident professors rendered it



all the more so.  But with the technical departments and



special courses there were grave difficulties.  The department



of civil engineering, of course, went easily enough;



there were plenty of precedents for it, and the admirable



professor first elected was, at his death, succeeded by



another who most vigorously and wisely developed it: Estevan



Fuertes, drawn from the most attractive surroundings



in the island of Porto Rico to the United States by a deep



love of science, and retained here during the rest of his



life by a love, no less sincere, for American liberty--a rare



combination of the virtues and capabilities of the Latin



races with the best results of an American environment.  I



may mention, in passing, that this combination came out



curiously in his views of American citizenship.  He was



wont to marvel at the indifference of the average American



to his privileges and duties, and especially at the lack



of a proper estimate of his function at elections.  I have



heard him say:  ``When I vote, I put on my best clothes



and my top hat, go to the polls, salute the officers, take off



my hat, and cast my ballot.''







It may be worth mentioning here that, at the election of



the first professor in this department, a curious question



arose.  Among the candidates was one from Harvard,



whose testimonials showed him to be an admirable



acquisition; and among these testimonials was one from an



eminent bishop, who spoke in high terms of the scientific



qualifications of the candidate, but added that he felt it



his duty to warn me that the young man was a Unitarian. 



At this I wrote the bishop, thanking him, and saying that



the only question with me was as to the moral and intellectual



qualifications of the candidate; and that if these



were superior to those of other candidates, I would nominate 



him to the trustees even if he were a Buddhist.  The



good bishop at first took some offense at this; and, in one



of the communications which ensued, expressed doubts



whether laymen had any right to teach at all, since the



command to teach was given to the apostles and their



successors, and seemed therefore confined to those who had



received holy orders; but he became most friendly later,



and I look back to my meetings with him afterward as



among the delightful episodes of my life.







The technical department which caused me the most



anxiety was that of agriculture.  It had been given the



most prominent place in the Congressional act of 1862,



and in our charter from the State in 1865.  But how



should agriculture be taught; what proportion should we



observe between theory and practice; and what should the



practice be?  These questions elicited all sorts of answers. 



Some eminent agriculturists insisted that the farm should



be conducted purely as a business operation; others that



it should be a ``model farm''--regardless of balance



sheets; others still that it should be wholly experimental. 



Our decision was to combine what was best in all these



views; and several men attempted this as resident professors,



but with small success.  One day, after a series of



such failures, when we were almost desperate, there



appeared a candidate from an agricultural college in Ireland. 



He bore a letter from an eminent clergyman in New York,



was of pleasing appearance and manners, gave glowing



accounts of the courses he had followed, expatiated on the



means by which farming had been carried to a high point



in Scotland, and ventured suggestions as to what might



be done in America.  I had many misgivings.  His



experience was very remote from ours, and he seemed to



me altogether too elegant for the work in hand; but Mr.



Cornell had visited English farms, was greatly impressed



by their excellence, and urged a trial of the new-comer. 



He was duly called; and, that he might begin his courses



of instruction, an order was given for a considerable



collection of English agricultural implements and for the



erection of new farm-buildings after English patterns,



Mr. Cornell generously advancing the required money.







All this took time--much time.  At first great things



were expected by the farmers of the State, but gradually



their confidence waned.  As they saw the new professor



walking over the farm in a dilettantish way, superintending



operations with gloved hands, and never touching



any implement, doubts arose which soon ripened into



skepticism.  Typical were the utterances of our farm



manager.  He was a plain, practical farmer, who had taken the



first prize of the State Agricultural Society for the



excellence of his own farm; and, though he at first indulged



in high hopes regarding the new professor, he soon had



misgivings, and felt it his duty to warn me.  He said: 



``Yew kin depend on 't, he ain't a-goin' to do nothin'; he



don't know nothin' about corn, and he don't want to



know nothin' about corn; AND HE DON'T BELIEVE IN PUNKINS! 



Depend on 't, as soon as his new barn is finished



and all his new British tackle is brought together, he'll



quit the job.''  I reasoned that, to a farmer brought up



among the glorious fields of Indian corn in western New



York, and accustomed to rejoice in the sight of golden



pumpkins, diffusion of other cultures must seem like treason;



but, alas! he was right.  As soon as the new buildings



and arrangements were ready for our trial of British



scientific agriculture, the young foreign professor notified



me that he had accepted the headship of an agricultural



college in Canada.  Still, he met with no greater success



there than with us; nor was his reputation increased when,



after the foul attacks made upon Mr. Cornell in the



legislature, he volunteered to come to the investigation and



testify that Mr. Cornell was ``not a practical man.''  In



this the career of the young agriculturist culminated. 



Having lost his professorship in Canada, he undertook



the management of a grocery in the oil-regions of western



Pennsylvania; and scientific British agriculture still



awaits among us a special representative.  Happily, since



that day, men trained practically in the agriculture of the



United States have studied the best British methods, and



brought us much that has been of real use.







Fortunately I had found three men who enabled us to



tide our agricultural department over those dark days, in



which we seemed to be playing ``Hamlet'' with Hamlet



left out.  The first of these was the Hon. John Stanton



Gould, whom I called as a lecturer upon agriculture.  He



had been president of the State Agricultural Society, and



was eminent, not only for his knowledge of his subject,



but for his power of making it interesting.  Men came



away from Mr. Gould's lectures filled with intense desire



to get hold of a spade or hoe and to begin turning the soil.







So, also, the steady work of Professor George C. Caldwell,



whom I had called from the State College of Pennsylvania



to take charge of the department of agricultural



chemistry, won the respect of all leaders in agriculture



throughout the State, and, indeed, throughout the country. 



And with especial gratitude should be named Dr.



James Law of the British Royal Veterinary College, whom



I had found in London, and called to our veterinary



professorship.  Never was there a more happy selection. 



From that day to this, thirty-six years, he has been a



tower of strength to the university, and has rendered



incalculable services to the State and Nation.  His quiet,



thorough work impressed every one most favorably.  The



rudest of the surrounding farmers learned more and more



to regard him with respect and admiration, and the State



has recently recognized his services by establishing in



connection with the university a State veterinary college



under his control.







The work of these three men saved us.  Apart from it,



the agricultural department long remained a sort of slough



of despond; but at last a brighter day dawned.  From the



far-off State Agricultural College of Iowa came tidings



of a professor--Mr. J. I. P. Roberts--who united the practical



and theoretical qualities desired.  I secured him, and



thenceforward there was no more difficulty.  For more



than twenty years, as professor and lecturer, he has



largely aided in developing agriculture throughout the



State and country; and when others were added to



him, like Comstock and Bailey, the success of the



department became even more brilliant.  Still, its old



reputation lasted for a time, even after a better era had



been fully ushered in.  About a year after the tide had



thus turned a meeting of the State ``Grange'' was held



at the neighboring city of Elmira; and the leading speakers



made the university and its agricultural college an



object of scoffing which culminated in a resolution



denouncing both, and urging the legislature to revoke our



charter.  At this a bright young graduate of Cornell, an



instructor in the agricultural department, who happened



to be present, stood up manfully, put a few pertinent



questions, found that none of the declaimers had visited the



university, declared that they were false to their duty in



not doing so, protested against their condemning the



institution unheard and unseen, and then and there invited



them all to visit the institution and its agricultural



department without delay.  Next day this whole body of farmers,



with their wives, sons, and daughters, were upon us. 



Everything was shown them.  Knowing next to nothing



about modern appliances for instruction in science and



they were amazed at all they saw; the libraries,



the laboratories, and, above all, the natural-science



collections and models greatly impressed them.  They were taken



everywhere, and shown not only our successes but our



failures; nothing was concealed from them, and, as a result,



though they ``came to scoff,'' they ``remained to



pray.''  They called a new session of their body, pledged



to us their support, and passed resolutions commending



our work and condemning the State legislature for not



doing more in our behalf.  That was the turning-point for



the agricultural department; and from that day to this



the legislature has dealt generously with us, and the



influence of the department for good throughout the State



has been more and more widely acknowledged.







Of the two technical departments referred to in the origi-



nal act of Congress, the second--specified under the vague



name of ``Mechanic Arts''--went better, though there was



at first much groping to find just what ought to be done. 



First of all, there was a danger which demanded delicate



handling.  This danger lay in Mr. Cornell's wish to establish,



in vital connection with the university, great factories



for the production of articles for sale, especially chairs



and shoes, thus giving large bodies of students opportunities



for self-support.  In discussing this matter with him,



I pointed to the fact that, in becoming a manufacturing



corporation we were making a business venture never



contemplated by our charter; that it was exceedingly doubtful



whether such a corporation could be combined with an



educational institution without ruining both; that the men



best fitted to manage a great factory were hardly likely



to be the best managers of a great institution of learning;



that under our charter we had duties, not merely to those



who wished to support themselves by labor, but to others;



and I finally pointed out to him many reasons for holding



that such a scheme contravened the act of Congress and



the legislation of the State.  I insisted that the object of



our charters from the State and Nation was not to enable



a great number of young men to secure an elementary



education while making shoes and chairs; that for these



the public schools were provided; that our main purpose



must be to send out into all parts of the State and Nation



thoroughly trained graduates, who should develop and



improve the main industries of the country, and, by their



knowledge and example, train up skilful artisans of



various sorts and in every locality.  Mr. Cornell's conduct



in this matter was admirable.  Tenacious as he



usually was when his opinion was formed, and much as it



must have cost him to give up what had become a darling



project, he yielded to this view.







New questions now opened as to this ``Department of



Mechanic Arts.''  It was clear to me, from what I had



seen abroad, that not all the models I had sent from



Europe would be sufficient to give the practical character



which such a department needed; that its graduates must



have a direct, practical acquaintance with the construction



and use of machinery before they could become leaders in



great mechanical enterprises; that they must be made, not



only mathematicians and draftsmen, but skilled workmen,



practically trained in the best methods and processes. 



A very shrewd artisan said to me:  ``When a young



mechanical engineer comes among us fresh from college, only



able to make figures and pictures, we rarely have much



respect for him: the trouble with the great majority



of those who come from technical institutions is that



they don't know as much about practical methods and



processes as we know.''







I felt that there was truth in this, but, as things were,



hardly dared tell this to the trustees.  It would have scared



them, for it seemed to open the door to great expenditures



demanded by a mere theory; but I laid my views before



Mr. Cornell, and he agreed with me so far as to send to



us from his agricultural works at Albany sundry large



pieces of old machinery, which he thought might be



rebuilt for our purposes.  But this turned out to be hardly



practicable.  I dared not, at that stage of the proceedings,



bring into the board of trustees a proposal to buy machinery



and establish a machine-shop; the whole would have a



chimerical look, and was sure to repel them.  Therefore it



was that, at my own expense, I bought a power-lathe and



other pieces of machinery; and, through the active efforts



of Professor John L. Morris, my steadfast supporter in



the whole matter, these were set up in our temporary



wooden laboratory.  A few students began using them, and



to good purpose.  Mr. Cornell was greatly pleased.  Other



trustees of a practical turn visited the place, and the result



was that opinion in the governing board soon favored a



large practical equipment for the department.







On this I prepared a report, taking up the whole subject



with great care, and brought it before them, my main



suggestion being that a practical beginning of the department



should be made by the erection and equipment of a



small building on the north side of the university grounds,



near our main water-power.  Then came a piece of great



good fortune.  Among the charter trustees of the university



was Mr. Cornell's old friend and associate in telegraphic



enterprise, Hiram Sibley of Rochester; and at the



close of the meeting Mr. Sibley asked me if I could give



him a little time on the university grounds after the



adjournment of the meeting.  I, of course, assented; and



next morning, on our visiting the grounds together, he



asked me to point out the spot where the proposed college



of mechanic arts might best be placed.  On my doing so, he



looked over the ground carefully, and then said that he



would himself erect and equip the building.  So began



Sibley College, which is to-day, probably, all things



considered, the most successful department of this kind in



our own country, and perhaps in any country.  In the



hands, first of Professors Morris and Sweet, and later



under the direction of Dr. Thurston, it has become of



the greatest value to every part of the United States, and



indeed to other parts of the American continent.







At the outset a question arose, seemingly trivial, but



really serious.  Mr. Sibley had gone far beyond his original



proposals; and when the lecture-rooms, drafting-



rooms, modeling-rooms, foundries, shops for ironwork,



woodwork, and the like, had been finished, the question



came up:  Shall our aim be to produce things having a



pecuniary value, or shall we produce simply samples of



the most highly finished workmanship, having, generally,



no value?  Fortunately, Professors Morris and Sweet were



able to combine both these purposes, and to employ a



considerable number of students in the very best of work



which had a market value.  The whole thing was thereby



made a success, but it waited long for recognition.  A



result followed not unlike some which have occurred in



other fields in our country.  At the Centennial Exhibition



of 1876, an exhibit was made of the work done by students



in Sibley College, including a steam-engine, power-lathes,



face-plates, and various tools of precision, admirably fin-



ished, each a model in its kind.  But while many mechanics



praised them, they attracted no special attention from



New England authorities.  On the other hand, an exhibit



of samples of work from the School of Technology of



Moscow, which had no merchantable value,--many of the



pieces being of antiquated pattern, but of exquisite finish



and showily arranged,--aroused great admiration among



sundry New England theorists; even the head of the



Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in enthusiastic



magazine articles, called the attention of the whole country to



them, and urged the necessity of establishing machine-



shops in connection with schools of science.  The fact that



this had already been done, and better done, at Cornell,



was loftily ignored.  Western New York seemed a Nazareth



out of which no good could come.  That same straining



of the mind's eye toward the East, that same tendency



to provincialism which had so often afflicted Massachusetts,



evidently prevented her wise men in technology



from recognizing any new departure west of them.







At a later period I had occasion to make a final



comment on all this.  Both as commissioner at the Paris



Exhibition and as minister to Russia, I came to know



intimately Wischniegradsky, who had been the head of the



Moscow School of Technology and afterward Russian



minister of finance.  He spoke to me in the highest terms



of what original American methods had done for railways;



and the climax was reached when the Moscow



methods, so highly praised by Boston critics, proved to be



utterly inadequate in training mechanical engineers to



furnish the machinery needed in Russia, and men from



the American schools, trained in the methods of Cornell,



sent over locomotives and machinery of all sorts for the



new Trans-Siberian Railway, of which the eastern terminus



was that very city of Moscow which enjoyed the



privileges so lauded and magnified by the Boston critics! 



Time has reversed their judgment: the combination of the



two systems, so ably and patiently developed by Director



Thurston, is the one which has happily prevailed.







Few days in the history of Cornell University have



been so fraught with good as that on which Thurston



accepted my call to the headship of Sibley College.  At the



very outset he gained the confidence and gratitude of trustees,



professors, students, and, indeed, of his profession



throughout the country, by his amazing success as



professor, as author, and as organizer and administrator



of that department, which he made not only one of the



largest, but one of the best of its kind in the world.  The



rapidity and wisdom of his decisions, the extent and excellence



of his work, his skill in attracting the best men, his



ability in quieting rivalries and--animosities, and the kindly



firmness of his whole policy were a source of wonder to all



who knew him.  And, at his lamented death in 1903, it was



found that he had rendered another service of a sort which



such strong men as he are often incapable of rendering--



he had trained a body of assistants and students worthy



to take up his work.







Another department which I had long wished to see



established in our country now began to take shape. 



From my boyhood I had a love for architecture.  In my



young manhood this had been developed by readings in



Ruskin, and later by architectural excursions in Europe;



and the time had now arrived when it seemed possible



to do something for it.  I had collected what, at that



period, was certainly one of the largest, if not the largest,



of the architectural libraries in the United States, besides



several thousand large architectural photographs, drawings,



casts, models, and other material from every country



in Europe.  This had been, in fact, my pet extravagance;



and a propitious time seeming now to arrive, I proposed



to the trustees that if they would establish a department



of architecture and call a professor to it, I would transfer



to it my special library and collections.  This offer was



accepted; and thus was founded this additional department,



which began its good career under Professor Charles



Babcock, who, at this present writing, is enjoying, as



professor emeritus, the respect and gratitude of a long



series of classes which have profited by his teachings, and



the cordial companionship of his colleagues, who rejoice



to profit by his humorous, but none the less profound,



observations upon problems arising in the university and in



the world in general.







As regards this illustrative material, I recall one



curious experience.  While on one of my architectural



excursions through the great towns of eastern France, I



arrived at Troyes.  On visiting the government agent for



photographing public monuments, I noticed in his rooms



some admirably executed pieces of stone carving,--capitals,



corbels, and the like,--and on my asking him whence



these came, he told me that they had been recently taken



out of the cathedral by the architect who was ``restoring''



it.  After my purchases were made, he went with me to



this great edifice, one of the finest in Europe; and there



I found that, on each side of the high altar, the architect



had taken out several brackets, or corbels, of the best



mediaeval work, and substituted new ones designed by



himself.  One of these corbels thus taken out the government



photographer had in his possession.  It was very striking,



representing the grotesque face of a monk in the midst of



a mass of foliage supporting the base of a statue, all being



carved with great spirit.  Apart from its architectural



value, it had a historical interest, since it must have



witnessed the famous betrothal of the son and daughter of



the English and French kings mentioned in Shakspere,



to say nothing of many other mediaeval pageants.







On my making known to the photographer the fact that



I was engaged in founding a school of architecture in the



United States, and was especially anxious to secure a good



specimen of French work, he sold me this example, which



is now in the museum of the Architectural Department at



Cornell.  I allude to this, in passing, as showing what



monstrous iniquities (and I could name many others) are



committed in the great mediaeval buildings of Europe



under pretense of ``restoration.''















CHAPTER XXII







FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF UNIVERSITY COURSES--1870-1872







In close connection with the technical departments were



various laboratories.  For these, place was at first



made here and there in cellars and sheds; but at last we



were able to erect for them buildings large and complete,



and to the opening of the first of these came Mr. Cleveland,



then Governor of New York, and later President of



the United States.  Having laid the corner-stone of the



Memorial Chapel and made an excellent speech, which



encouraged us all, he accompanied me to the new building



devoted to chemistry and physics, which was then opened



for the first time.  On entering it, he expressed his surprise



at its equipment, and showed that he had seen nothing



of the kind before.  I learned afterward that he had



received a thorough preparation in classics and mathematics



for college, but that, on account of the insufficient means



of his father, he was obliged to give up his university



course; and it was evident, from his utterances at this



time, as well as when visiting other colleges and universities,



that he lamented this.







Out of this laboratory thus opened was developed,



later, a new technical department.  Among my happiest



hours were those spent in visiting the various buildings,



collections, and lecture-rooms, after my morning's work,



to see how all were going on; and, during various visits



to the new laboratory I noticed that the majority of the



students were, in one way or another, giving attention to



matters connected with electricity.  There had already



been built in the machine-shops, under the direction of



Professor Anthony, a dynamo which was used in lighting



our grounds, this being one of the first examples



of electric lighting in the United States; and on one



of my visits I said to him, ``It looks much as if, with



the rapid extension throughout the country of the telegraph,



telephone, electric lighting, and electric railways,



we shall be called on, before long, to train men for



a new profession in connection with them.''  As he



assented to this, I asked him to sketch out a plan for



a ``Department of Electrical Engineering,'' and in due



time he appeared with it before the executive committee



of the trustees.  But it met much opposition from one of



our oldest members, who was constitutionally averse to



what he thought new-fangled education, partly from



conservatism, partly from considerations of expense; and this



opposition was so threatening that, in order to save the



proposed department, I was obliged to pledge myself to



become responsible for any extra expense caused by it



during the first year.  Upon this pledge it was established. 



Thus was created, as I believe, the first department of



electrical engineering ever known in the United States,



and, so far as I can learn, the first ever known in any



country.







But while we thus strove to be loyal to those parts of



our charter which established technical instruction, there



were other parts in which I personally felt even a deeper



interest.  In my political reminiscences I have acknowledged



the want of preparation in regard to practical



matters of public concern which had hampered me as a



member of the State Senate.  Having revolved this subject



in my mind for a considerable time, I made, while



commissioner to the Paris Exposition of 1878, a careful



examination of the courses of study in political and



economic science established in European universities, and



on my return devoted to this subject my official report. 



Like such reports generally, it was delayed a long time



in the Government Printing-office, was then damned with



faint praise, and nothing more came of it until the following



year, when, being called to deliver the annual address



at the Johns Hopkins University, I wrought its main



points into a plea for education in relation to politics. 



This was widely circulated with some effect, and I now



brought a modest proposal in the premises before our



trustees.  Its main feature was that Mr. Frank B. Sanborn,



a graduate of Harvard, Secretary of the Board of



Charities of the State of Massachusetts and of the Social



Science Association of the United States, should be called



to give a course of practical lectures before the senior



class during at least one term,--his subjects to be such as



pauperism, crime (incipient and chronic), inebriety, lunacy,



and the best dealing of modern states with these;



also that his instructions should be given, not only by



lectures, but by actual visits with his classes to the great



charitable and penal institutions of the State, of which



there were many within easy distance of the university. 



For several years, and until the department took a different



form, this plan was carried out with excellent results. 



Professor Sanborn and his students, beginning with the



county almshouse and jail, visited the reformatories, the



prisons, the penitentiaries, and the asylums of various sorts



in the State; made careful examinations of them; drew up



reports upon them, these reports forming the subject of



discussions in which professor and students took earnest



part; and a number of young men who have since taken



influential places in the State legislature were thus



instructed as to the best actual and possible dealings with all



these subjects.  I still think that more should be done in



all our universities to train men by this method for the



public service in this most important and interesting field,



and also in matters pertaining generally to State, county,



and city administration.







Closely connected with this instruction was that in



political economy and history.  As to the first of these, I



had, some years before, seen reason to believe that my



strong, and perhaps bigoted free-trade ideas were at least



not so universal in their application as I had supposed. 



Down to the time of our Civil War I had been very intolerant



on this subject, practically holding a protectionist



to be either a Pharisee or an idiot.  I had convinced



myself not only that the principles of free trade are



axiomatic, but that they afford the only means of binding



nations together in permanent peace; that Great Britain



was our best friend; that, in desiring us to adopt her own



system, she was moved by broad, philosophic, and



philanthropic considerations.  But as the war drew on and I



saw the haughtiness and selfishness toward us shown by



her ruling classes, there came in my mind a revulsion



which led me to examine more closely the foundations



of my economical belief.  I began to attribute more



importance to John Stuart Mill's famous ``exception,''



to the effect that the building up of certain industries



may be necessary to the very existence of a nation, and



that perhaps the best way of building them up is to



adopt an adequate system of protective duties.  Down



to this time I had been a disciple of Adam Smith and



Bastiat; but now appeared the published lectures of



Roscher of Leipsic, upon what he called ``The Historical



System'' of political economy.  Its fundamental idea was



that political economy is indeed a science, to be wrought



out by scientific methods; but that the question how far



its conclusions are adapted to the circumstances of any



nation at any time is for statesmen to determine.  This



impressed me much.  Moreover, I was forced to acknowledge



that the Morrill protective tariff, adopted at the



Civil War period, was a necessity for revenue; so that



my old theory of a tariff for revenue easily developed



into a belief in a tariff for revenue with incidental



protection.  This idea has been developed in my mind as time



has gone on, until at present I am a believer in protection



as the only road to ultimate free trade.  My process of



reasoning on the subject I have given in another chapter.







At the opening of the university there was but little



instruction in political economy, that little being mainly



given by our professor of moral philosophy, Dr. Wilson,



a man broad in his views and strong in reasoning power,



who had been greatly impressed by the ideas of Friedrich



List, the German protectionist.  But lectures were also



given by free-traders, and I adopted the plan of having



both sides as well represented as possible.  This was, at



first, complained of; sundry good people said it was like



calling a professor of atheism into a theological seminary;



but my answer was that our university was not, like a



theological seminary, established to arrive at certain



conclusions fixed beforehand, or to propagate an established



creed; that, political economy not being an exact science,



our best course was to call eminent lecturers to present



both sides of the main questions in dispute.  The result was



good.  It stimulated much thought, and doubtless did



something to promote that charity to opposing economical



opinions which in my own case had been, through my



early manhood, so conspicuously lacking.







The second of these departments--history--was the



one for which I cared most.  I believed then, and later



experience has strengthened my conviction, that the best



of all methods in presenting every subject bearing on



political and social life is the historical.  My own studies



had been mainly in this field, and I did what I could



to establish historical courses in the university.  The



lectures which I had given at the University of Michigan



were now developed more fully and again presented; but



to these I constantly added new lectures and, indeed, new



courses, though at a great disadvantage, since my administrative



duties stood constantly in the way of my professorial



work.  At the same time I went on collecting my



historical library until it became, in its way, probably the



largest and most complete of its kind in the possession of



any individual in the United States.  Gradually strong



men were drawn into the department, and finally there



came one on whom I could lay a large portion of the work.







The story is somewhat curious.  During the year 1877-



1878, in Germany and France, I had prepared a short



course of lectures upon the historical development of criminal



law; and while giving it to my senior class after my



return, I noticed a student, two or three years below the



average age of the class, carefully taking notes and



apparently much interested.  One day, going toward my



house after the lecture, I found him going in the same



direction, and, beginning conversation with him, learned



that he was a member of the sophomore class; that he had



corresponded with me, two or three years before, as to the



best means of working his way through the university;



had followed out a suggestion of mine, then made, in that



he had learned the printer's trade; had supported himself



through the preparatory school by means of it, and was



then carrying himself through college by setting type for



the university press.  Making inquiries of professors and



students, I found that the young man, both at school and



at the university, was, as a rule, at the head of every class



he had entered; and therefore it was that, when the



examination papers came in at the close of the term, I



first took up his papers to see how he had stood the test. 



They proved to be masterly.  There were excellent scholars



in the senior class, but not one had done so well as this



young sophomore; in fact, I doubt whether I could have



passed a better examination on my own lectures.  There



was in his answers a combination of accuracy with breadth



which surprised me.  Up to that time, passing judgment



on the examination papers had been one of the most



tedious of my burdens; for it involved wading through



several hundred pages of crabbed manuscript, every term,



and weighing carefully the statements therein embodied. 



A sudden light now flashed upon me.  I sent for the young



sophomore, cautioned him to secrecy, and then and there



made him my examiner in history.  He, a member of the



sophomore class, took the papers of the seniors and resident



graduates, and passed upon them carefully and admirably--



better than I should have ever had the time and



patience to do.  Of course this was kept entirely secret;



for had the seniors known that I had intrusted their papers



to the tender mercies of a sophomore, they would probably



have mobbed me.  This mode of examination continued



until the young man's graduation, when he was



openly appointed examiner in history, afterward



becoming instructor in history, then assistant professor;



and, finally, another university having called him to a



full professorship, he was appointed full professor of



history at Cornell, and has greatly distinguished himself



both by his ability in research and his power in teaching. 



To him have been added others as professors, assistant



professors, and instructors, so that the department is now



on an excellent footing.  In one respect its development has



been unexpectedly satisfactory.  At the opening of the



university one of my strongest hopes had been to establish a



professorship of American history.  It seemed to me monstrous



that there was not, in any American university, a



course of lectures on the history of the United States; and



that an American student, in order to secure such



instruction in the history of his own country, must go to



the lectures of Laboulaye at the Coll<e!>ge de France.  Thither



I had gone some years before, and had been greatly



impressed by Laboulaye's admirable presentation of his



subject, and awakened to the fact that American history



is not only more instructive, but more interesting, than



I had ever supposed it.  My first venture was to call



Professor George W. Greene of Brown University for a



course of lectures on the history of our Revolutionary



period, and Professor Dwight of Columbia College for



a course upon the constitutional history of the United



States.  But finally my hope was more fully realized:  I



was enabled to call as resident professor my old friend



Moses Coit Tyler, whose book on the ``History of American



Literature'' is a classic, and who, in his new field,



exerted a powerful influence for good upon several



generations of students.  More than once since, as I have



heard him, it has been borne in upon me that I was born



too soon.  Remembering the utter want of any such



instruction in my own college days, I have especially envied



those who have had the good fortune to be conducted by



him, and men like him, through the history of our own



country.[6]











[6] To my great sorrow, he died in 1900.--A. D. W.











In some of these departments to which I have referred



there were occasionally difficulties requiring much tact



in handling.  During my professorial days at the University



of Michigan I once heard an eminent divine deliver



an admirable address on what he called ``The Oscillatory



Law of Human Progress''--that is, upon the tendency



of human society, when reacting from one evil, to swing



to another almost as serious in the opposite direction.  In



swinging away from the old cast-iron course of instruction,



and from the text-book recitation of the mere dry



bones of literature, there may be seen at this hour some



tendency to excessive reaction.  When I note in sundry



university registers courses of instruction offered in some



of the most evanescent and worthless developments of



contemporary literature,--some of them, indeed, worse



than worthless,--I think of a remark made to me by a



college friend of mine who will be remembered by the



Yale men of the fifties for his keen and pithy judgments



of men and things.  Being one day in New Haven looking



for assistant professors and instructors, I met him; and,



on my answering his question as to what had brought me,



he said, ``If at any time you want a professor of HORSE



SENSE, call ME.''  I have often thought of this proposal



since, and have at times regretted that some of our institutions



of learning had not availed themselves of his services. 



The fact is that, under the new system, ``horse sense'' is



especially called for to prevent a too extreme reaction from



the evils which afflicted university instruction during my



student days.







While it rejoices my heart to see the splendid courses



in modern literature now offered at our larger universities,



some of them arouse misgivings.  Reflecting upon



the shortness of human life and the vast mass of really



GREAT literature, I see with regret courses offered dealing



with the bubbles floating on the surface of sundry literatures--



bubbles soon to break, some of them with ill odor.







I would as soon think of endowing restaurants to enable



young men to appreciate caviar, or old Gorgonzola, or



game of a peculiarly ``high'' character, as of establishing



courses dealing with Villon, Baudelaire, Swinburne, and



the like; and when I hear of second-rate critics summoned



across the ocean to present to universities which



have heard Emerson, Longfellow, Henry Reed, Lowell,



Whipple, and Curtis the coagulated nastiness of Verlaine,



Mallarm<e'>, and their compeers, I expect next to



hear of courses introducing young men to the beauties of



absinthe, Turkish cigarettes, and stimulants unspeakable. 



Doubtless these things are all due to the ``oscillatory



law of human progress,'' which professors of ``horse



sense'' like my friend Joe Sheldon will gradually do



away with.







As time went on, buildings of various sorts rose around



the university grounds, and, almost without exception, as



gifts from men attracted by the plan of the institution.  At



the annual commencement in 1869 was laid the cornerstone



of an edifice devoted especially to lecture-rooms and



museums of natural science.  It was a noble gift by Mr.



John McGraw; and amid the cares and discouragements



of that period it gave us new heart, and strengthened



the institution especially on the scientific side.  In order



to do honor to this occasion, it was decided to invite leading



men from all parts of the State, and, above all, to



request the governor, Mr. Fenton, to lay the corner-stone. 



But it was soon evident that his excellency's old fear of



offending the sectarian schools still controlled him.  He



made excuse, and we then called on the Freemasons to



take charge of the ceremony.  They came in full



regalia, bringing their own orators; and, on the appointed



day, a great body of spectators was grouped about



the foundations of the new building on the beautiful



knoll in front of the upper quadrangle.  It was an ideal



afternoon in June, and the panorama before and around



us was superb.  Immediately below us, in front, lay the



beautiful valley in which nestles the little city of Ithaca;



beyond, on the left, was the vast amphitheater, nearly



surrounded by hills and distant mountains; and on the



right, Cayuga Lake, stretching northward for forty miles. 



Few points in our country afford a nobler view of lake,



mountain, hill, and valley.  The speakers naturally



expatiated in all the moods and tenses on the munificence



of Mr. Cornell and Mr. McGraw; and when all was ended



the great new bell, which had just been added to the



university chime in the name of one most dear to me,--the



largest bell then swinging in western New York, inscribed



with the verse written for it by Lowell,--boomed grandly



forth.  As we came away I walked with Goldwin Smith,



and noticed that he was convulsed with suppressed laughter. 



On my asking him the cause, he answered:  ``There



is nothing more to be said; no one need ever praise the



work of Mr. Cornell again.''  On my asking the professor



what he meant, he asked me if I had not heard the last



speech.  I answered in the negative--that my mind was



occupied with other things.  He then quoted it substantially



as follows:  ``Fellow-citizens, when Mr. Cornell



found himself rich beyond the dreams of avarice, did he



give himself up to a life of inglorious ease?  No, fellow-



citizens; he founded the beautiful public library in



yonder valley.  But did he then retire to a life of luxury? 



No, fellow-citizens; he came up to this height (and



here came a great wave of the hand over the vast



amphitheater below and around us) and he established this



UNIVERSE!''







In reference to this occasion I may put on record



Lowell's quatrain above referred to, which is cast upon the



great clock-bell of the university.  It runs as follows:







   I call as fly the irrevocable hours



   Futile as air, or strong as fate to make



   Your lives of sand or granite.  Awful powers,



   Even as men choose, they either give or take.











There was also cast upon it the following, from the



Psalter version of Psalm xcii:











To tell of thy loving-kindness early in the morning: and of thy



truth in the night season.











While various departments were thus developed, there



was going on a steady evolution in the general conception



of the university.  In the Congressional act of 1862 was a



vague provision for military instruction in the institutions



which might be created under it.  The cause of this was



evident.  The bill was passed during one of the most critical



periods in the history of the Civil War, and in my



inaugural address I had alluded to this as most honorable



to Senator Morrill and to the Congress which had adopted



his proposals.  It was at perhaps the darkest moment in



the history of the United States that this provision was



made, in this Morrill Act, for a great system of classical,



scientific, and technical instruction in every State and



Territory of the Union; and I compared this enactment, at



so trying a period, to the conduct of the Romans in buying



and selling the lands on which the Carthaginians were



encamped after their victory at Cannae.  The provision



for military instruction had been inserted in this act of



1862 because Senator Morrill and others saw clearly the



advantage which had accrued to the States then in rebellion



from their military schools; but the act had left



military instruction optional with the institutions securing



the national endowment, and, so far as I could learn, none



of those already created had taken the clause very



seriously.  I proposed that we should accept it fully and



fairly, not according to the letter of the act, but to the



spirit of those who had passed it; indeed, that we should



go further than any other institution had dreamed of



going, so that every undergraduate not excused on the



ground of conscientious scruples, or for some other



adequate cause, should be required to take a thorough



course of military drill; and to this end I supported a plan,



which was afterward carried out by law, that officers from



the United States army should be detailed by the Secretary



of War to each of the principal institutions as military



professors.  My reasons for this were based on my



recollections of what took place at the University of Michigan



during the Civil War.  I had then seen large numbers of



my best students go forth insufficiently trained, and in



some cases led to destruction by incompetent officers.  At



a later period, I had heard the West Point officer whom I



had secured from Detroit to train those Michigan students



express his wonder at the rapidity with which they learned



what was necessary to make them soldiers and even officers. 



Being young men of disciplined minds, they learned



the drill far more quickly and intelligently than the



average recruits could do.  There was still another reason for



taking the military clause in the Morrill Act seriously. 



I felt then, and feel now, that our Republic is not to



escape serious internal troubles; that in these her reliance



must be largely upon her citizen soldiery; that it will be a



source of calamity, possibly of catastrophe, if the power



of the sword in civil commotions shall fall into the hands



of ignorant and brutal leaders, while the educated men of



the country, not being versed in military matters, shall



slink away from the scene of duty, cower in corners, and



leave the conduct of military affairs to men intellectually



and morally their inferiors.  These views I embodied in



a report to the trustees; and the result was the formation



of a university battalion, which has been one of the best



things at Cornell.  A series of well-qualified officers, sent



by the War Department, have developed the system admirably. 



Its good results to the university have been acknowledged



by all who have watched its progress.  Farmers'



boys,--slouchy, careless, not accustomed to obey any word



of command; city boys, sometimes pampered, often wayward,



have thus been in a short time transformed: they



stand erect; they look the world squarely in the face; the



intensity of their American individualism is happily



modified; they can take the word of command and they can



give it.  I doubt whether any feature of instruction at



Cornell University has produced more excellent results



upon CHARACTER than the training thus given.  And this is



not all.  The effect on the State has been valuable.  It has



already been felt in the organization and maintenance of



the State militia; and during the war with Spain,



Cornellians, trained in the university battalion, rendered



noble service.







Among the matters which our board of trustees and



faculty had to decide upon at an early day was the



conferring of degrees.  It had become, and indeed has



remained in many of our colleges down to the present



day, an abuse, and a comical abuse.  Almost more than



any other thing, it tends to lower respect for many American



colleges and universities among thinking men.  The



older and stronger universities are free from it; but many



of the newer ones, especially various little sectarian



colleges, some of them calling themselves ``universities,''



have abused and are abusing beyond measure their privilege



of conferring degrees.  Every one knows individuals



in the community whose degrees, so far from adorning



them, really render them ridiculous; and every one knows



colleges and ``universities'' made ridiculous by the



conferring of such pretended honors.







At the outset I proposed to our trustees that Cornell



University should confer no honorary degrees of any



sort, and a law was passed to that effect.  This was



observed faithfully during my entire presidency; then the



policy was temporarily changed, and two honorary doctorates



were conferred; but this was immediately followed



by a renewal of the old law, and Cornell has conferred no



honorary degrees since.







But it is a question whether the time has not arrived



for some relaxation of this policy.  The argument I used



in proposing the law that no honorary degree should be



conferred was that we had not yet built up an institution



whose degrees could be justly considered as of any value. 



That argument is no longer valid, and possibly some departure



from it would now be wise.  Still, the policy of



conferring no honorary degrees is infinitely better than



the policy of lavishing them.







As to regular and ordinary degrees, I had, in my plan



of organization, recommended that there should be but one



degree for all courses, whether in arts, science, or



literature.  I argued that, as all our courses required an equal



amount of intellectual exertion, one simple degree should



be granted alike to all who had passed the required



examination at the close of their chosen course.  This view



the faculty did not accept.  They adopted the policy



of establishing several degrees: as, for example, for the



course in arts, the degree of A.B.; for the course in science,



the degree of B.S.; for the course in literature, the degree



of B.L.; and so on.  The reason given for this was that



it was important in each case to know what the training



of the individual graduate had been; and that the



true way to obviate invidious distinctions is so to perfect



the newer courses that all the degrees shall finally be



considered as of equal value and honor.  This argument



converted me: it seemed to me just, and my experience



in calling men to professorships led me more and more



to see that I had been wrong and that the faculty was



right; for it was a matter of the greatest importance to



me, in deciding on the qualifications of candidates for



professorships, to know, not only their special fitness, but



what their general education had been.







But, curiously enough, within the last few years the



Cornell faculty, under the lead of its present admirable



president, has reverted to my old argument, accepted it,



and established a single degree for all courses.  I bow



respectfully to their judgment, but my conversion by the



same faculty from my own original ideas was so complete



that I cannot now agree to the wisdom of the change.  It



is a curious case of cross-conversion, I having been and



remaining converted to the ideas of the faculty, and they



having been converted to my original idea.  As to the



whole matter, I have the faith of an optimist that eventu-



ally, with the experience derived from both systems, a



good result will be reached.







Another question which at that time occupied me much



was that of scholarships and fellowships awarded by



competitive examinations versus general gratuitous instruction. 



During the formation of my plans for the university,



a number of excellent men urged upon me that all



our instruction should be thrown open to all mankind free



of charge; that there should be no payment of instruction



fees of any kind; that the policy which prevails in the



public schools of the State should be carried out in the



new institution at the summit of the system.  This demand



was plausible, but the more I thought upon it the more



illogical, fallacious, and injurious it seemed; and, in spite



of some hard knocks in consequence, I have continued to



dissent from it, and feel that events have justified me.







Since this view of mine largely influenced the plan of



the university, this is perhaps as good a place as any to



sketch its development.  In the first place, I soon saw that



the analogy between free education in the public schools



and in the university is delusive, the conditions of the two



being entirely dissimilar.  In a republic like ours primary



education of the voters is a practical necessity.  No republic



of real weight in the world, except Switzerland and



the United States, has proved permanent; and the only



difference between the many republics which have failed



and these two, which, we hope, have succeeded, is that in



the former the great body of the citizens were illiterate,



while in the latter the great body of voters have had some



general education.  Without this education, sufficient for



an understanding of the main questions involved, no real



republic or democracy can endure.  With general primary



education up to a point necessary for the intelligent



exercise of the suffrage, one may have hopes for the continuance



and development of a democratic republic.  On this



account primary education should be made free: it is



part of our political system; it is the essential condition



of its existence.







The purpose of university education is totally different. 



The interest of the Republic is, indeed, that it should



maintain the very highest and best provision for advanced



instruction, general, scientific, and technical; and it is also



in the highest interest of the Republic that its fittest young



men and women should secure such instruction.  No republic,



no nation in fact, possesses any other treasure



comparable to its young citizens of active mind and earnest



purpose.  This is felt at the present time by all the



great nations of the world, and consequently provision



is made in almost all of them for the highest education of



such men and women.  Next to the general primary education



of all voters, the most important duty of our Republic



is to develop the best minds it possesses for the best



service in all its fields of high intellectual activity.  To do



this it must supply the best university education, and



must smooth the way for those to acquire it who are best



fitted for it, no matter how oppressive their poverty.







Now, my first objection to gratuitous university instruction



to all students alike is that it stands in the way of



this most important consummation; that it not only does



not accomplish the end which is desirable, but that it does



accomplish another which is exceedingly undesirable. 



For the real problem to be solved is this:  How shall the



higher education in different fields be brought within



reach of the young men and women best fitted to acquire



it, to profit by it, and to use it to best advantage?  Any



one acquainted with American schools and universities



knows that the vast majority of these young people



best fitted to profit by higher education come from the



families of small means.  What does gratuitous instruction



in the university offer them?  Merely a remission of



instruction fees, which, after all, are but a small part of



the necessary expenses of a university course.  With many



of these young persons--probably with most--a mere



remission of instruction fees is utterly insufficient to enable



them to secure advanced education.  I have alluded to the



case of President Cleveland, who, having been well fitted



for the university, could not enter.  His father being a



country clergyman with a large family and small means,



the future Chief Executive of the United States was obliged



to turn aside to a teacher's place and a clerkship which



afforded him a bare support.  At the Hamilton College



commencement a few years since, Mr. Cleveland, pointing



to one of the professors, was reported as saying in



substance:  ``My old school friend by my side is, of all men,



the one I have most envied: he was able to buy a good



edition of Vergil; I was not.''







It would not have been at all difficult for him to secure



a remission of instruction fees at various American colleges



and universities; but the great difficulty was that he



could not secure the means necessary for his board, for



his clothing, for his traveling expenses, for his books, for



all the other things that go to make up the real cost of life



at a university.  I can think of but one way, and that is,



as a rule, to charge instruction fees upon the great body



of the students, but both to remit instruction fees and to



give scholarships and fellowships to those who, in



competitive examinations and otherwise, show themselves



especially worthy of such privileges.  This is in conformity



to the system of nature; it is the survival of the



fittest.  This was the main reason which led me to insert



in the charter of Cornell University the provision by



which at present six hundred students from the State of



New York are selected by competitive examinations out of



the mass of scholars in the public schools, and to provide



that each of these best scholars shall have free instruction



for four years.







But this was only a part of the system.  From the first



I have urged the fact above mentioned, namely, that while



remission of instruction fees is a step in the right direction,



it is not sufficient; and I have always desired to see



some university recognize the true and sound principle



of free instruction in universities by CONSECRATING ALL



MONEYS RECEIVED FROM INSTRUCTION FEES TO THE CREATION



OF COMPETITIVE SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS, EACH OF WHICH



SHALL AMOUNT TO A SUM SUFFICIENT TO MEET, WITH ECONOMY, THE



LIVING EXPENSES OF A STUDENT.  This plan I was enabled, in



considerable measure, to carry out by establishing the



competitive scholarships in each Assembly district; and



later, as will be seen in another chapter, I was enabled, by



a curious transformation of a calamity into a blessing, to



carry it still further by establishing endowed scholarships



and fellowships.  These latter scholarships, each, as a



general rule, of two hundred and fifty dollars a year, were



awarded to those who passed the best examinations and



maintained the best standing in their classes; while the



fellowships, each of the value of from four to five hundred



dollars a year, were awarded to the seniors of our own or



other universities who had been found most worthy of



them.  In the face of considerable opposition I set this



system in motion at Cornell; and its success leads me to



hope that it will be further developed, not only there, but



elsewhere.  Besides this, I favored arrangements for



remitting instruction fees and giving aid to such students as



really showed promising talent, and who were at the time



needy.  To this end a loan fund was created which has



been carefully managed and has aided many excellent



men through the university courses.[7]  Free instruction,



carried out in accordance with the principle and plan



above sketched, will, I feel sure, prove of great value to



our country.  Its effect is to give to the best and brightest



young men, no matter how poor, just the chance they



need; and not as a matter of charity, but as a matter of



wise policy.  This is a system which I believe would be



fraught with blessings to our country, securing advanced



education to those who can profit by it, and strengthening



their country by means of it.











[7] It has since been greatly increased by the bequest of a



public-spirited New York merchant.











On the other hand, the system of gratuitous remission



of instruction fees to all students alike, whether rich or



poor, I believe to be injurious to the country, for the



following reasons:  First, it generally cripples the insti-



tution which gives it.  Two or three large institutions



which have thought themselves in possession of endowments



sufficient to warrant giving gratuitous instruction



have tried it, but as a rule have not been able to go on



with it, and have at last come to the principle of charging



moderate fees.  Secondly, it simply makes a present of a



small sum to a large number of young men, most of whom



neither need nor appreciate it, and who would be better



for regarding their university instruction as something



worth paying for.







But my main objection to the system of indiscriminate



gratuitous instruction is that it does the country a positive



injury in drawing away from the farms, workshops,



and stores large numbers of young persons who would



better have been allowed to remain there; that it tends to



crowd what have been called ``the learned professions''



with men not really fitted for them; that it draws masses



of men whose good right arms would be of great value in



the rural districts, and makes them parasites in the cities. 



The farmers and the artisans complain of the lack of



young men and women for their work; the professional



men complain that the cities are overstocked with young



men calling themselves lawyers, doctors, engineers, and



the like, but really unworthy to exercise either profession,



who live on the body politic as parasites more or less



hurtful.  This has certainly become an evil in other



countries: every enlightened traveler knows that the ranks of



the anarchists in Russia are swollen by what are called



``fruits secs''--that is, by young men and young women



tempted away from manual labor and avocations for which



they are fit into ``professions'' for which they are unfit. 



The more FIRST-RATE young men and young women our



universities and technical schools educate the better; but the



more young men and women of mediocre minds and weak



purpose whom they push into the ranks of poor lawyers,



poor doctors, poor engineers, and the like, the more injury



they do to the country.







As I now approach the end of life and look back over



the development of Cornell University, this at least seems



to me one piece of good fortune--namely, that I have



aided to establish there the principle of using our means,



so far as possible, not for indiscriminate gratuitous higher



education of men unfit to receive it; not, as President



Jordan has expressed it, in ``trying to put a five-thousand-



dollar education into a fifty-cent boy''; but in establishing



a system which draws out from the community, even from



its poorest and lowliest households, the best, brightest,



strongest young men and women, and develops their best



powers, thus adding to the greatest treasure which their



country can possess.















CHAPTER XXIII







``COEDUCATION'' AND AN UNSECTARIAN PULPIT--1871-1904







Still another new departure was in some respects



bolder than any of those already mentioned.  For



some years before the organization of Cornell, I had



thought much upon the education of women, and had



gradually arrived at the conclusion that they might well be



admitted to some of the universities established for young



men.  Yet, at the same time, Herbert Spencer's argument



as to the importance of avoiding everything like ``mandarinism''



--the attempt to force all educationalinstitutions 



into the same mold--prevented my urging this admission 



of women upon all universities alike.  I recognized obstacles



to it in the older institutions which did not exist in the



newer; but I had come to believe that where no special



difficulties existed, women might well be admitted to



university privileges.  To this view I had been led by my own



observation even in my boyhood.  At Cortland Academy



I had seen young men and women assembled in the classrooms



without difficulty or embarrassment, and at Yale I



had seen that the two or three lecture-rooms which



admitted women were the most orderly and decent of all; but



perhaps the strongest influence in this matter was exercised



upon me by my mother.  She was one of the most conservative



of women, a High-church Episcopalian, and generally



averse to modern reforms; but on my talking over



with her some of my plans for Cornell University, she



said:  ``I am not so sure about your other ideas, but as to



the admission of women you are right.  My main education 



was derived partly from a boarding-school at Pittsfield



considered one of the best in New England, and partly



from Cortland Academy.  In the boarding-school we had



only young women, but in the academy we had both young



men and young women; and I am sure that the results of



the academy were much better than those of the boarding-



school.  The young men and young women learned to respect



each other, not merely for physical, but for intellectual



and moral qualities; so there came a healthful



emulation in study, the men becoming more manly and the



women more womanly; and never, so far as I have heard,



did any of the evil consequences follow which some of



your opponents are prophesying.''







A conference with Dr. Woolworth, a teacher of the very



largest experience, showed me that none of the evil results



which were prophesied had resulted.  He solemnly assured



me that, during his long experiences as principal of two or



three large academies, and, as secretary of the Board of



Regents, in close contact with all the academies and high



schools of the State, he had never known of a serious scandal



arising between students of different sexes.







As I drafted the main features of the university charter



these statements were in my mind, but I knew well that it



would be premature to press the matter at the outset.  It



would certainly have cost us the support of the more



conservative men in the legislature.  All that I could do at



that time I did; and this was to keep out of the charter



anything which could embarrass us regarding the question



in the future, steadily avoiding in every clause relating to



students the word ``man,'' and as steadily using the word



``person.''  In conversations between Mr. Cornell and



myself on this subject, I found that we agreed; and in our



addresses at the opening of the university we both alluded



to it, he favoring it in general terms, and I developing



sundry arguments calculated to prepare the way for future



action upon it.  At the close of the exercises Mr. John



McGraw, who was afterward so munificent toward us,



came to me and said:  ``My old business partner, Henry



Sage, who sat next me during the exercises this morning,



turned to me during your allusion to Mr. Cornell with



tears in his eyes, and said:  `John, we are scoundrels to



stand doing nothing while those men are killing themselves



to establish this university.' ''  In the afternoon Mr. Sage



himself came to me and said:  ``I believe you are right in



regard to admitting women, but you are evidently carrying



as many innovations just now as public opinion will



bear; when you are ready to move in the matter, let me



know.''







The following year came the first application of a young



woman for admission.  Her case was strong, for she presented



a certificate showing that she had passed the best



examination for the State scholarship in Cortland County;



and on this I admitted her.  Under the scholarship clause



in the charter I could not do otherwise.  On reporting



the case to the trustees, they supported me unanimously,



though some of them reluctantly.  The lady student



proved excellent from every point of view, and her



admission made a mere temporary ripple on the surface



of our affairs; but soon came a peculiar difficulty.  The



only rooms for students in those days on the University



Hill were in the barracks filled with young men; and therefore



the young woman took rooms in town, coming up to



lectures two or three times a day.  It was a hard struggle;



for the paths and roads leading to the university grounds,



four hundred feet above the valley, were not as in these



days, and the electric trolley had not been invented.  She



bore the fatigue patiently until winter set in; then she



came to me, expressing regret at her inability to toil up the



icy steep, and left us.  On my reporting this to the trustees,



Mr. Sage made his proposal.  I had expected from him



a professorship or a fellowship; but to my amazement



he offered to erect and endow a separate college for young



women in the university, and for this purpose to give us



two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.  A committee



of trustees having been appointed to examine and



report upon this proposal, I was made its chairman; and,



in company with Mr. Sage, visited various Western



institutions where experiments in the way of what was



called ``coeducation'' had been tried.  At Oberlin College



in Ohio two serious doubts were removed from my mind. 



The first of these was regarding the health of the young



women.  I had feared that in the hard work and vigorous



competitions of the university they would lose their physical



strength; but here we found that, with wise precautions,



the health of the young women had been quite equal



to that of the young men.  My other fear was that their



education with young men might cost some sacrifice of the



better general characteristics of both sexes; but on



studying the facts I became satisfied that the men had been



made more manly and the women more womanly.  As to



the manliness there could be little doubt; for the best



of all tests had been applied only a few years before, when



Oberlin College had poured forth large numbers of its



young men, as volunteers, into the Union army.  As to the



good effect upon women, it was easy to satisfy myself



when I met them, not only at the college, but in various



beautiful Western homes.







Very striking testimony was also given at the University



of Michigan.  Ten years earlier I had known that institution



well, and my professorship there, which lasted six



years, had made me well acquainted with the character and



spirit of its students; but, since my day, women had been



admitted, and some of the results of this change surprised



me much.  Formerly a professor's lecture- or recitation-



room had been decidedly a roughish place.  The men had



often been slouchy and unkempt.  Now all was quiet and



orderly, the dress of the students much neater; in fact, it



was the usual difference between assemblages of men alone



and of men and women together, or, as I afterward phrased



it, ``between the smoking-car and the car back of it.'' 



Perhaps the most convincing piece of testimony came from



an old janitor.  As I met him I said:  ``Well, J----, do the



students still make life a burden to you?''  ``Oh, no,'' he



answered; ``that is all gone by.  They can't rush each



other up and down the staircases or have boxing-matches



in the lobbies any longer, for the girls are there.''







My report went fully into the matter, favored the admission



of women, and was adopted by the trustees unanimously--



a thing which surprised me somewhat, since two



of them, Judge Folger and Mr. Erastus Brooks, were



among the most conservative men I have ever known.  The



general results were certainly fortunate; though one or



two minor consequences were, for a year or two, somewhat



disappointing.  Two or three of the faculty and a



considerable number of the students were greatly opposed to



the admission of women, a main cause of this being the



fear that it would discredit the institution in the eyes of



members of other universities, and the number of the



whole student body was consequently somewhat diminished;



but that feeling died away, the numbers became



larger than ever, and the system proved a blessing, not



only to the university, but to the State at large.  None of



the prophecies of evil so freely made by the opponents of



the measure have ever been fulfilled.  Every arrangement



was made in Mr. Sage's building to guard the health of the



young women; and no one will say that the manliness of



men or the womanliness of women has ever suffered in



consequence of the meeting of the two sexes in classrooms,



laboratories, chapel, or elsewhere.  From one evil



which was freely prophesied the university has been



singularly free.  It was declared that a great deal of



``spooning'' would result.  This has not been the case.  Both



sexes seem to have been on their guard against it; and,



although pleasant receptions have, as a rule, taken place



weekly at Sage College, and visits to its residents have



been permitted at suitable times, no embarrassing attachments



have resulted.







The main difficulties arose from a cause which proved



very short-lived.  Several of the young women who first



applied for admission held high ideas as to their rights. 



To them Sage College was an offense.  Its beautiful parlors,



conservatories, library, lecture-rooms, and lawns,



with its lady warden who served as guide, philosopher, and



friend, were all the result of a deep conspiracy against the



rights of women.  Again and again a committee of them



came to me, insisting that young women should be treated



exactly like young men; that there should be no lady warden;



that every one of them should be free to go and come



from Sage College at every hour in the twenty-four, as



young men were free to go and come from their dormitories. 



My answer was that the cases were not the same;



that when young women insisted on their right to come and



go at all times of the day and night, as they saw fit, without



permission, it was like their right to walk from the campus



to the beautiful point opposite us on the lake: the right they



undoubtedly had, but insurmountable obstacles were in the



way; and I showed them that a firm public opinion was



an invincible barrier to the liberties they claimed.  Still,



they were allowed advisory powers in the management of



the college; the great majority made wise use of this



right, and all difficulty was gradually overcome.







Closely connected with the erection of Sage College was



the establishment of Sage Chapel.  From the first I had



desired to have every working-day begun with a simple



religious service at which attendance should be voluntary,



and was glad to see that in the cheerless lecture-room



where this service was held there usually assembled a



goodly number of professors and students, in spite of the



early hour and long walk from town.  But for Sunday



there was no provision; and one day, on my discussing the



matter with Mr. Sage, he said that he would be glad to



establish a chapel on the university grounds for the general



use of professors and students, if I saw no objection.  This



proposal I heartily welcomed, but on two conditions: first,



that the chapel should never be delivered over to any one



sect; secondly, that students should be attracted, but not



coerced into it.  To these conditions Mr. Sage agreed, and



the building was erected.







As it approached completion there came a proposal



which opened a new era in our university life.  Mr. Dean



Sage, the eldest son of him who had given us the women's



college and the chapel, proposed to add an endowment for



a chaplaincy, and suggested that a clergyman of the Protestant



Episcopal Church be appointed to that office.  This



would have been personally pleasing to me; for, though



my churchmanship was ``exceeding broad,'' I was still



attracted to the church in which I was brought up, and felt



nowhere else so much at home.  But it seemed to me that



we had no right, under our charter, to give such prominence



to any single religious organization; and I therefore



proposed to the donor that the endowment be applied to a



preachership to be filled by leading divines of all



denominations.  In making this proposal I had in view, not only



the unsectarian feature embodied in our charter, but my



observation of university chaplaincies generally.  I had



noticed that, at various institutions, excellent clergymen,



good preachers, thorough scholars, charming men, when



settled as chaplains, had, as a rule, been unable to retain



their hold upon the great body of the students.  The



reason was not far to seek.  The average parish clergyman,





even though he be not a strong preacher or profound



scholar or brilliant talker, if he be at all fit for his



position, gradually wins the hearts of his congregation.  He



has baptized their children, married their young men and



maidens, buried their dead, rejoiced with those who have



rejoiced, and wept with those who have wept.  A strong



tie has thus grown up.  But such a tie between a chaplain



and bodies of students shifting from year to year, is, in



the vast majority of cases, impossible.  Hence it is that



even the most brilliant preachers settled in universities



have rapidly lost their prestige among the students.  I



remembered well how, at Geneva and at Yale, my college-



mates joked at the peculiarities of clergymen connected



with the college, who, before I entered it, had been objects



of my veneration.  I remembered that at Yale one of my



class was wont to arouse shouts of laughter by his droll



imitations of the prayers of the leading professors--



imitations in which their gestures, intonations, and bits of



rhetoric and oratory were most ludicrously caricatured.  I



remembered, too, how a college pastor, a man greatly



revered, was really driven out of the university pulpit by



a squib in a students' paper, and how several of his



successors had finally retreated into professorships in the



Divinity School; and I felt that leading men coming from



week to week from the outside world would be taken at



the value which the outside world puts upon them, and



that they would bring in a fresh atmosphere.  My expectations



were more than fulfilled.  The preachership having



been established, I sent invitations to eminent clergymen



along the whole gamut of belief, from the Roman Catholic



bishop of the diocese to the most advanced Protestants. 



The bishop answered me most courteously; but, to my



sincere regret, declined.  One or two bishops of the



Protestant Episcopal Church also made some difficulties at



first, but gradually they were glad to accept; for it was



felt to be a privilege and a pleasure to preach to so large



a body of open-minded young men, and the course of sermons



has for years deepened and strengthened what is best



in university life.  The whole system was indeed at first



attacked; and while we had formerly been charged with



godlessness, we were now charged with ``indifferentism''



--whatever that might mean.  But I have had the pleasure



of living to see this system adopted at other leading



universities of our country, and it is evidently on its way to



become the prevailing system among all of them.  I believe



that no pulpit in the United States has exercised a



more powerful influence for good.  Strong men have been



called to it from all the leading religious bodies; and they,



knowing the character of their audience, have never



advocated sectarianism, but have presented the great



fundamental truths upon which all religion must be based.







The first of these university preachers was Phillips



Brooks, and he made a very deep impression.  An interesting



material result of his first sermon was that Mr.



William Sage, the second son of our benefactor, came



forward at the close of the service, and authorized me to



secure a beautiful organ for the university chapel.[8]  In



my addresses to students I urged them to attend for



various good reasons, and, if for none of these, because a



man is but poorly educated who does not keep himself



abreast of the religious thought of his country.  Curious



was it to see Japanese students, some of them Buddhists,



very conscientious in their attendance, their eyes steadily



fixed upon the preacher.











[8] Sunday, June 13, 1875.











My selections for the preachership during the years of



my presidency were made with great care.  So far as possible,



I kept out all ``sensational preaching.''  I had no



wish to make the chapel a place for amusement or for



ground and lofty tumbling by clerical performers, and the



result was that its ennobling influence was steadily maintained.







Some other pulpits in the university town were not so



well guarded.  A revivalist, having been admitted to one



of them, attempted to make a sensation in various ways--



and one evening laid great stress on the declaration that



she was herself a brand plucked from the burning, and



that her parents were undoubtedly lost.  A few minutes



afterward, one of the Cornell students present, thinking



doubtless, that his time would be better employed upon his



studies, arose and walked down the aisle to the door.  At



this the preacher called out, ``There goes a young man



straight down to hell.''  Thereupon the student turned



instantly toward the preacher and asked quietly, ``Have



you any message to send to your father and mother?''







Our list of university preachers, both from our own and



other countries, as I look back upon it, is wonderful to me. 



Becoming acquainted with them, I have learned to love



very many men whom I previously distrusted, and have



come to see more and more the force of the saying, ``The



man I don't like is the man I don't know.''  Many of



their arguments have not appealed to me, but some



from which I have entirely dissented, have suggested



trains of profitable thought; in fact, no services have ever



done more for me, and, judging from the numbers who



have thronged the chapel, there has been a constant good



influence upon the faculty and students.







In connection with the chapel may be mentioned the



development of various religious associations, the first of



these being the Young Men's Christian Association.  Feeling



the importance of this, although never a member of it,



I entered heartily into its plan, and fitted up a hall for its



purposes.  As this hall had to serve also, during certain



evenings in the week, for literary societies, I took pains



to secure a series of large and fine historical engravings



from England, France, and Germany, among them some



of a decidedly religious cast, brought together after a



decidedly Broad-church fashion.  Of these, two, adjoining



each other, represented--the one, Luther discussing with



his associates his translation of the Bible, and the other,



St. Vincent de Paul comforting the poor and the afflicted;



and it was my hope that the juxtaposition of these two



pictures might suggest ideas of toleration in its best sense



to the young men and women who were to sit beneath



them.  About the room, between these engravings, I placed



some bronze statuettes, obtained in Europe, representing



men who had done noble work in the world; so that it



was for some years one of the attractions of the university.







Some years later came a gift very advantageous to this



side of university life.  A gentleman whom I had known



but slightly--Mr. Alfred S. Barnes of Brooklyn, a trustee



of the university--dropped in at my house one morning,



and seemed to have something on his mind.  By and by he



very modestly asked what I thought of his putting up a



building for the religious purposes of the students.  I



welcomed the idea joyfully; only expressing the hope that



it would not be tied up in any way, but open to all forms



of religious effort.  In this idea he heartily concurred, and



the beautiful building which bears his honored name was



the result,--one of the most perfect for its purposes that



can be imagined,--and as he asked me to write an inscription



for the corner-stone, I placed on it the words:  ``For



the Promotion of God's work among Men.''  This has



seemed, ever since, to be the key-note of the work done



in that building.







It has been, and is, a great pleasure to me to see young



men joining in religious effort; and I feel proud of the



fact that from this association at Cornell many strong and



earnest men have gone forth to good work as clergymen



in our own country and in others.







In the erection of the new group of buildings south of



the upper university quadrangle, as well as in building



the president's house hard by, an opportunity was offered



for the development of some minor ideas regarding the



evolution of university life at Cornell which I had deeply



at heart.  During my life at Yale, as well as during visits



to various other American colleges, I had been painfully



impressed by the lack of any development of that which



may be called the commemorative or poetical element.  In



the long row of barracks at Yale one longed for some



little bit of beauty, and hungered and thirsted for something



which connected the present with the past; but, with



the exception of the portraits in the Alumni Hall, there



was little more to feed the sense of beauty or to meet one 's



craving for commemoration of the past than in a cotton-



factory.  One might frequent the buildings at Yale or



Harvard or Brown, as they then were, for years, and see



nothing of an architectural sort which had been put in



its place for any other reason than bare utility.







Hence came an effort to promote at Cornell some development



of a better kind.  Among the first things I ordered



were portraits by competent artists of the leading non-



resident professors, Agassiz, Lowell, Curtis, and Goldwin



Smith.  This example was, from time to time, followed



by the faculty and trustees, the former commemorating



by portraits some of their more eminent members, and the



latter ordering portraits of some of those who had connected



their names with the university by benefactions or



otherwise, such as Mr. Cornell, Senator Morrill, Mr. Sage,



Mr. McGraw, and others.  The alumni and undergradu-



ates also added portraits of professors.  This custom has



proved very satisfactory; and the line of portraits hanging



in the library cannot fail to have an ennobling influence



on many of those who, day after day, sit beneath them.







But the erection of these new buildings--Sage College,



Sage Chapel, Barnes Hall, and, finally, the university



library--afforded an opportunity to do something of a



different sort.  There was a chance for some effort to



promote beauty of detail in construction, and, fortunately,



the forethought of Goldwin Smith helped us greatly in



this.  On his arrival in Ithaca, just after the opening of



the university, he had seen that we especially needed



thoroughly trained artisans; and he had written to his



friend Auberon Herbert, asking him to select and send



from England a number of the best he could find.  Nearly



all proved of value, and one of them gave himself to the



work in a way which won my heart.  This was Robert



Richardson, a stone-carver.  I at first employed him to



carve sundry capitals, corbels, and spandrels for the



president's house, which I was then building on the university



grounds; and this work was so beautifully done that, in



the erection of Sage College, another opportunity was



given him.  Any one who, to-day, studies the capitals of



the various columns, especially those in the porch, in the



loggia of the northern tower, and in some of the front



windows, will feel that he put his heart into the work.  He



wrought the flora of the region into these creations of



his, and most beautifully.  But best of all was his work



in the chapel.  The tracery of the windows, the capitals



of the columns, and the corbels supporting the beams of



the roof were masterpieces; and, in my opinion, no investment



of equal amount has proved to be of more value to



us, even for the moral and intellectual instruction of our



students, than these examples of a conscientious devotion



of genius and talent which he thus gave us.







The death of Mr. Cornell afforded an opportunity for



a further development in the same direction.  It was felt



that his remains ought to rest on that beautiful site, in the



midst of the institution he loved so well; and I proposed



that a memorial chapel be erected, beneath which his



remains and those of other benefactors of the university



might rest, and that it should be made beautiful.  This was



done.  The stone vaulting, the tracery, and other decorative



work, planned by our professor of architecture, and



carried out as a labor of love by Richardson, were all that



I could desire.  The trustees, entering heartily into the



plan, authorized me to make an arrangement with Story,



the American sculptor at Rome, to execute a reclining



statue of Mr. Cornell above the crypt where rest his



remains; and citizens of Ithaca also authorized me to



secure in London the memorial window beneath which the



statue is placed.  Other memorials followed, in the shape



of statues, busts, and tablets, as others who had been loved



and lost were laid to rest in the chapel crypt, until the



little building has become a place of pilgrimage.  In the



larger chapel, also, tablets and windows were erected from



time to time; and the mosaic and other decorations of the



memorial apse, recently erected as a place of repose for



the remains of Mr. and Mrs. Henry Sage, are a beautiful



development of the same idea.







So, too, upon the grounds, some effort was made to



connect the present with the past.  Here, as elsewhere in



our work, it seemed to me well to impress, upon the more



thinking students at least, the idea that all they saw



had not ``happened so,'' without the earnest agency of



human beings; but that it had been the result of the earnest



life-work of men and women, and that no life-work to



which a student might aspire could be more worthy.  In



carrying out this idea upon the ``campus'' Goldwin Smith



took the lead by erecting the stone seat which has now



stood there for over thirty years.  Other memorials



followed, among them a drinking-fountain, the stone bridge



across the Cascadilla, the memorial seat back of the



library, the entrance gateway, and the like; and, at the



lamented death of Richardson, another English stone



carver put his heart into some of the details of the newly



erected library.







Meanwhile, the grounds themselves became more and



more beautiful.  There was indeed one sad mistake; and



I feel bound, in self-defense, to state that it was made



during an absence of mine in Europe: this was the



erection of the chemical laboratory upon the promontory



northwest of the upper quadrangle.  That site afforded



one of the most beautiful views in our own or any other



country.  A very eminent American man of letters, who



had traveled much in other countries, said to me, as we



stood upon it, ``I have traveled hundreds of miles in



Europe to obtain views not half so beautiful as this.''  It



was the place to which Mr. Cornell took the trustees at



their first meeting in Ithaca, when their view from it led



them to choose the upper site for the university buildings



rather than the lower.  On this spot I remember once



seeing Phillips Brooks evidently overawed by the amazing



beauty of the scene spread out at his feet--the great



amphitheater to the south and southwest, the hills beyond,



and Cayuga Lake stretching to the north and northwest. 



But though this part of the grounds has been covered by



a laboratory which might better have been placed elsewhere,



much is still left, and this has been treated so as to



add to the natural charm of the surroundings.  With the



exception of the grounds of the State University of



Wisconsin and of the State University and Stanford



University in California, I know of none approaching in beauty



those of Cornell.  I feel bound to say, however, that there



is a danger.  Thus far, though mistakes have been made



here and there, little harm has been done which is irremediable. 



But this may not always be the case.  In my view,



one of the most important things to be done by the trustees



is to have a general plan most carefully decided upon



which shall be strictly conformed to in the erection of all



future buildings, no matter what their size or character



may be.  This has been urged from time to time, but



deferred.[9]  The experience of other universities in the



United States is most instructive in this respect.  Nearly



every one of them has suffered greatly from the want



of some such general plan.  One has but to visit almost



any one of them to see buildings of different materials and



styles--classical, Renaissance, Gothic, and nondescript



--thrown together in a way at times fairly ludicrous. 



Thomas Jefferson, in founding the University of Virginia,



was wiser; and his beautiful plan was carried out so fully,



under his own eyes, that it has never been seriously



departed from.  At Stanford University, thanks to the



wisdom of its founders, a most beautiful plan was adopted,



to which the buildings have been so conformed that



nothing could be more satisfactory; and recently another



noble Californian--Mrs. Hearst--has devoted a queenly



gift to securing a plan worthy of the University of



California.  At the opening of Cornell, as I have already



said, a general plan was determined upon, with an upper



quadrangle of stone, plain but dignified, to be at some



future time architecturally enriched, and with a freer



treatment of buildings on other parts of the grounds; but



there is always danger, and I trust that I may be allowed



to remind my associates and successors in the board of



trustees, of the necessity, in the future development of the



university, for a satisfactory plan, suitable to the site, to



be steadily kept in mind.











[9]  It has now--1904--been very intelligently developed.















CHAPTER XXIV







ROCKS, STORMS, AND PERIL--1868-1874







Thus far I have dwelt especially upon the steady



development of the university in its general system of



instruction, its faculty, its equipment, and its daily life;



but it must not be supposed that all was plain sailing.  On



the contrary, there were many difficulties, some



discouragements, and at times we passed through very deep



waters.  There were periods when ruin stared us in the



face--when I feared that my next move must be to close



our doors and announce the suspension of instruction. 



The most serious of these difficulties were financial.  Mr.



Cornell had indeed endowed the institution munificently,



and others followed his example: the number of men



and women who came forward to do something for it



was astonishing.  In addition to the great endowments



made by Mr. Cornell, Mr. Sage, Mr. McGraw, Mr. Sibley,



and others, which aggregated millions, there were smaller



gifts no less encouraging:  Goldwin Smith's gift of his



services, of his library, and of various sums to increase



it, rejoiced us all; and many other evidences of confidence,



in the shape of large collections of books and material,



cheered us in that darkest period; and from that day to



this such gifts have continued.







Some of the minor gifts were especially inspiring,



as showing the breadth of interest in our work.  One of



them warmed my heart when it was made, and for many



years afterward cheered me amid many cares.  As Mr. Sage



and myself were one day looking over matters upon the



grounds, there came along, in his rough wagon, a plain



farmer from a distant part of the county, a hard-working



man of very small means, who had clearly something



upon his mind.  Presently he said:  ``I would very much



like to do something for the university if I could.  I have



no money to give; but I have thought that possibly some



good elm-trees growing on my farm might be of use to



you, and if you wish them I will put them in the best



condition and bring them to you.''  This offer we gladly



accepted; the farmer brought the trees; they were carefully



planted; they have now, for over twenty years, given



an increasing and ever more beautiful shade to one of



the main university avenues; and in the line of them stands



a stone on which are engraved the words, ``Ostrander



Elms.''







But while all this encouraged us, there were things of a



very different sort.  Could the university have been



developed gradually, normally, and in obedience to a policy



determined solely by its president, trustees, and faculty



all would have gone easily.  But our charter made this



impossible.  Many departments must be put into operation



speedily, each one of them demanding large outlay for



buildings, equipment, and instruction.  From all parts of



the State came demands--some from friends, some from



enemies--urging us to do this, blaming us for not doing



that, and these utterances were echoed in various presses,



and re<e:>choed from the State legislature.  Every nerve had



to be strained to meet these demands.  I remember well



that when a committee of the Johns Hopkins trustees, just



before the organization of that university, visited Cornell



and looked over our work, one of them said to me:  ``We



at least have this in our favor: we can follow out our own



conceptions and convictions of what is best; we have no



need of obeying the injunctions of any legislature, the



beliefs of any religious body, or the clamors of any press;



we are free to do what we really believe best, as slowly,



and in such manner, as we see fit.''  As this was said a



feeling of deep envy came over me: our condition was the



very opposite of that.  In getting ready for the opening



of the university in October, 1868, as required by our



charter, large sums had to be expended on the site now so



beautiful, but then so unpromising.  Mr. Cornell's private



affairs, as also the constant demands upon him in locating



the university lands on the northern Mississippi, kept him



a large part of the time far from the university; and my



own university duties crowded every day.  The president



of a university in those days tilled a very broad field.  He



must give instruction, conduct examinations, preside over



the faculty, correspond with the trustees, address the



alumni in various parts of the country, respond to calls



for popular lectures, address the legislature from time



to time with reference to matters between the university



and the State and write for reviews and magazines; and



all this left little time for careful control of financial



matters.







In this condition of things Mr. Cornell had installed, as



``business manager,'' a gentleman supposed to be of wide



experience, who, in everything relating to the ordinary



financial management of the institution, was all-powerful. 



But as months went on I became uneasy.  Again and



again I urged that a careful examination be made of



our affairs, and that reports be laid before us which



we could clearly understand; but Mr. Cornell, always



optimistic, assured me that all was going well, and the



matter was deferred.  Finally, I succeeded in impressing



upon my colleagues in the board the absolute necessity



of an investigation.  It was made, and a condition of



things was revealed which at first seemed appalling.  The



charter of the university made the board of trustees



personally liable for any debt over fifty thousand dollars, and



we now discovered that we were owing more than three



times that amount.  At this Mr. Cornell made a characteristic



proposal.  He said:  ``I will pay half of this debt if



you can raise the other half.''  It seemed impossible.  Our



friends had been called upon so constantly and for such



considerable sums that it seemed vain to ask them for



more.  But we brought together at Albany a few of the



most devoted, and in fifteen minutes the whole amount was



subscribed: four members of the board of trustees agreed



to give each twenty thousand dollars; and this, with Mr.



Cornell's additional subscription; furnished the sum needed.







Then took place one of the things which led me later in



life, looking back over the history of the university, to



say that what had seemed to be our worst calamities



had generally proved to be our greatest blessings.  Among



these I have been accustomed to name the monstrous



McGuire attack in the Assembly on Mr. Cornell, which



greatly disheartened me for the moment, but which eventually



led the investigation committee not only to show



to the world Mr. Cornell's complete honesty and self-



sacrifice, but to recommend the measures which finally



transferred the endowment fund from the State to the



trustees, thus strengthening the institution greatly.  So



now a piece of good luck came out of this unexpected debt. 



As soon as the subscription was made, Mr. George W.



Schuyler, treasurer of the university, in drawing up the



deed of gift, ended it with words to the following effect: 



``And it is hereby agreed by the said Ezra Cornell, Henry



W. Sage, Hiram Sibley, John McGraw, and Andrew D.



White, that in case the said university shall ever be in



position to repay their said subscriptions, then and in that



case the said entire sum of one hundred and sixty thousand



dollars SHALL BE REPAID INTO A UNIVERSITY FUND FOR THE



CREATION OF FELLOWSHIPS AND SCHOLARSHIPS in the said



university.''  A general laugh arose among the subscribers, Mr.



McGraw remarking that this was rather offhand dealing



with us; but all took it in good part and signed the agreement. 



It is certain that not one of us then expected in his



lifetime to see the university able to repay the money; but,



within a few years, as our lands were sold at better prices



than we expected, the university was in condition to make



restitution.  At first some of the trustees demurred to



investing so large a sum in fellowships and scholarships, 



and my first effort to carry through a plan to this effect



failed; but at the next meeting I was successful; and so, in



this apparently calamitous revelation of debt began that



system of university fellowships and scholarships which



has done so much for the development of higher instruction



at Cornell.







So far as the university treasury was concerned,



matters thenceforth went on well.  Never again did the



university incur any troublesome debt; from that day to this



its finances have been so managed as to excite the



admiration even of men connected with the most successful and



best managed corporations of our country.  But financial



difficulties far more serious than the debt just referred



to arose in a different quarter.  In assuming the



expenses of locating and managing the university lands,



protecting them, paying taxes upon them, and the like, Mr.



Cornell had taken upon himself a fearful load, and it



pressed upon him heavily.  But this was not all.  It was,



indeed, far from the worst; for, in his anxiety to bring



the university town into easy connection with the railway



system of the State, he had invested very largely in local



railways leading into Ithaca.  Under these circumstances,



while he made heroic efforts and sacrifices, his relations



to the comptroller of the State, who still had in his charge



the land scrip of the university, became exceedingly



difficult.  At the very crisis of this difficulty Mr. Cornell's



hard work proved too much for him, and he lay down to



die.  The university affairs, so far as the land-grant fund



was concerned, seemed hopelessly entangled with his own



and with those of the State: it seemed altogether likely



that at his death the institution would be subjected to



years of litigation, to having its endowment tied up in the



courts, and to a suspension of its operations.  Happily, we



had as our adviser Francis Miles Finch, since justice of



the Court of Appeals of the State, and now dean of the



Law School--a man of noble character, of wonderfully



varied gifts, an admirable legal adviser, devoted personally



to Mr. Cornell, and no less devoted to the university.







He set at work to disentangle the business relations of



Mr. Cornell with the university, and of both with the State. 



Every member of the board, every member of Mr. Cornell's



family,--indeed, every member of the community,--



knew him to be honest, faithful, and capable.  He labored



to excellent purpose, and in due time the principal financial



members of the board were brought together at Ithaca



to consider his solution of the problem.  It was indeed



a dark day; we were still under the shadow of ``Black



Friday,'' the worst financial calamity in the history of



the nation.  Mr. Finch showed us that the first thing



needful was to raise about two hundred and fifty thousand



dollars, which could be tendered to the comptroller



of the State in cash, who, on receiving it, would



immediately turn over to the trustees the land scrip, which



it was all-important should be in our possession at the



death of Mr. Cornell.  He next pointed out the measures



to be taken in separating the interests of the university



from Mr. Cornell's estate, and these were provided



for.  The sum required for obtaining control of the land



scrip was immediately subscribed as a loan, virtually



without security, by members of the board then present;



though at that depressing financial period of the country



strong men went about with the best of securities, unable



to borrow money upon them.  In a few days Mr. Cornell



was dead; but the university was safe.  Mr. Finch's plan



worked well in every particular; and this, which appeared



likely to be a great calamity, resulted in the board of



trustees obtaining control of the landed endowment of



the institution, without which it must have failed.  But



the weeks while these negotiations were going on were



gloomy indeed for me; rarely in my life have I been so



unhappy.  That crisis of our fate was the winter of 1874. 



The weather was cold and depressing, my family far off in



Syracuse.  My main refuge then, as at sundry other times



of deep personal distress, was in work.  In the little southwest



room of the president's house, hardly yet finished and



still unfurnished, I made my headquarters.  Every morn-



ing a blazing fire was lighted on the hearth; every day I



devoted myself to university work and to study for my



lectures.  Happily, my subject interested me deeply.  It was



``The Age of Discovery''; and, surrounded with my books,



I worked on, forgetful, for the time, of the December



storms howling about the house, and of the still more fearful



storms beating against the university.  Three new lectures



having been thus added to my course on the Renaissance



period, I delivered them to my class; and, just as I



was finishing the last of them, a messenger came to tell me



that Mr. Cornell was dying.  Dismissing my students, I



hurried to his house, but was just too late; a few minutes



before my arrival his eyes had closed in death.  But his



work was done--nobly done.  As I gazed upon his dead



face on that 9th of December, 1874, I remember well



that my first feeling was that he was happily out of the



struggle; and that, wherever he might be, I could wish to



be still with him.  But there was no time for unavailing



regrets.  We laid him reverently and affectionately to



rest, in the midst of the scenes so dear to him, within the



sound of the university chimes he so loved to hear, and



pressed on with the work.







A few years later came another calamity, not, like the



others, touching the foundations and threatening the



existence of the university, yet hardly less crushing at the



time; indeed, with two exceptions, it was the most depressing



I have ever encountered.  At the establishment of the



university in Ithaca, one of the charter trustees who



showed himself especially munificent to the new enterprise



was Mr. John McGraw.  One morning, while I was in the



midst of the large collection of books sent by me from



Europe, endeavoring to bring them into some order before



the opening day, his daughter, Miss Jenny McGraw,



came in, and I had the pleasure of showing her some of



our more interesting treasures.  She was a woman of kind



and thoughtful nature, had traveled in her own country



and abroad to good purpose, and was evidently deeply



interested.  Next day her father met me and said:  ``Well,



you are pressing us all into the service.  Jenny came home



yesterday, and said very earnestly, `I wish that I could



do something to help on the university'; to which I



replied, `Very well.  Do anything you like; I shall be glad



to see you join in the work.' ''  The result was the gift



from her of the chime of bells which was rung at the



opening of the university, and which, with the additions



afterward made to it, have done beautiful service.  On the



bells she thus gave were inscribed the verses of the ninety-



fifth chant of Tennyson's ``In Memoriam''; and some



weeks afterward I had the pleasure of placing in her



hands what she considered an ample return for her gift--



a friendly letter from Tennyson himself, containing some



of the stanzas written out in his own hand.  So began her



interest in the university--an interest which never faltered.







A few years later she married one of our professors, an



old friend of mine, and her marriage proved exceedingly



happy; but, alas, its happiness was destined to be brief! 



Less than two years after her wedding day she was



brought home from Europe to breathe her last in her



husband's cottage on the university grounds, and was



buried from the beautiful residence which she had built



hard by, and had stored with works of art in every field.







At the opening of her will it was found that, while she



had made ample provision for all who were near and dear



to her, and for a multitude of charities, she had left to the



university very nearly two millions of dollars, a portion



of which was to be used for a student hospital, and the



bulk of the remainder, amounting to more than a million



and a half, for the university library.  Her husband



joined most heartily in her purpose, and all seemed ready



for carrying it out in a way which would have made



Cornell University, in that respect, unquestionably the



foremost on the American continent.  As soon as this



munificent bequest was announced, I asked our leading



lawyer, Judge Douglas Boardman, whether our charter allowed



the university to take it, calling his attention to the



fact that, like most of its kind in the State of New York,



it restricted the amount of property which the university



could hold, and reminding him that we had already exceeded



the limit thus allowed.  To this he answered that



the restriction was intended simply to prevent the endowment



of corporations beyond what the legislature might



think best for the commonwealth; that if the attorney-



general did not begin proceedings against us to prevent



our taking the property, no one else could; and that he



would certainly never trouble us.







In view of the fact that Judge Boardman had long



experience and was at the time judge of the Supreme Court



of the State, I banished all thought of difficulty; though



I could not but regret that, as he drew Mrs. Fiske's will,



and at the same time knew the restrictions of our charter,



he had not given us a hint, so that we could have had our



powers of holding property enlarged.  It would have been



perfectly easy to have the restrictions removed, and, as



a matter of fact, the legislature shortly afterward removed



them entirely, without the slightest objection; but this



action was too late to enable us to take the McGraw-Fiske



bequest.







About a fortnight after these assurances that we were



perfectly safe, Judge Boardman sent for me, and on meeting



him I found that he had discovered a decision of the



Court of Appeals--rendered a few years before--which



might prevent our accepting the bequest.







But there was still much hope of inducing the main heirs



to allow the purpose of Mrs. Fiske to be carried out.  Without



imputing any evil intentions to any person, I fully



believe--indeed, I may say I KNOW--that, had the matter



been placed in my hands, this vast endowment would have



been saved to us; but it was not so to be.  Personal



complications had arisen between the main heir and two of



our trustees which increased the embarrassments of the



situation.  It is needless to go into them now; let all that



be buried; but it may at least be said that day and night I



labored to make some sort of arrangement between the



principal heir and the university, and finally took the



steamer for Europe in order to meet him and see if some



arrangement could be made.  But personal bitterness had



entered too largely into the contest, and my efforts were



in vain.  Though our legal advisers insisted that the



university was sure of winning the case, we lost it in every



court--first in the Supreme Court of the State, then in the



Court of Appeals, and finally in the Supreme Court of the



United States.  To me all this was most distressing.  The



creation of such a library would have been the



culmination of my work; I could then have sung my Nunc



dimittis.  But the calamity was not without its



compensations.  When the worst was known, Mr. Henry W. Sage,



a lifelong friend of Mr. McGraw and of Mrs. Fiske, came



to my house, evidently with the desire to console me.  He



said:  ``Don't allow this matter to prey upon you; Jenny



shall have her library; it shall yet be built and well



endowed.''  He was true to his promise.  On the final



decision against us, he added to his previous large gifts to the



university a new donation of over six hundred thousand



dollars, half of which went to the erection of the present



library building, and the other half to an endowment fund. 



Professor Fiske also joined munificently in enlarging the



library, adding various gifts which his practised eye



showed him were needed, and, among these, two collections,



one upon Dante and one in Romance literature, each



the best of its kind in the United States.  Mr. William



Sage also added the noted library in German literature



of Professor Zarncke of Leipsic; and various others



contributed collections, larger or smaller, so that the library



has become, as a whole, one of the best in the country.  As



I visit it, there often come back vividly to me remembrances



of my college days, when I was wont to enter the



Yale library and stand amazed in the midst of the sixty



thousand volumes which had been brought together during



one hundred and fifty years.  They filled me with awe. 



But Cornell University has now, within forty years from



its foundation, accumulated very nearly three hundred



thousand volumes, many among them of far greater value



than anything contained in the Yale library of my day;



and as I revise these lines comes news that the will of



Professor Fiske, who recently died at Frankfort-on-the-Main,



gives to the library all of his splendid collections in Italian



history and literature at Florence, with the addition of



nearly half a million of dollars.







Beside these financial and other troubles, another class



of difficulties beset us, which were, at times, almost as



vexatious.  These were the continued attacks made by good



men in various parts of the State and Nation, who thought



they saw in Cornell a stronghold-first, of ideas in religion



antagonistic to their own; and secondly, of ideas in



education likely to injure their sectarian colleges.  From



the day when our charter was under consideration at



Albany they never relented, and at times they were violent. 



The reports of my inauguration speech were, in sundry



denominational newspapers, utterly distorted; far and



wide was spread the story that Mr. Cornell and myself



were attempting to establish an institution for the



propagation of ``atheism'' and ``infidelity.''  Certainly nothing



could have been further from the purpose of either of us. 



He had aided, and loved to aid, every form of Christianity;



I was myself a member of a Christian church and a trustee



of a denominational college.  Everything that we could do



in the way of reasoning with our assailants was in vain. 



In talking with students from time to time, I learned that,



in many cases, their pastors had earnestly besought them



to go to any other institution rather than to Cornell;



reports of hostile sermons reached us; bitter diatribes



constantly appeared in denominational newspapers, and



especially virulent were various addresses given on public



occasions in the sectarian colleges which felt themselves



injured by the creation of an unsectarian institution on so



large a scale.  Typical was the attack made by an eminent



divine who, having been installed as president over one



of the smaller colleges of the State, thought it his duty



to denounce me as an ``atheist,'' and to do this especially



in the city where I had formerly resided, and in the church



which some of my family attended.  I took no notice of the



charge, and pursued the even tenor of my way; but the



press took it up, and it recoiled upon the man who made it.







Perhaps the most comical of these attacks was one made



by a clergyman of some repute before the Presbyterian



Synod at Auburn in western New York.  This gentleman,



having attended one or two of the lectures by Agassiz



before our scientific students, immediately rushed off to



this meeting of his brethren, and insisted that the great



naturalist was ``preaching atheism and Darwinism'' at the



university.  He seemed about to make a decided impression,



when there arose a very dear old friend of mine, the



Rev. Dr. Sherman Canfield, pastor of the First Presbyterian



Church in Syracuse, who, fortunately, was a scholar



abreast of current questions.  Dr. Canfield quietly



remarked that he was amazed to learn that Agassiz had, in



so short a time, become an atheist, and not less astonished



to hear that he had been converted to Darwinism; that



up to that moment he had considered Agassiz a deeply



religious man, and also the foremost--possibly, indeed,



the last--great opponent of the Darwinian hypothesis.  He



therefore suggested that the resolution denouncing Cornell



University brought in by his reverend brother be



laid on the table to await further investigation.  It was



thus disposed of, and, in that region at least, it was never



heard of more.  Pleasing is it to me to chronicle the fact



that, at Dr. Canfield's death, he left to the university a



very important part of his library.







From another denominational college came an attack



on Goldwin Smith.  One of its professors published, in



the Protestant Episcopal ``Gospel Messenger,'' an attack



upon the university for calling into its faculty a



``Westminster Reviewer''; the fact being that Goldwin Smith



was at that time a member of the Church of England,



and had never written for the ``Westminster Review''



save in reply to one of its articles.  So, too, when there



were sculptured on the stone seat which he had ordered



carved for the university grounds the words, ``Above all



nations is humanity,'' there came an outburst.  Sundry



pastors, in their anxiety for the souls of the students, could



not tell whether this inscription savored more of atheism



or of pantheism.  Its simple significance--that the claims



of humanity are above those of nationality--entirely



escaped them.  Pulpit cushions were beaten in all parts of



the State against us, and solemn warnings were renewed



to students by their pastors to go anywhere for their



education rather than to Cornell.  Curiously, this fact became



not only a gratuitous, but an effective, advertisement:



many of the brightest men who came to us in those days



confessed to me that these attacks first directed their



attention to us.







We also owed some munificent gifts to this same cause. 



In two cases gentlemen came forward and made large



additions to our endowment as their way of showing



disbelief in these attacks or contempt for them.







Still, the attacks were vexatious even when impotent. 



Ingenious was the scheme carried out by a zealous young



clergyman settled for a short time in Ithaca.  Coming



one day into my private library, he told me that he was



very anxious to borrow some works showing the more



recent tendencies of liberal thought.  I took him to one



of my book-cases, in which, by the side of the works of



Bossuet and F<e'>nelon and Thomas Arnold and Robertson



of Brighton, he found those of Channing, Parker, Renan,



Strauss, and the men who, in the middle years of the last



century, were held to represent advanced thought.  He



looked them over for some time, made some excuse for not



borrowing any of them just then, and I heard nothing



more from him until there came, in a denominational



newspaper, his eloquent denunciation of me for possessing



such books.  Impressive, too, must have been the utterances



of an eminent ``revivalist'' who, in various Western



cities, loudly asserted that Mr. Cornell had died



lamenting his inability to base his university on atheism,



and that I had fled to Europe declaring that in America



an infidel university was, as yet, an impossibility.







For a long time I stood on the defensive, hoping that



the provisions made for the growth of religious life



among the students might show that we were not so



wicked as we were represented; but, as all this seemed



only to embitter our adversaries, I finally determined to



take the offensive, and having been invited to deliver a



lecture in the great hall of the Cooper Institute at New



York, took as my subject ``The Battle-fields of Science.'' 



In this my effort was to show how, in the supposed



interest of religion, earnest and excellent men, for many



ages and in many countries, had bitterly opposed various



advances in science and in education, and that such



opposition had resulted in most evil results, not only to science



and education, but to religion.  This lecture was published



in full, next day, in the ``New York Tribune''; extracts



from it were widely copied; it was asked for by lecture



associations in many parts of the country; grew first into



two magazine articles, then into a little book which was



widely circulated at home, reprinted in England with a



preface by Tyndall, and circulated on the Continent in



translations, was then expanded into a series of articles in



the ``Popular Science Monthly,'' and finally wrought into



my book on ``The Warfare of Science with Theology.'' 



In each of these forms my argument provoked attack; but



all this eventually created a reaction in our favor, even in



quarters where it was least expected.  One evidence of this



touched me deeply.  I had been invited to repeat the



lecture at New Haven, and on arriving there found a



large audience of Yale professors and students; but, most



surprising of all, in the chair for the evening, no less a



personage than my revered instructor, Dr. Theodore



Dwight Woolsey, president of the university.  He was of



a deeply religious nature; and certainly no man was ever



under all circumstances, more true to his convictions of



duty.  To be welcomed by him was encouragement indeed. 



He presented me cordially to the audience, and at the



close of my address made a brief speech, in which he



thoroughly supported my positions and bade me Godspeed. 



Few things in my life have so encouraged me.







Attacks, of course, continued for a considerable time,



some of them violent; but, to my surprise and satisfaction,



when my articles were finally brought together in



book form, the opposition seemed to have exhausted itself. 



There were even indications of approval in some quarters



where the articles composing it had previously been



attacked; and I received letters thoroughly in sympathy



with the work from a number of eminent Christian men,



including several doctors of divinity, and among these



two bishops, one of the Anglican and one of the American



Episcopal Church.







The final result was that slander against the university



for irreligion was confined almost entirely to very narrow



circles, of waning influence; and my hope is that,



as its formative ideas have been thus welcomed by various



leaders of thought, and have filtered down through the



press among the people at large, they have done something



to free the path of future laborers in the field of



science and education from such attacks as those which



Cornell was obliged to suffer.















CHAPTER XXV







CONCLUDING YEARS--1881-1885







To this work of pressing on the development of the



leading departments in the university, establishing



various courses of instruction, and warding off attacks as



best I could, was added the daily care of the regular and



steady administration of affairs, and in this my duty was



to co<o:>perate with the trustees, the faculty, and the



students.  The trustees formed a body differently composed



from any organization for university government up to



that time.  As a rule, such boards in the United States



were, in those days, self-perpetuating.  A man once elected



into one of them was likely to remain a trustee during



his natural life; and the result had been much dry-rot and,



frequently, a very sleepy condition of things in American



collegiate and university administration.  In drawing the



Cornell charter, we provided for a governing body by first



naming a certain number of high State officers--the



governor, lieutenant-governor, speaker, president of the State



Agricultural Society, and others; next, a certain number



of men of special fitness, who were to be elected by the



board itself; and, finally, a certain proportion elected by



the alumni from their own number.  Beside these, the eldest



male lineal descendant of Mr. Cornell, and the president



of the university, were trustees ex officio.  At the first



nomination of the charter trustees, Mr. Cornell proposed



that he should name half the number and I the other half. 



This was done, and pains were taken to select men accustomed



to deal with large affairs.  A very important provision 



was also made limiting their term of office to five years.







During the first nine years the chairmanship of the



board was held by Mr. Cornell, but at his death Mr.



Henry W. Sage was elected to it, who, as long as he lived,



discharged its duties with the greatest conscientiousness



and ability.  To the finances of the university he gave



that shrewd care which had enabled him to build up his



own immense business.  Freely and without compensation,



he bestowed upon the institution labor for which any



great business corporation would have gladly paid him



a very large sum.  For the immediate management, in



the intervals of the quarterly meetings of the board, an



executive committee of the trustees was created, which



also worked to excellent purpose.







The faculty, which was at first comparatively small,



was elected by the trustees upon my nomination.  In



deciding on candidates, I put no trust in mere paper



testimonials, no matter from what source; but always saw



the candidates themselves, talked with them, and then



secured confidential communications regarding them from



those who knew them best.  The results were good, and



to this hour I cherish toward the faculty, as toward the



trustees, a feeling of the deepest gratitude.  Throughout



all the hard work of that period they supported me heartily



and devotedly; without their devotion and aid, my



whole administration would have been an utter failure.







To several of these I have alluded elsewhere; but one



should be especially mentioned to whom every member of



the faculty must feel a debt of gratitude--Professor Hiram



Corson.  No one has done more to redress the balance



between the technical side and the humanities.  His writings,



lectures, and readings have been a solace and an



inspiration to many of us, both in the faculty and



among the students.  It was my remembrance of the effect



of his readings that caused me to urge, at a public address



at Yale in 1903, the establishment not only of professorships



but of readerships in English literature in all our



greater institutions, urging especially that the readers



thus called should every day present, with little if any note



or comment, the masterpieces of our literature.  I can



think of no provision which would do more to humanize



the great body of students, especially in these days when



other branches are so largely supplanting classical studies,



than such a continuous presentation of the treasures of our



language by a thoroughly good reader.  What is needed is



not more talk about literature, but the literature itself. 



And here let me recall an especial service of Professor



Corson which may serve as a hint to men and women of



light and leading in the higher education of our country. 



On sundry celebrations of Founder's Day, and on various



other commemorative occasions, he gave in the university



chapel recitals from Milton, Wordsworth, Tennyson, and



other poets of the larger inspiration, while organ



interludes were given from the great masters of music. 



Literature and music were thus made to do beautiful service as



yokefellows.  It has been my lot to enjoy in various capitals



of the modern world many of the things which men



who have a deep feeling for art most rejoice in, but never



have I known anything more uplifting and ennobling than



these simple commemorations.







From one evil which has greatly injured many American



university faculties, especially in the middle and western



States, we were virtually free.  This evil was the prevalence



of feuds between professors.  Throughout a large



part of the nineteenth century they were a great affliction. 



Twice the State University of Michigan was nearly



wrecked by them; for several years they nearly paralyzed



two or three of the New York colleges; and in one of



these a squabble between sundry professors and the



widow of a former president was almost fatal.  Another



of the larger colleges in the same State lost a very eminent



president from the same cause; and still another,



which had done excellent work, was dragged down and



for years kept down by a feud between its two foremost



professors.  In my day, at Yale, whenever there



was a sudden influx of students, and it was asked whence



they came, the answer always was, ``Another Western college



has burst up''; and the ``burst up'' had resulted,



almost without exception, from faculty quarrels.







In another chapter I have referred to one of these



explosions which, having blown out of a Western university



the president, the entire board of trustees, and all



the assistant professors and instructors, convulsed the



State for years.  I have known gifted members of faculties,



term after term, substitute for their legitimate work



impassioned appeals to their religious denominations,



through synods or conferences, and to the public at large



through the press,--their quarrels at last entangling other



professors and large numbers of students.







In my ``Plan of Organization'' I called attention to this



evil, and laid down the principle that ``the presence of no



professor, however gifted, is so valuable as peace and



harmony.''  The trustees acquiesced in this view, and from



the first it was understood that, at any cost, quarrels must



be prevented.  The result was that we never had any which



were serious, nor had we any in the board of trustees.  One



of the most satisfactory of all my reflections is that I never



had any ill relations with any member of either body; that



there was never one of them whom I did not look upon as



a friend.  My simple rule for the government of my own



conduct was that I had NO TIME for squabbling; that life



was not long enough for quarrels; and this became, I



think, the feeling among all of us who were engaged in the



founding and building of the university.







As regards the undergraduates, I initiated a system



which, so far as is known to me, was then new in American



institutions of learning.  At the beginning of every year,



and also whenever any special occasion seemed to require



it, I summoned the whole body of students and addressed



them at length on the condition of the university, on their



relations to it, and on their duties to it as well as to



themselves; and in all these addresses endeavored to bring



home to them the idea that under our system of giving to



the graduates votes in the election of trustees, and to



representative alumni seats in the governing board, the whole



student body had become, in a new sense, part of the



institution, and were to be held, to a certain extent,



responsible for it.  I think that all conversant with the history



of the university will agree that the results of thus taking



the students into the confidence of the governing



board were happy.  These results were shown largely



among the undergraduates, and even more strongly



among the alumni.  In all parts of the country alumni



associations were organized, and here again I found a



source of strength.  These associations held reunions during



every winter, and at least one banquet, at which the



president of the university was invited to be present.  So



far as possible, I attended these meetings, and made use



of them to strengthen the connection of the graduates with



their alma mater.







The administrative care of the university was very



engrossing.  With study of the various interests combined



within its organization; with the attendance on meetings



of trustees, executive committee, and faculty, and



discussion of important questions in each of these bodies--



with the general oversight of great numbers of students



in many departments and courses; with the constant



necessity of keeping the legislature and the State informed



as to the reasons of every movement, of meeting hostile



forces pressing us on every side, of keeping in touch with



our graduates throughout the country, there was much



to be done.  Trying also, at times, to a man never in



robust health was the duty of addressing various



assemblies of most dissimilar purposes.  Within the space



of two or three years I find mention in my diaries of a



large number of addresses which, as president of the



university, I could not refuse to give; among these, those



before the legislature of the State, on Technical Education;



before committees of Congress, on Agriculture and



Technical Instruction; before the Johns Hopkins University,



on Education with Reference to Political Life; before



the National Teachers' Association at Washington, on the



Relation of the Universities to the State School Systems;



before the American Social Science Association of New



York, on Sundry Reforms in University Management; before



the National Association of Teachers at Detroit, on



the Relations of Universities to Colleges; before four



thousand people at Cleveland, on the Education of the



Freedmen; before the Adalbert College, on the Concentration



of Means for the Higher Education; before the



State Teachers' Association at Saratoga, on Education



and Democracy; at the Centennial banquet at Philadelphia,



on the American Universities; and before my



class at Yale University, on the Message of the



Nineteenth Century to the Twentieth; besides many public



lectures before colleges, schools, and special assemblies. 



There seemed more danger of wearing out than of rusting



out, especially as some of these discourses provoked



attacks which must be answered.  Time also was required



for my duties as president of the American Social Science



Association, which lasted several years, and of the American



Historical Society, which, though less engrossing,



imposed for a time much responsibility.  Then, too, there



was another duty, constantly pressing, which I had



especially at heart.  The day had not yet arrived when the



president of the university could be released from his



duties as a professor.  I had, indeed, no wish for such



release; for, of all my duties, that of meeting my senior



students face to face in the lecture-room and interesting



them in the studies which most interested me, and which



seemed most likely to fit them to go forth and bring the



influence of the university to bear for good upon the country



at large, was that which I liked best.  The usual routine



of administrative cares was almost hateful to me,



and I delegated minor details, as far as possible, to those



better fitted to take charge of them--especially to the vice-



president and registrar and secretary of the faculty.  But



my lecture-room I loved.  Of all occupations, I know of



none more satisfactory than that of a university professor 



who feels that he is in right relations with his



students, that they welcome what he has to give them,



and that their hearts and minds are developed, day by



day, by the work which he most prizes.  I may justly say



that this pleasure was mine at the University of Michigan



and at Cornell University.  It was at times hard to



satisfy myself; for next to the pleasure of directing



younger minds is the satisfaction of fitting one's self to



do so.  During my ordinary working-day there was little



time for keeping abreast with the latest and best in my



department; but there were odds and ends of time, day



and night, and especially during my frequent journeys by



rail and steamer to meet engagements at distant points,



when I always carried with me a collection of books which



seemed to me most fitted for my purpose; and as I had



trained myself to be a rapid reader, these excursions gave



me many opportunities.







But some of these journeys were not well suited to



study.  During the first few years of the university,



being obliged to live in the barracks on the University Hill



under many difficulties, I could not have my family with



me, and from Saturday afternoon until Monday morning



was given to them at Syracuse.  In summer the journey



by Cayuga Lake to the New York Central train gave me



excellent opportunity for reading and even for writing. 



But in winter it was different.  None of the railways now



connecting the university town with the outside world



had then been constructed, save that to the southward;



and, therefore, during those long winters there was at



least twice a week a dreary drive in wagon or sleigh



sometimes taking all the better hours of the day, in order



to reach the train from Binghamton to Syracuse.  Coming



out of my lecture-room Friday evening or Saturday



morning, I was conveyed through nearly twenty-five miles



of mud and slush or sleet and snow.  On one journey my



sleigh was upset three times in the drifts which made the



roads almost impassable, and it required nearly ten hours



to make the entire journey.  The worst of it was that,



coming out of my heated lecture-room and taking an open



sleigh at Ithaca, or coming out of the heated cars and taking



it at Cortland, my throat became affected, and for



some years gave me serious trouble.







But my greater opportunities--those which kept me



from becoming a mere administrative machine--were



afforded by various vacations, longer or shorter.  During the



summer vacation, mainly passed at Saratoga and the seaside,



there was time for consecutive studies with reference



to my work, my regular lectures, and occasional addresses. 



But this was not all.  At three different times I



was summoned from university work to public duties. 



The first of these occasions was when I was appointed



by President Grant one of the commissioners to Santo



Domingo.  This appointment came when I was thoroughly



worn out with university work, and it gave me a chance



of great value physically and intellectually.  During four



months I was in a world of thought as different from



anything that I had before known as that wonderful island



in the Caribbean Sea is different in its climate from



the hills of central New York swept by the winds of



December.  And I had to deal with men very different



from the trustees, faculty, and students of Cornell.  This



episode certainly broadened my view as a professor, and



strengthened me for administrative duties.







The third of these long vacations was in 1879--80--81,



when President Hayes appointed me minister plenipotentiary



in Berlin.  My stay at that post, and especially



my acquaintance with leaders in German thought and with



professors at many of the Continental universities, did



much for me in many ways.







It may be thought strange that I could thus absent



myself from the university, but these absences really enabled



me to maintain my connection with the institution.  My



constitution, though elastic, was not robust; an uninterrupted



strain would have broken me, while variety of



occupation strengthened me.  Throughout my whole life



I have found the best of all medicines to be travel and



change of scene.  Another example of this was during my



stay of a year abroad as commissioner at the Paris



Exposition.  During that stay I prepared several additions



to my course of general lectures, and during my official



stay in Berlin added largely to my course on German



history.  But the change of work saved me: though minor



excursions were frequently given up to work with book



and pen, I returned from them refreshed and all the more



ready for administrative duties.







As to the effect of such absences upon the university,



I may say that it accorded with the theory which I held



tenaciously regarding the administration of the university



at that formative period.  I had observed in various



American colleges that a fundamental and most injurious



error was made in relieving trustees and faculty from



responsibility, and concentrating all in the president.  The



result, in many of these institutions, had been a sort of



atrophy,--the trustees and faculty being, whenever an



emergency arose, badly informed as to the affairs of their



institutions, and really incapable of managing them.  This



state of things was the most serious drawback to President



Tappan's administration at the University of Michigan,



and was the real cause of the catastrophe which



finally led to his break with the regents of that university,



and his departure to Europe, never to return.  Worse still



was the downfall of Union College, Schenectady, from



the position which it had held before the death of President



Nott.  Under Drs. Nott and Tappan the tendency in



the institutions above named was to make the trustees



in all administrative matters mere ciphers, and to make



the faculty more and more incapable of administering



discipline or conducting current university business.  That



system concentrated all knowledge of university affairs



and all power of every sort in the hands of the president,



and relieved trustees and faculty from everything except



nominal responsibility.  From the very beginning I



determined to prevent this state of things at Cornell.  Great



powers were indeed given me by the trustees, and I used



them; but in the whole course of my administration I



constantly sought to keep ample legislative powers in the



board of trustees and in the faculty.  I felt that the



university, to be successful, should not depend on the life and



conduct of any one man; that every one of those called to



govern and to manage it, whether president or professor,



should feel that he had powers and responsibilities in its



daily administration.  Therefore it was that I inserted in



the fundamental laws of the university a provision that



the confirmation by the trustees of all nominations of



professors should be by ballot; so that it might never be in



the power of the president or any other trustee unduly to



influence selections for such positions.  I also exerted



myself to provide that in calling new professors they should



be nominated by the president, not of his own will, but



with the advice of the faculty and should be confirmed by



the trustees.  I also provided that the elections of students



to fellowships and scholarships and the administration of



discipline should be decided by the faculty, and by ballot. 



The especial importance of this latter point will not



escape those conversant with university management.  I



insisted that the faculty should not be merely a committee



to register the decrees of the president, but that it should



have full legislative powers to discuss and to decide



university affairs.  Nor did I allow it to become a body



merely advisory:  I not only insisted that it should have



full legislative powers, but that it should be steadily



trained in the use of them.  On my nomination the trustees



elected from the faculty three gentlemen who had shown



themselves especially fitted for administrative work to the



positions of vice-president, registrar, and secretary; and



thenceforth the institution was no longer dependent on any



one man.  To the first of these positions was elected



Professor William Channing Russel; to the second, Professor



William Dexter Wilson; to the third, Professor George C.



Caldwell; and each discharged his duties admirably.







Of the last two of these I have already spoken, and here



some record should be made of the services rendered by



Dr. Russel.  He was among those chosen for the instructing



body at the very beginning.  Into all of his work he



brought a perfect loyalty to truth, with the trained



faculties of a lawyer in seeking it and the fearlessness of an



apostle in announcing it.  As to his success in this latter



field, there may be given, among other testimonies, that of



an unwilling witness--a young scholar of great strength



of mind, who, though he had taken deep offense at sundry



acts of the professor and never forgiven them, yet, after a



year in the historical lecture-rooms of the University of



Berlin, said to me:  ``I have attended here the lectures of



all the famous professors of history, and have heard few



who equal Professor Russel and none who surpass him in



ascertaining the really significant facts and in clearly



presenting them.''







In the vice-presidency of the faculty he also rendered



services of the greatest value.  No one was more devoted



than he to the university or more loyal to his associates. 



There was, indeed, some friction.  His cousin, James



Russell Lowell, once asked me regarding this, and my reply



was that it reminded me of a character in the ``Biglow



Papers'' who ``had a dre'dful winnin' way to make folks



hate him.''  This was doubtless an overstatement, but it



contained truth; for at times there was perhaps lacking in



his handling of delicate questions something of the suaviter



in modo.  His honest frankness was worthy of all



praise; but I once found it necessary to write him:  ``I am



sorry that you have thought it best to send me so unsparing



a letter, but no matter; write me as many as you like;



they will never break our friendship; only do not write



others in the same strain.''  This brought back from him



one of the kindest epistles imaginable.  Uncompromising



as his manner was, his services vastly outweighed all the



defects of his qualities; and among these services were



some of which the general public never dreamed.  I could



tell of pathetic devotion and self-sacrifice on his part, not



only to the university, but to individual students.  No



professor ever had a kindlier feeling toward any scholar in



need, sickness, or trouble.  Those who knew him best loved



him most; and, in the hard, early days of the university,



he especially made good his title to the gratitude of every



Cornellian, not only by his university work, but by his



unostentatious devotion to every deserving student.







As to my professorial work, I found in due time



effective aid in various young men who had been members of



my classes.  Of these were Charles Kendall Adams, who



afterward became my successor in the presidency of Cornell,



and George Lincoln Burr, who is now one of my successors



in the professorship of history.







Thus it was that from time to time I could be absent



with a feeling that all at the university was moving on



steadily and securely; with a feeling, indeed, that it was



something to have aided in creating an institution which



could move on steadily and securely, even when the hands



of those who had set it in motion had been removed.







There was, however, one temporary exception to the rule. 



During my absence as minister at Berlin trouble arose in



the governing board so serious that I resigned my diplomatic



post before my term of service was ended, and hastened



back to my university duties.  But no permanent



injury had been done; in fact, this experience, by



revealing weaknesses in sundry parts of our system, resulted



in permanent good.







Returning thus from Berlin, I threw myself into university



work more heartily than ever.  It was still difficult,



for our lands had not as yet been sold to any extent, and



our income was sadly insufficient.  The lands were steadily



increasing in value, and it was felt that it would be a great



error to dispose of them prematurely.  The work of providing



ways and means to meet the constantly increasing



demands of the institution was therefore severe, and the



loss of the great library bequest to the university also



tried me sorely; but I labored on, and at last, thanks to



the admirable service of Mr. Sage in the management of



the lands, the university was enabled to realize, for the



first time, a large capital from them.  Up to the year 1885



they had been a steady drain upon our resources; now



the sale of a fraction of them yielded a good revenue. 



For the first time there was something like ease in the



university finances.







Twenty years had now elapsed since I had virtually



begun my duties as president by drafting the university



charter and by urging it upon the legislature.  The four



years of work since my return from Berlin had tried me



severely; and more than that, I had made a pledge some



years before to the one who, of all in the world, had the



right to ask it, that at the close of twenty years of service



I would give up all administrative duties.  To this pledge



I was faithful, but with the feeling that it was at the



sacrifice of much.  The new endowment coming in from the



sale of lands offered opportunities which I had longed for



during many weary years; but I felt that it was best to



put the management into new hands.  There were changes



needed which were far more difficult for me to make than



for a new-comer--especially changes in the faculty, which



involved the severing of ties very dear to me.







At the annual commencement of 1885, the twenty years



from the granting of our charter having arrived, I



presented my resignation with the declaration that it must



be accepted.  It was accepted in such a way as to make



me very grateful to all connected with the institution:



trustees, faculty, and students were most kind to me.  As



regards the first of these bodies, I cannot resist the



temptation to mention two evidences of their feeling



which touched me deeply.  The first of these was the



proposal that I should continue as honorary president of



the university.  This I declined.  To hold such a position



would have been an injury to my successor; I knew well



that the time had come when he would be obliged to



grapple with questions which I had left unsettled from



a feeling that he would have a freer hand than I could have. 



But another tender made me I accepted: this was that I



should nominate my successor.  I did this, naming my old



student at the University of Michigan, who had succeeded



me there as professor of history--Charles Kendall Adams;



and so began a second and most prosperous administration. 







In thus leaving the presidency of the university, it



seemed to me that the time had come for carrying out a



plan formed long before--the transfer to the university



of my historical and general library, which had become



one of the largest and, in its field, one of the best



private collections of books in the United States.  The



trustees accepted it, providing a most noble room for it in



connection with the main university library and with the



historical lecture-rooms; setting apart, also, from their



resources, an ample sum, of which the income should be



used in maintaining the library, in providing a librarian,



in publishing a complete catalogue, and in making the



collection effective for historical instruction.  My only



connection with the university thenceforward was that of



a trustee and member of its executive committee.  In this



position it has been one of the greatest pleasures and



satisfactions of my life to note the large and steady



development of the institution during the two administrations



which have succeeded my own.  At the close of the



administration of President Adams, who had especially



distinguished himself in developing the law department and



various other important university interests, in strengthening



the connection of the institution with the State, and



in calling several most competent professors, he was



succeeded by a gentleman whose acquaintance I had made



during my stay as minister to Germany, he being at that



time a student at the University of Berlin,--Dr. Jacob



Gould Schurman, whose remarkable powers and gifts have



more than met the great expectations I then formed



regarding him, and have developed the university to a yet



higher point, so that its number of students is now, as I



revise these lines, over three thousand.  He, too, has been



called to important duties in the public service; and he



has just returned after a year of most valuable work as



president of the Commission of the United States to the



Philippine Islands, the university progressing during his



absence, and showing that it has a life of its own and is



not dependent even on the most gifted of presidents.







On laying down the duties of the university presidency,



it did not seem best to me to remain in its neighborhood



during the first year or two of the new administration. 



Any one who has ever been in a position similar



to mine at that period will easily understand the reason. 



It is the same which has led thoughtful men in the



churches to say that it is not well to have the old pastor



too near when the new pastor is beginning his duties. 



Obedient to this idea of leaving my successor a free hand, my



wife and myself took a leisurely journey through England,



France, and Italy, renewing old acquaintances and making



new friends.  Returning after a year, I settled down



again in the university, hoping to complete the book for



which I had been gathering materials and on which I had



been working steadily for some years, when there came the



greatest calamity of my life,--the loss of her who had been



my main support during thirty years,--and work became



for a time, an impossibility.  Again I became a wanderer,



going, in 1888, first to Scotland, and thence, being ordered



by physicians to the East, went again through France and



Italy, and extended the journey through Egypt, Greece



and Turkey.  Of the men and things which seemed most



noteworthy to me at that period I speak in other chapters.  



From the East I made my way leisurely to Paris, with



considerable stops at Buda-Pesth, Vienna, Ulm, Munich



Frankfort-on-the-Main, Paris, London, taking notes in



libraries, besides collecting books and manuscripts.







Returning to the United States in the autumn of 1889,



and settling down again in my old house at Cornell, I was



invited to give courses of historical lectures at various



American universities, especially one upon the ``Causes



of the French Revolution,'' at Johns Hopkins, Columbian



University in Washington, the University of Pennsylvania,



Tulane University in New Orleans, and Stanford



University in California.  Excursions to these institutions



opened a new epoch in my life; but of this I shall speak



elsewhere.







During this period of something over fifteen years, I



have been frequently summoned from these duties, which



were especially agreeable to me--first, in 1892, as minister



to Russia; next, in 1896, as a member of the Venezuelan



Commission at Washington; and, in 1897, as ambassador



to Germany.  I have found many men and things which



would seem likely to draw me away from my interest in



Cornell; but, after all, that which has for nearly forty



years held, and still holds, the deepest place in my



thoughts is the university which I aided to found.







Since resigning its presidency I have, in many ways,



kept in relations with it; and as I have, at various times,



returned from abroad and walked over its grounds,



visited its buildings, and lived among its faculty and



students, an enjoyment has been mine rarely vouchsafed



to mortals.  It has been like revisiting the earth after



leaving it.  The work to which I had devoted myself for



so many years, and with more earnestness than any other



which I have ever undertaken, though at times almost



with the energy of despair, I have now seen successful



beyond my dreams.  Above all, as I have seen the crowd



of students coming and going, I have felt assured that the



work is good.  It was with this feeling that, just before I



left the university for the embassy at Berlin, I erected at



the entrance of the university grounds a gateway, on



which I placed a paraphrase of a Latin inscription noted



by me, many years before, over the main portal of the



University of Padua, as follows:







   ``So enter that daily thou mayest become more learned



        and thoughtful;



     So depart that daily thou mayest become more useful



        to thy country and to mankind.''











I often recall the saying of St. Philip Neri, who, in the



days of the Elizabethan persecutions, was wont to gaze



at the students passing out from the gates of the English



College at Rome, on their way to Great Britain,



and to say:  ``I am feasting my eyes on those martyrs



yonder.''  My own feelings are like his, but happier:  I



feast my eyes on those youths going forth from Cornell



University into this new twentieth century to see great



things that I shall never see, and to make the new time



better than the old.







During my life, which is now extending beyond the



allotted span of threescore and ten, I have been engaged



after the manner of my countrymen, in many sorts of



work, have become interested in many conditions of men



have joined in many efforts which I hope have been of



use; but, most of all, I have been interested in the founding



and maintaining of Cornell University, and by the part I



have taken in that, more than by any other work of my life



I hope to be judged.
