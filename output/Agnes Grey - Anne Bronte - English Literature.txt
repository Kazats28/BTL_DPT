<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>CHAPTER XXV - CONCLUSION</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>'WELL, Agnes, you must not take such long walks again before



<P>breakfast,' said my mother, observing that I drank an extra cup of



<P>coffee and ate nothing - pleading the heat of the weather, and the



<P>fatigue of my long walk as an excuse.&nbsp; I certainly did feel



<P>feverish and tired too.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'You always do things by extremes:&nbsp; now, if you had taken a SHORT



<P>walk every morning, and would continue to do so, it would do you



<P>good.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, mamma, I will.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But this is worse than lying in bed or bending over your books:



<P>you have quite put yourself into a fever.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I won't do it again,' said I.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I was racking my brains with thinking how to tell her about Mr.



<P>Weston, for she must know he was coming to-morrow.&nbsp; However, I



<P>waited till the breakfast things were removed, and I was more calm



<P>and cool; and then, having sat down to my drawing, I began - 'I met



<P>an old friend on the sands to-day, mamma.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'An old friend!&nbsp; Who could it be?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Two old friends, indeed.&nbsp; One was a dog;' and then I reminded

her



<P>of Snap, whose history I had recounted before, and related the



<P>incident of his sudden appearance and remarkable recognition; 'and



<P>the other,' continued I, 'was Mr. Weston, the curate of Horton.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Mr. Weston!&nbsp; I never heard of him before.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes, you have:&nbsp; I've mentioned him several times, I believe:&nbsp;

but



<P>you don't remember.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I've heard you speak of Mr. Hatfield.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Mr. Hatfield was the rector, and Mr. Weston the curate:&nbsp; I used

to



<P>mention him sometimes in contradistinction to Mr. Hatfield, as



<P>being a more efficient clergyman.&nbsp; However, he was on the sands



<P>this morning with the dog - he had bought it, I suppose, from the



<P>rat-catcher; and he knew me as well as it did - probably through



<P>its means:&nbsp; and I had a little conversation with him, in the course



<P>of which, as he asked about our school, I was led to say something



<P>about you, and your good management; and he said he should like to



<P>know you, and asked if I would introduce him to you, if he should



<P>take the liberty of calling to-morrow; so I said I would.&nbsp; Was

I



<P>right?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Of course.&nbsp; What kind of a man is he?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'A very RESPECTABLE man, I think:&nbsp; but you will see him to-morrow.



<P>He is the new vicar of F-, and as he has only been there a few



<P>weeks, I suppose he has made no friends yet, and wants a little



<P>society.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The morrow came.&nbsp; What a fever of anxiety and expectation I was

in



<P>from breakfast till noon - at which time he made his appearance!



<P>Having introduced him to my mother, I took my work to the window,



<P>and sat down to await the result of the interview.&nbsp; They got on



<P>extremely well together - greatly to my satisfaction, for I had



<P>felt very anxious about what my mother would think of him.&nbsp; He

did



<P>not stay long that time:&nbsp; but when he rose to take leave, she said



<P>she should be happy to see him, whenever he might find it



<P>convenient to call again; and when he was gone, I was gratified by



<P>hearing her say, - 'Well!&nbsp; I think he's a very sensible man.&nbsp;

But



<P>why did you sit back there, Agnes,' she added, 'and talk so



<P>little?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Because you talked so well, mamma, I thought you required no



<P>assistance from me:&nbsp; and, besides, he was your visitor, not mine.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After that, he often called upon us - several times in the course



<P>of a week.&nbsp; He generally addressed most of his conversation to

my



<P>mother:&nbsp; and no wonder, for she could converse.&nbsp; I almost

envied



<P>the unfettered, vigorous fluency of her discourse, and the strong



<P>sense evinced by everything she said - and yet, I did not; for,



<P>though I occasionally regretted my own deficiencies for his sake,



<P>it gave me very great pleasure to sit and hear the two beings I



<P>loved and honoured above every one else in the world, discoursing



<P>together so amicably, so wisely, and so well.&nbsp; I was not always



<P>silent, however; nor was I at all neglected.&nbsp; I was quite as much



<P>noticed as I would wish to be:&nbsp; there was no lack of kind words

and



<P>kinder looks, no end of delicate attentions, too fine and subtle to



<P>be grasped by words, and therefore indescribable - but deeply felt



<P>at heart.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Ceremony was quickly dropped between us:&nbsp; Mr. Weston came as an



<P>expected guest, welcome at all times, and never deranging the



<P>economy of our household affairs.&nbsp; He even called me 'Agnes:' the



<P>name had been timidly spoken at first, but, finding it gave no



<P>offence in any quarter, he seemed greatly to prefer that



<P>appellation to 'Miss Grey;' and so did I.&nbsp; How tedious and gloomy



<P>were those days in which he did not come!&nbsp; And yet not miserable;



<P>for I had still the remembrance of the last visit and the hope of



<P>the next to cheer me.&nbsp; But when two or three days passed without

my



<P>seeing him, I certainly felt very anxious - absurdly, unreasonably



<P>so; for, of course, he had his own business and the affairs of his



<P>parish to attend to.&nbsp; And I dreaded the close of the holidays,

when



<P>MY business also would begin, and I should be sometimes unable to



<P>see him, and sometimes - when my mother was in the schoolroom -



<P>obliged to be with him alone:&nbsp; a position I did not at all desire,



<P>in the house; though to meet him out of doors, and walk beside him,



<P>had proved by no means disagreeable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One evening, however, in the last week of the vacation, he arrived



<P>- unexpectedly:&nbsp; for a heavy and protracted thunder-shower during



<P>the afternoon had almost destroyed my hopes of seeing him that day;



<P>but now the storm was over, and the sun was shining brightly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'A beautiful evening, Mrs. Grey!' said he, as he entered.&nbsp; 'Agnes,



<P>I want you to take a walk with me to - ' (he named a certain part



<P>of the coast - a bold hill on the land side, and towards the sea a



<P>steep precipice, from the summit of which a glorious view is to be



<P>had).&nbsp; 'The rain has laid the dust, and cooled and cleared the

air,



<P>and the prospect will be magnificent.&nbsp; Will you come?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Can I go, mamma?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes; to be sure.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I went to get ready, and was down again in a few minutes; though,



<P>of course, I took a little more pains with my attire than if I had



<P>merely been going out on some shopping expedition alone.&nbsp; The



<P>thunder-shower had certainly had a most beneficial effect upon the



<P>weather, and the evening was most delightful.&nbsp; Mr. Weston would



<P>have me to take his arm; he said little during our passage through



<P>the crowded streets, but walked very fast, and appeared grave and



<P>abstracted.&nbsp; I wondered what was the matter, and felt an indefinite



<P>dread that something unpleasant was on his mind; and vague



<P>surmises, concerning what it might be, troubled me not a little,



<P>and made me grave and silent enough.&nbsp; But these fantasies vanished



<P>upon reaching the quiet outskirts of the town; for as soon as we



<P>came within sight of the venerable old church, and the - hill, with



<P>the deep blue beyond it, I found my companion was cheerful enough.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I'm afraid I've been walking too fast for you, Agnes,' said he:



<P>'in my impatience to be rid of the town, I forgot to consult your



<P>convenience; but now we'll walk as slowly as you please.&nbsp; I see,

by



<P>those light clouds in the west, there will be a brilliant sunset,



<P>and we shall be in time to witness its effect upon the sea, at the



<P>most moderate rate of progression.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When we had got about half-way up the hill, we fell into silence



<P>again; which, as usual, he was the first to break.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'My house is desolate yet, Miss Grey,' he smilingly observed, 'and



<P>I am acquainted now with all the ladies in my parish, and several



<P>in this town too; and many others I know by sight and by report;



<P>but not one of them will suit me for a companion; in fact, there is



<P>only one person in the world that will:&nbsp; and that is yourself;

and



<P>I want to know your decision?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Are you in earnest, Mr. Weston?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'In earnest!&nbsp; How could you think I should jest on such a subject?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He laid his hand on mine, that rested on his arm:&nbsp; he must have



<P>felt it tremble - but it was no great matter now.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I hope I have not been too precipitate,' he said, in a serious



<P>tone.&nbsp; 'You must have known that it was not my way to flatter and



<P>talk soft nonsense, or even to speak the admiration that I felt;



<P>and that a single word or glance of mine meant more than the honied



<P>phrases and fervent protestations of most other men.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I said something about not liking to leave my mother, and doing



<P>nothing without her consent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I settled everything with Mrs. Grey, while you were putting on



<P>your bonnet,' replied he.&nbsp; 'She said I might have her consent,

if I



<P>could obtain yours; and I asked her, in case I should be so happy,



<P>to come and live with us - for I was sure you would like it better.



<P>But she refused, saying she could now afford to employ an



<P>assistant, and would continue the school till she could purchase an



<P>annuity sufficient to maintain her in comfortable lodgings; and,



<P>meantime, she would spend her vacations alternately with us and



<P>your sister, and should be quite contented if you were happy.&nbsp;

And



<P>so now I have overruled your objections on her account.&nbsp; Have you



<P>any other?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No - none.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'You love me then?' said be, fervently pressing my hand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here I pause.&nbsp; My Diary, from which I have compiled these pages,



<P>goes but little further.&nbsp; I could go on for years, but I will



<P>content myself with adding, that I shall never forget that glorious



<P>summer evening, and always remember with delight that steep hill,



<P>and the edge of the precipice where we stood together, watching the



<P>splendid sunset mirrored in the restless world of waters at our



<P>feet - with hearts filled with gratitude to heaven, and happiness,



<P>and love - almost too full for speech.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A few weeks after that, when my mother had supplied herself with an



<P>assistant, I became the wife of Edward Weston; and never have found



<P>cause to repent it, and am certain that I never shall.&nbsp; We have

had



<P>trials, and we know that we must have them again; but we bear them



<P>well together, and endeavour to fortify ourselves and each other



<P>against the final separation - that greatest of all afflictions to



<P>the survivor.&nbsp; But, if we keep in mind the glorious heaven beyond,



<P>where both may meet again, and sin and sorrow are unknown, surely



<P>that too may be borne; and, meantime, we endeavour to live to the



<P>glory of Him who has scattered so many blessings in our path.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Edward, by his strenuous exertions, has worked surprising reforms



<P>in his parish, and is esteemed and loved by its inhabitants - as he



<P>deserves; for whatever his faults may be as a man (and no one is



<P>entirely without), I defy anybody to blame him as a pastor, a



<P>husband, or a father.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Our children, Edward, Agnes, and little Mary, promise well; their



<P>education, for the time being, is chiefly committed to me; and they



<P>shall want no good thing that a mother's care can give.&nbsp; Our modest



<P>income is amply sufficient for our requirements:&nbsp; and by practising



<P>the economy we learnt in harder times, and never attempting to



<P>imitate our richer neighbours, we manage not only to enjoy comfort



<P>and contentment ourselves, but to have every year something to lay



<P>by for our children, and something to give to those who need it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And now I think I have said sufficient.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>MY father's mortal remains had been consigned to the tomb; and we,



<P>with sad faces and sombre garments, sat lingering over the frugal



<P>breakfast-table, revolving plans for our future life.&nbsp; My mother's



<P>strong mind had not given way beneath even this affliction:&nbsp; her



<P>spirit, though crushed, was not broken.&nbsp; Mary's wish was that I



<P>should go back to Horton Lodge, and that our mother should come and



<P>live with her and Mr. Richardson at the vicarage:&nbsp; she affirmed



<P>that he wished it no less than herself, and that such an



<P>arrangement could not fail to benefit all parties; for my mother's



<P>society and experience would be of inestimable value to them, and



<P>they would do all they could to make her happy.&nbsp; But no arguments



<P>or entreaties could prevail:&nbsp; my mother was determined not to go.



<P>Not that she questioned, for a moment, the kind wishes and



<P>intentions of her daughter; but she affirmed that so long as God



<P>spared her health and strength, she would make use of them to earn



<P>her own livelihood, and be chargeable to no one; whether her



<P>dependence would be felt as a burden or not.&nbsp; If she could afford



<P>to reside as a lodger in - vicarage, she would choose that house



<P>before all others as the place of her abode; but not being so



<P>circumstanced, she would never come under its roof, except as an



<P>occasional visitor:&nbsp; unless sickness or calamity should render

her



<P>assistance really needful, or until age or infirmity made her



<P>incapable of maintaining herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No, Mary,' said she, 'if Richardson and you have anything to



<P>spare, you must lay it aside for your family; and Agnes and I must



<P>gather honey for ourselves.&nbsp; Thanks to my having had daughters

to



<P>educate, I have not forgotten my accomplishments.&nbsp; God willing,

I



<P>will check this vain repining,' she said, while the tears coursed



<P>one another down her cheeks in spite of her efforts; but she wiped



<P>them away, and resolutely shaking back her head, continued, 'I will



<P>exert myself, and look out for a small house, commodiously situated



<P>in some populous but healthy district, where we will take a few



<P>young ladies to board and educate - if we can get them - and as



<P>many day pupils as will come, or as we can manage to instruct.



<P>Your father's relations and old friends will be able to send us



<P>some pupils, or to assist us with their recommendations, no doubt:



<P>I shall not apply to my own.&nbsp; What say you to it, Agnes? will you



<P>be willing to leave your present situation and try?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Quite willing, mamma; and the money I have saved will do to



<P>furnish the house.&nbsp; It shall be taken from the bank directly.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'When it is wanted:&nbsp; we must get the house, and settle on



<P>preliminaries first.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mary offered to lend the little she possessed; but my mother



<P>declined it, saying that we must begin on an economical plan; and



<P>she hoped that the whole or part of mine, added to what we could



<P>get by the sale of the furniture, and what little our dear papa had



<P>contrived to lay aside for her since the debts were paid, would be



<P>sufficient to last us till Christmas; when, it was hoped, something



<P>would accrue from our united labours.&nbsp; It was finally settled that



<P>this should be our plan; and that inquiries and preparations should



<P>immediately be set on foot; and while my mother busied herself with



<P>these, I should return to Horton Lodge at the close of my four



<P>weeks' vacation, and give notice for my final departure when things



<P>were in train for the speedy commencement of our school.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>We were discussing these affairs on the morning I have mentioned,



<P>about a fortnight after my father's death, when a letter was



<P>brought in for my mother, on beholding which the colour mounted to



<P>her face - lately pale enough with anxious watchings and excessive



<P>sorrow.&nbsp; 'From my father!' murmured she, as she hastily tore off



<P>the cover.&nbsp; It was many years since she had heard from any of her



<P>own relations before.&nbsp; Naturally wondering what the letter might



<P>contain, I watched her countenance while she read it, and was



<P>somewhat surprised to see her bite her lip and knit her brows as if



<P>in anger.&nbsp; When she had done, she somewhat irreverently cast it

on



<P>the table, saying with a scornful smile, - 'Your grandpapa has been



<P>so kind as to write to me.&nbsp; He says he has no doubt I have long



<P>repented of my "unfortunate marriage," and if I will only



<P>acknowledge this, and confess I was wrong in neglecting his advice,



<P>and that I have justly suffered for it, he will make a lady of me



<P>once again - if that be possible after my long degradation - and



<P>remember my girls in his will.&nbsp; Get my desk, Agnes, and send these



<P>things away:&nbsp; I will answer the letter directly.&nbsp; But first,

as I



<P>may be depriving you both of a legacy, it is just that I should



<P>tell you what I mean to say.&nbsp; I shall say that he is mistaken in



<P>supposing that I can regret the birth of my daughters (who have



<P>been the pride of my life, and are likely to be the comfort of my



<P>old age), or the thirty years I have passed in the company of my



<P>best and dearest friend; - that, had our misfortunes been three



<P>times as great as they were (unless they had been of my bringing



<P>on), I should still the more rejoice to have shared them with your



<P>father, and administered what consolation I was able; and, had his



<P>sufferings in illness been ten times what they wore, I could not



<P>regret having watched over and laboured to relieve them; - that, if



<P>he had married a richer wife, misfortunes and trials would no doubt



<P>have come upon him still; while I am egotist enough to imagine that



<P>no other woman could have cheered him through them so well:&nbsp; not



<P>that I am superior to the rest, but I was made for him, and he for



<P>me; and I can no more repent the hours, days, years of happiness we



<P>have spent together, and which neither could have had without the



<P>other, than I can the privilege of having been his nurse in



<P>sickness, and his comfort in affliction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Will this do, children? - or shall I say we are all very sorry for



<P>what has happened during the last thirty years, and my daughters



<P>wish they had never been born; but since they have had that



<P>misfortune, they will be thankful for any trifle their grandpapa



<P>will be kind enough to bestow?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Of course, we both applauded our mother's resolution; Mary cleared



<P>away the breakfast things; I brought the desk; the letter was



<P>quickly written and despatched; and, from that day, we heard no



<P>more of our grandfather, till we saw his death announced in the



<P>newspaper a considerable time after - all his worldly possessions,



<P>of course, being left to our wealthy unknown cousins.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>CHAPTER XVIII - MIRTH AND MOURNING</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>THE 1st of June arrived at last:&nbsp; and Rosalie Murray was transmuted



<P>into Lady Ashby.&nbsp; Most splendidly beautiful she looked in her



<P>bridal costume.&nbsp; Upon her return from church, after the ceremony,



<P>she came flying into the schoolroom, flushed with excitement, and



<P>laughing, half in mirth, and half in reckless desperation, as it



<P>seemed to me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Now, Miss Grey, I'm Lady Ashby!' she exclaimed.&nbsp; 'It's done, my



<P>fate is sealed:&nbsp; there's no drawing back now.&nbsp; I'm come to

receive



<P>your congratulations and bid you good-by; and then I'm off for



<P>Paris, Rome, Naples, Switzerland, London - oh, dear! what a deal I



<P>shall see and hear before I come back again.&nbsp; But don't forget

me:



<P>I shan't forget you, though I've been a naughty girl.&nbsp; Come, why



<P>don't you congratulate me?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I cannot congratulate you,' I replied, 'till I know whether this



<P>change is really for the better:&nbsp; but I sincerely hope it is; and

I



<P>wish you true happiness and the best of blessings.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, good-by, the carriage is waiting, and they're calling me.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She gave me a hasty kiss, and was hurrying away; but, suddenly



<P>returning, embraced me with more affection than I thought her



<P>capable of evincing, and departed with tears in her eyes.&nbsp; Poor



<P>girl!&nbsp; I really loved her then; and forgave her from my heart all



<P>the injury she had done me - and others also:&nbsp; she had not half



<P>known it, I was sure; and I prayed God to pardon her too.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>During the remainder of that day of festal sadness, I was left to



<P>my own devices.&nbsp; Being too much unhinged for any steady occupation,



<P>I wandered about with a book in my hand for several hours, more



<P>thinking than reading, for I had many things to think about.&nbsp; In



<P>the evening, I made use of my liberty to go and see my old friend



<P>Nancy once again; to apologize for my long absence (which must have



<P>seemed so neglectful and unkind) by telling her how busy I had



<P>been; and to talk, or read, or work for her, whichever might be



<P>most acceptable, and also, of course, to tell her the news of this



<P>important day:&nbsp; and perhaps to obtain a little information from

her



<P>in return, respecting Mr. Weston's expected departure.&nbsp; But of

this



<P>she seemed to know nothing, and I hoped, as she did, that it was



<P>all a false report.&nbsp; She was very glad to see me; but, happily,

her



<P>eyes were now so nearly well that she was almost independent of my



<P>services.&nbsp; She was deeply interested in the wedding; but while

I



<P>amused her with the details of the festive day, the splendours of



<P>the bridal party and of the bride herself, she often sighed and



<P>shook her head, and wished good might come of it; she seemed, like



<P>me, to regard it rather as a theme for sorrow than rejoicing.&nbsp;

I



<P>sat a long time talking to her about that and other things - but no



<P>one came.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Shall I confess that I sometimes looked towards the door with a



<P>half-expectant wish to see it open and give entrance to Mr. Weston,



<P>as had happened once before? and that, returning through the lanes



<P>and fields, I often paused to look round me, and walked more slowly



<P>than was at all necessary - for, though a fine evening, it was not



<P>a hot one - and, finally, felt a sense of emptiness and



<P>disappointment at having reached the house without meeting or even



<P>catching a distant glimpse of any one, except a few labourers



<P>returning from their work?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sunday, however, was approaching:&nbsp; I should see him then:&nbsp;

for now



<P>that Miss Murray was gone, I could have my old corner again.&nbsp; I



<P>should see him, and by look, speech, and manner, I might judge



<P>whether the circumstance of her marriage had very much afflicted



<P>him.&nbsp; Happily I could perceive no shadow of a difference:&nbsp;

he wore



<P>the same aspect as he had worn two months ago - voice, look,



<P>manner, all alike unchanged:&nbsp; there was the same keen-sighted,



<P>unclouded truthfulness in his discourse, the same forcible



<P>clearness in his style, the same earnest simplicity in all he said



<P>and did, that made itself, not marked by the eye and ear, but felt



<P>upon the hearts of his audience.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I walked home with Miss Matilda; but HE DID NOT JOIN US.&nbsp; Matilda



<P>was now sadly at a loss for amusement, and wofully in want of a



<P>companion:&nbsp; her brothers at school, her sister married and gone,



<P>she too young to be admitted into society; for which, from



<P>Rosalie's example, she was in some degree beginning to acquire a



<P>taste - a taste at least for the company of certain classes of



<P>gentlemen; at this dull time of year - no hunting going on, no



<P>shooting even - for, though she might not join in that, it was



<P>SOMETHING to see her father or the gamekeeper go out with the dogs,



<P>and to talk with them on their return, about the different birds



<P>they had bagged.&nbsp; Now, also, she was denied the solace which the



<P>companionship of the coachman, grooms, horses, greyhounds, and



<P>pointers might have afforded; for her mother having,



<P>notwithstanding the disadvantages of a country life, so



<P>satisfactorily disposed of her elder daughter, the pride of her



<P>heart had begun seriously to turn her attention to the younger;



<P>and, being truly alarmed at the roughness of her manners, and



<P>thinking it high time to work a reform, had been roused at length



<P>to exert her authority, and prohibited entirely the yards, stables,



<P>kennels, and coachhouse.&nbsp; Of course, she was not implicitly obeyed;



<P>but, indulgent as she had hitherto been, when once her spirit was



<P>roused, her temper was not so gentle as she required that of her



<P>governesses to be, and her will was not to be thwarted with



<P>impunity.&nbsp; After many a scene of contention between mother and



<P>daughter, many a violent outbreak which I was ashamed to witness,



<P>in which the father's authority was often called in to confirm with



<P>oaths and threats the mother's slighted prohibitions - for even HE



<P>could see that 'Tilly, though she would have made a fine lad, was



<P>not quite what a young lady ought to be' - Matilda at length found



<P>that her easiest plan was to keep clear of the forbidden regions;



<P>unless she could now and then steal a visit without her watchful



<P>mother's knowledge.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amid all this, let it not be imagined that I escaped without many a



<P>reprimand, and many an implied reproach, that lost none of its



<P>sting from not being openly worded; but rather wounded the more



<P>deeply, because, from that very reason, it seemed to preclude self-



<P>defence.&nbsp; Frequently, I was told to amuse Miss Matilda with other



<P>things, and to remind her of her mother's precepts and



<P>prohibitions.&nbsp; I did so to the best of my power:&nbsp; but she

would not



<P>be amused against her will, and could not against her taste; and



<P>though I went beyond mere reminding, such gentle remonstrances as I



<P>could use were utterly ineffectual.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'DEAR Miss Grey! it is the STRANGEST thing.&nbsp; I suppose you can't



<P>help it, if it's not in your nature - but I WONDER you can't win



<P>the confidence of that girl, and make your society at LEAST as



<P>agreeable to her as that of Robert or Joseph!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'They can talk the best about the things in which she is most



<P>interested,' I replied.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well! that is a strange confession, HOWEVER, to come from her



<P>GOVERNESS!&nbsp; Who is to form a young lady's tastes, I wonder, if

the



<P>governess doesn't do it?&nbsp; I have known governesses who have so



<P>completely identified themselves with the reputation of their young



<P>ladies for elegance and propriety in mind and manners, that they



<P>would blush to speak a word against them; and to hear the slightest



<P>blame imputed to their pupils was worse than to be censured in



<P>their own persons - and I really think it very natural, for my



<P>part.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Do you, ma'am?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes, of course:&nbsp; the young lady's proficiency and elegance is

of



<P>more consequence to the governess than her own, as well as to the



<P>world.&nbsp; If she wishes to prosper in her vocation she must devote



<P>all her energies to her business:&nbsp; all her ideas and all her



<P>ambition will tend to the accomplishment of that one object.&nbsp; When



<P>we wish to decide upon the merits of a governess, we naturally look



<P>at the young ladies she professes to have educated, and judge



<P>accordingly.&nbsp; The JUDICIOUS governess knows this:&nbsp; she knows

that,



<P>while she lives in obscurity herself, her pupils' virtues and



<P>defects will be open to every eye; and that, unless she loses sight



<P>of herself in their cultivation, she need not hope for success.



<P>You see, Miss Grey, it is just the same as any other trade or



<P>profession:&nbsp; they that wish to prosper must devote themselves body



<P>and soul to their calling; and if they begin to yield to indolence



<P>or self-indulgence they are speedily distanced by wiser



<P>competitors:&nbsp; there is little to choose between a person that ruins



<P>her pupils by neglect, and one that corrupts them by her example.



<P>You will excuse my dropping these little hints:&nbsp; you know it is

all



<P>for your own good.&nbsp; Many ladies would speak to you much more



<P>strongly; and many would not trouble themselves to speak at all,



<P>but quietly look out for a substitute.&nbsp; That, of course, would

be



<P>the EASIEST plan:&nbsp; but I know the advantages of a place like this



<P>to a person in your situation; and I have no desire to part with



<P>you, as I am sure you would do very well if you will only think of



<P>these things and try to exert yourself a LITTLE more:&nbsp; then, I

am



<P>convinced, you would SOON acquire that delicate tact which alone is



<P>wanting to give you a proper influence over the mind of your



<P>pupil.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I was about to give the lady some idea of the fallacy of her



<P>expectations; but she sailed away as soon as she had concluded her



<P>speech.&nbsp; Having said what she wished, it was no part of her plan

to



<P>await my answer:&nbsp; it was my business to hear, and not to speak.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>However, as I have said, Matilda at length yielded in some degree



<P>to her mother's authority (pity it had not been exerted before);



<P>and being thus deprived of almost every source of amusement, there



<P>was nothing for it but to take long rides with the groom and long



<P>walks with the governess, and to visit the cottages and farmhouses



<P>on her father's estate, to kill time in chatting with the old men



<P>and women that inhabited them.&nbsp; In one of these walks, it was our



<P>chance to meet Mr. Weston.&nbsp; This was what I had long desired; but



<P>now, for a moment, I wished either he or I were away:&nbsp; I felt my



<P>heart throb so violently that I dreaded lest some outward signs of



<P>emotion should appear; but I think he hardly glanced at me, and I



<P>was soon calm enough.&nbsp; After a brief salutation to both, he asked



<P>Matilda if she had lately heard from her sister.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes,' replied she.&nbsp; 'She was at Paris when she wrote, and very



<P>well, and very happy.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She spoke the last word emphatically, and with a glance



<P>impertinently sly.&nbsp; He did not seem to notice it, but replied,

with



<P>equal emphasis, and very seriously -

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I hope she will continue to be so.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Do you think it likely?' I ventured to inquire:&nbsp; for Matilda had



<P>started off in pursuit of her dog, that was chasing a leveret.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I cannot tell,' replied he.&nbsp; 'Sir Thomas may be a better man than



<P>I suppose; but, from all I have heard and seen, it seems a pity



<P>that one so young and gay, and - and interesting, to express many



<P>things by one word - whose greatest, if not her only fault, appears



<P>to be thoughtlessness - no trifling fault to be sure, since it



<P>renders the possessor liable to almost every other, and exposes him



<P>to so many temptations - but it seems a pity that she should be



<P>thrown away on such a man.&nbsp; It was her mother's wish, I suppose?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes; and her own too, I think, for she always laughed at my



<P>attempts to dissuade her from the step.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'You did attempt it?&nbsp; Then, at least, you will have the



<P>satisfaction of knowing that it is no fault of yours, if any harm



<P>should come of it.&nbsp; As for Mrs. Murray, I don't know how she can



<P>justify her conduct:&nbsp; if I had sufficient acquaintance with her,



<P>I'd ask her.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'It seems unnatural:&nbsp; but some people think rank and wealth the



<P>chief good; and, if they can secure that for their children, they



<P>think they have done their duty.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'True:&nbsp; but is it not strange that persons of experience, who have



<P>been married themselves, should judge so falsely?'&nbsp; Matilda now



<P>came panting back, with the lacerated body of the young hare in her



<P>hand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Was it your intention to kill that hare, or to save it, Miss



<P>Murray?' asked Mr. Weston, apparently puzzled at her gleeful



<P>countenance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I pretended to want to save it,' she answered, honestly enough,



<P>'as it was so glaringly out of season; but I was better pleased to



<P>see it lolled.&nbsp; However, you can both witness that I couldn't help



<P>it:&nbsp; Prince was determined to have her; and he clutched her by

the



<P>back, and killed her in a minute!&nbsp; Wasn't it a noble chase?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Very! for a young lady after a leveret.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a quiet sarcasm in the tone of his reply which was not



<P>lost upon her; she shrugged her shoulders, and, turning away with a



<P>significant 'Humph!' asked me how I had enjoyed the fun.&nbsp; I replied



<P>that I saw no fun in the matter; but admitted that I had not



<P>observed the transaction very narrowly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Didn't you see how it doubled - just like an old hare? and didn't



<P>you hear it scream?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I'm happy to say I did not.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'It cried out just like a child.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Poor little thing!&nbsp; What will you do with it?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Come along - I shall leave it in the first house we come to.&nbsp;

I



<P>don't want to take it home, for fear papa should scold me for



<P>letting the dog kill it.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Weston was now gone, and we too went on our way; but as we



<P>returned, after having deposited the hare in a farm-house, and



<P>demolished some spice-cake and currant-wine in exchange, we met him



<P>returning also from the execution of his mission, whatever it might



<P>be.&nbsp; He carried in his hand a cluster of beautiful bluebells, which



<P>he offered to me; observing, with a smile, that though he had seen



<P>so little of me for the last two months, he had not forgotten that



<P>blue-bells were numbered among my favourite flowers.&nbsp; It was done



<P>as a simple act of goodwill, without compliment or remarkable



<P>courtesy, or any look that could be construed into 'reverential,



<P>tender adoration' (VIDE Rosalie Murray); but still, it was



<P>something to find my unimportant saying so well remembered:&nbsp; it

was



<P>something that he had noticed so accurately the time I had ceased



<P>to be visible.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I was told,' said he, 'that you were a perfect bookworm, Miss



<P>Grey:&nbsp; so completely absorbed in your studies that you were lost

to



<P>every other pleasure.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes, and it's quite true!' cried Matilda.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No, Mr. Weston:&nbsp; don't believe it:&nbsp; it's a scandalous libel.



<P>These young ladies are too fond of making random assertions at the



<P>expense of their friends; and you ought to be careful how you



<P>listen to them.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I hope THIS assertion is groundless, at any rate.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Why?&nbsp; Do you particularly object to ladies studying?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No; but I object to anyone so devoting himself or herself to



<P>study, as to lose sight of everything else.&nbsp; Except under peculiar



<P>circumstances, I consider very close and constant study as a waste



<P>of time, and an injury to the mind as well as the body.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, I have neither the time nor the inclination for such



<P>transgressions.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>We parted again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well! what is there remarkable in all this?&nbsp; Why have I recorded



<P>it?&nbsp; Because, reader, it was important enough to give me a cheerful



<P>evening, a night of pleasing dreams, and a morning of felicitous



<P>hopes.&nbsp; Shallow-brained cheerfulness, foolish dreams, unfounded



<P>hopes, you would say; and I will not venture to deny it:



<P>suspicions to that effect arose too frequently in my own mind.&nbsp;

But



<P>our wishes are like tinder:&nbsp; the flint and steel of circumstances



<P>are continually striking out sparks, which vanish immediately,



<P>unless they chance to fall upon the tinder of our wishes; then,



<P>they instantly ignite, and the flame of hope is kindled in a



<P>moment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But alas! that very morning, my flickering flame of hope was



<P>dismally quenched by a letter from my mother, which spoke so



<P>seriously of my father's increasing illness, that I feared there



<P>was little or no chance of his recovery; and, close at hand as the



<P>holidays were, I almost trembled lest they should come too late for



<P>me to meet him in this world.&nbsp; Two days after, a letter from Mary



<P>told me his life was despaired of, and his end seemed fast



<P>approaching.&nbsp; Then, immediately, I sought permission to anticipate



<P>the vacation, and go without delay.&nbsp; Mrs. Murray stared, and



<P>wondered at the unwonted energy and boldness with which I urged the



<P>request, and thought there was no occasion to hurry; but finally



<P>gave me leave:&nbsp; stating, however, that there was 'no need to be

in



<P>such agitation about the matter - it might prove a false alarm



<P>after all; and if not - why, it was only in the common course of



<P>nature:&nbsp; we must all die some time; and I was not to suppose myself



<P>the only afflicted person in the world;' and concluding with saying



<P>I might have the phaeton to take me to O-.&nbsp; 'And instead of



<P>REPINING, Miss Grey, be thankful for the PRIVILEGES you enjoy.



<P>There's many a poor clergyman whose family would be plunged into



<P>ruin by the event of his death; but you, you see, have influential



<P>friends ready to continue their patronage, and to show you every



<P>consideration.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I thanked her for her 'consideration,' and flew to my room to make



<P>some hurried preparations for my departure.&nbsp; My bonnet and shawl



<P>being on, and a few things hastily crammed into my largest trunk, I



<P>descended.&nbsp; But I might have done the work more leisurely, for

no



<P>one else was in a hurry; and I had still a considerable time to



<P>wait for the phaeton.&nbsp; At length it came to the door, and I was



<P>off:&nbsp; but, oh, what a dreary journey was that! how utterly



<P>different from my former passages homewards!&nbsp; Being too late for



<P>the last coach to -, I had to hire a cab for ten miles, and then a



<P>car to take me over the rugged hills.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was half-past ten before I reached home.&nbsp; They were not in bed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>My mother and sister both met me in the passage - sad - silent -



<P>pale!&nbsp; I was so much shocked and terror-stricken that I could not



<P>speak, to ask the information I so much longed yet dreaded to



<P>obtain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Agnes!' said my mother, struggling to repress some strong emotion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, Agnes!' cried Mary, and burst into tears.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'How is he?' I asked, gasping for the answer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Dead!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was the reply I had anticipated:&nbsp; but the shock seemed none

the



<P>less tremendous.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>CHAPTER XXIV - THE SANDS</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>OUR school was not situated in the heart of the town:&nbsp; on entering



<P>A- from the north-west there is a row of respectable-looking



<P>houses, on each side of the broad, white road, with narrow slips of



<P>garden-ground before them, Venetian blinds to the windows, and a



<P>flight of steps leading to each trim, brass-handled door.&nbsp; In one



<P>of the largest of these habitations dwelt my mother and I, with



<P>such young ladies as our friends and the public chose to commit to



<P>our charge.&nbsp; Consequently, we were a considerable distance from

the



<P>sea, and divided from it by a labyrinth of streets and houses.&nbsp;

But



<P>the sea was my delight; and I would often gladly pierce the town to



<P>obtain the pleasure of a walk beside it, whether with the pupils,



<P>or alone with my mother during the vacations.&nbsp; It was delightful

to



<P>me at all times and seasons, but especially in the wild commotion



<P>of a rough sea-breeze, and in the brilliant freshness of a summer



<P>morning.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I awoke early on the third morning after my return from Ashby Park



<P>- the sun was shining through the blind, and I thought how pleasant



<P>it would be to pass through the quiet town and take a solitary



<P>ramble on the sands while half the world was in bed.&nbsp; I was not



<P>long in forming the resolution, nor slow to act upon it.&nbsp; Of course



<P>I would not disturb my mother, so I stole noiselessly downstairs,



<P>and quietly unfastened the door.&nbsp; I was dressed and out, when the



<P>church clock struck a quarter to six.&nbsp; There was a feeling of



<P>freshness and vigour in the very streets; and when I got free of



<P>the town, when my foot was on the sands and my face towards the



<P>broad, bright bay, no language can describe the effect of the deep,



<P>clear azure of the sky and ocean, the bright morning sunshine on



<P>the semicircular barrier of craggy cliffs surmounted by green



<P>swelling hills, and on the smooth, wide sands, and the low rocks



<P>out at sea - looking, with their clothing of weeds and moss, like



<P>little grass-grown islands - and above all, on the brilliant,



<P>sparkling waves.&nbsp; And then, the unspeakable purity - and freshness



<P>of the air!&nbsp; There was just enough heat to enhance the value of

the



<P>breeze, and just enough wind to keep the whole sea in motion, to



<P>make the waves come bounding to the shore, foaming and sparkling,



<P>as if wild with glee.&nbsp; Nothing else was stirring - no living



<P>creature was visible besides myself.&nbsp; My footsteps were the first



<P>to press the firm, unbroken sands; - nothing before had trampled



<P>them since last night's flowing tide had obliterated the deepest



<P>marks of yesterday, and left them fair and even, except where the



<P>subsiding water had left behind it the traces of dimpled pools and



<P>little running streams.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Refreshed, delighted, invigorated, I walked along, forgetting all



<P>my cares, feeling as if I had wings to my feet, and could go at



<P>least forty miles without fatigue, and experiencing a sense of



<P>exhilaration to which I had been an entire stranger since the days



<P>of early youth.&nbsp; About half-past six, however, the grooms began

to



<P>come down to air their masters' horses - first one, and then



<P>another, till there were some dozen horses and five or six riders:



<P>but that need not trouble me, for they would not come as far as the



<P>low rocks which I was now approaching.&nbsp; When I had reached these,



<P>and walked over the moist, slippery sea-weed (at the risk of



<P>floundering into one of the numerous pools of clear, salt water



<P>that lay between them), to a little mossy promontory with the sea



<P>splashing round it, I looked back again to see who next was



<P>stirring.&nbsp; Still, there were only the early grooms with their



<P>horses, and one gentleman with a little dark speck of a dog running



<P>before him, and one water-cart coming out of the town to get water



<P>for the baths.&nbsp; In another minute or two, the distant bathing



<P>machines would begin to move, and then the elderly gentlemen of



<P>regular habits and sober quaker ladies would be coming to take



<P>their salutary morning walks.&nbsp; But however interesting such a scene



<P>might be, I could not wait to witness it, for the sun and the sea



<P>so dazzled my eyes in that direction, that I could but afford one



<P>glance; and then I turned again to delight myself with the sight



<P>and the sound of the sea, dashing against my promontory - with no



<P>prodigious force, for the swell was broken by the tangled sea-weed



<P>and the unseen rocks beneath; otherwise I should soon have been



<P>deluged with spray.&nbsp; But the tide was coming in; the water was



<P>rising; the gulfs and lakes were filling; the straits were



<P>widening:&nbsp; it was time to seek some safer footing; so I walked,



<P>skipped, and stumbled back to the smooth, wide sands, and resolved



<P>to proceed to a certain bold projection in the cliffs, and then



<P>return.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Presently, I heard a snuffling sound behind me and then a dog came



<P>frisking and wriggling to my feet.&nbsp; It was my own Snap - the little



<P>dark, wire-haired terrier!&nbsp; When I spoke his name, he leapt up

in



<P>my face and yelled for joy.&nbsp; Almost as much delighted as himself,

I



<P>caught the little creature in my arms, and kissed him repeatedly.



<P>But how came he to be there?&nbsp; He could not have dropped from the



<P>sky, or come all that way alone:&nbsp; it must be either his master,

the



<P>rat-catcher, or somebody else that had brought him; so, repressing



<P>my extravagant caresses, and endeavouring to repress his likewise,



<P>I looked round, and beheld - Mr. Weston!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Your dog remembers you well, Miss Grey,' said he, warmly grasping



<P>the hand I offered him without clearly knowing what I was about.



<P>'You rise early.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Not often so early as this,' I replied, with amazing composure,



<P>considering all the circumstances of the case.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'How far do you purpose to extend your walk?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I was thinking of returning - it must be almost time, I think.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He consulted his watch - a gold one now - and told me it was only



<P>five minutes past seven.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But, doubtless, you have had a long enough walk,' said he, turning



<P>towards the town, to which I now proceeded leisurely to retrace my



<P>steps; and he walked beside me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'In what part of the town do you live?' asked he.&nbsp; 'I never could



<P>discover.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Never could discover?&nbsp; Had he endeavoured to do so then?&nbsp;

I told



<P>him the place of our abode.&nbsp; He asked how we prospered in our



<P>affairs.&nbsp; I told him we were doing very well - that we had had

a



<P>considerable addition to our pupils after the Christmas vacation,



<P>and expected a still further increase at the close of this.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'You must be an accomplished instructor,' he observed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No, it is my mother,' I replied; 'she manages things so well, and



<P>is so active, and clever, and kind.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I should like to know your mother.&nbsp; Will you introduce me to her



<P>some time, if I call?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes, willingly.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And will you allow me the privilege of an old friend, of looking



<P>in upon you now and then?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes, if - I suppose so.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was a very foolish answer, but the truth was, I considered



<P>that I had no right to invite anyone to my mother's house without



<P>her knowledge; and if I had said, 'Yes, if my mother does not



<P>object,' it would appear as if by his question I understood more



<P>than was expected; so, SUPPOSING she would not, I added, 'I suppose



<P>so:' but of course I should have said something more sensible and



<P>more polite, if I had had my wits about me.&nbsp; We continued our walk



<P>for a minute in silence; which, however, was shortly relieved (no



<P>small relief to me) by Mr. Weston commenting upon the brightness of



<P>the morning and the beauty of the bay, and then upon the advantages



<P>A- possessed over many other fashionable places of resort.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'You don't ask what brings me to A- ' said he.&nbsp; 'You can't suppose



<P>I'm rich enough to come for my own pleasure.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I heard you had left Horton.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'You didn't hear, then, that I had got the living of F-?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>F- was a village about two miles distant from A-.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No,' said I; 'we live so completely out of the world, even here,



<P>that news seldom reaches me through any quarter; except through the



<P>medium of the - GAZETTE.&nbsp; But I hope you like your new parish;

and



<P>that I may congratulate you on the acquisition?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I expect to like my parish better a year or two hence, when I have



<P>worked certain reforms I have set my heart upon - or, at least,



<P>progressed some steps towards such an achievement.&nbsp; But you may



<P>congratulate me now; for I find it very agreeable to HAVE a parish



<P>all to myself, with nobody to interfere with me - to thwart my



<P>plans or cripple my exertions:&nbsp; and besides, I have a respectable



<P>house in a rather pleasant neighbourhood, and three hundred pounds



<P>a year; and, in fact, I have nothing but solitude to complain of,



<P>and nothing but a companion to wish for.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He looked at me as he concluded:&nbsp; and the flash of his dark eyes



<P>seemed to set my face on fire; greatly to my own discomfiture, for



<P>to evince confusion at such a juncture was intolerable.&nbsp; I made

an



<P>effort, therefore, to remedy the evil, and disclaim all personal



<P>application of the remark by a hasty, ill-expressed reply, to the



<P>effect that, if he waited till he was well known in the



<P>neighbourhood, he might have numerous opportunities for supplying



<P>his want among the residents of F- and its vicinity, or the



<P>visitors of A-, if he required so ample a choice:&nbsp; not considering



<P>the compliment implied by such an assertion, till his answer made



<P>me aware of it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I am not so presumptuous as to believe that,' said he, 'though you



<P>tell it me; but if it were so, I am rather particular in my notions



<P>of a companion for life, and perhaps I might not find one to suit



<P>me among the ladies you mention.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'If you require perfection, you never will.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I do not - I have no right to require it, as being so far from



<P>perfect myself.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here the conversation was interrupted by a water-cart lumbering



<P>past us, for we were now come to the busy part of the sands; and,



<P>for the next eight or ten minutes, between carts and horses, and



<P>asses, and men, there was little room for social intercourse, till



<P>we had turned our backs upon the sea, and begun to ascend the



<P>precipitous road leading into the town.&nbsp; Here my companion offered



<P>me his arm, which I accepted, though not with the intention of



<P>using it as a support.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'You don't often come on to the sands, I think,' said he, 'for I



<P>have walked there many times, both morning and evening, since I



<P>came, and never seen you till now; and several times, in passing



<P>through the town, too, I have looked about for your school - but I



<P>did not think of the - Road; and once or twice I made inquiries,



<P>but without obtaining the requisite information.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When we had surmounted the acclivity, I was about to withdraw my



<P>arm from his, but by a slight tightening of the elbow was tacitly



<P>informed that such was not his will, and accordingly desisted.



<P>Discoursing on different subjects, we entered the town, and passed



<P>through several streets.&nbsp; I saw that he was going out of his way

to



<P>accompany me, notwithstanding the long walk that was yet before



<P>him; and, fearing that he might be inconveniencing himself from



<P>motives of politeness, I observed - 'I fear I am taking you out of



<P>your way, Mr. Weston - I believe the road to F- lies quite in



<P>another direction.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I'll leave you at the end of the next street,' said he.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And when will you come to see mamma?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'To-morrow - God willing.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The end of the next street was nearly the conclusion of my journey.



<P>He stopped there, however, bid me good-morning, and called Snap,



<P>who seemed a little doubtful whether to follow his old mistress or



<P>his new master, but trotted away upon being summoned by the latter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I won't offer to restore him to you, Miss Grey,' said Mr. Weston,



<P>smiling, 'because I like him.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, I don't want him,' replied I, 'now that he has a good master;



<P>I'm quite satisfied.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'You take it for granted that I am a good one, then?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The man and the dog departed, and I returned home, full of



<P>gratitude to heaven for so much bliss, and praying that my hopes



<P>might not again be crushed.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>CHAPTER VIII - THE 'COMING OUT'</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>AT eighteen, Miss Murray was to emerge from the quiet obscurity of



<P>the schoolroom into the full blaze of the fashionable world - as



<P>much of it, at least, as could be had out of London; for her papa



<P>could not be persuaded to leave his rural pleasures and pursuits,



<P>even for a few weeks' residence in town.&nbsp; She was to make her debut



<P>on the third of January, at a magnificent ball, which her mamma



<P>proposed to give to all the nobility and choice gentry of O- and



<P>its neighbourhood for twenty miles round.&nbsp; Of course, she looked



<P>forward to it with the wildest impatience, and the most extravagant



<P>anticipations of delight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Miss Grey,' said she, one evening, a month before the all-



<P>important day, as I was perusing a long and extremely interesting



<P>letter of my sister's - which I had just glanced at in the morning



<P>to see that it contained no very bad news, and kept till now,



<P>unable before to find a quiet moment for reading it, - 'Miss Grey,



<P>do put away that dull, stupid letter, and listen to me!&nbsp; I'm sure



<P>my talk must be far more amusing than that.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She seated herself on the low stool at my feet; and I, suppressing



<P>a sigh of vexation, began to fold up the epistle.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'You should tell the good people at home not to bore you with such



<P>long letters,' said she; 'and, above all, do bid them write on



<P>proper note-paper, and not on those great vulgar sheets.&nbsp; You



<P>should see the charming little lady-like notes mamma writes to her



<P>friends.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'The good people at home,' replied I, 'know very well that the



<P>longer their letters are, the better I like them.&nbsp; I should be

very



<P>sorry to receive a charming little lady-like note from any of them;



<P>and I thought you were too much of a lady yourself, Miss Murray, to



<P>talk about the "vulgarity" of writing on a large sheet of paper.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, I only said it to tease you.&nbsp; But now I want to talk about



<P>the ball; and to tell you that you positively must put off your



<P>holidays till it is over.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Why so? - I shall not be present at the ball.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No, but you will see the rooms decked out before it begins, and



<P>hear the music, and, above all, see me in my splendid new dress.&nbsp;

I



<P>shall be so charming, you'll be ready to worship me - you really



<P>must stay.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I should like to see you very much; but I shall have many



<P>opportunities of seeing you equally charming, on the occasion of



<P>some of the numberless balls and parties that are to be, and I



<P>cannot disappoint my friends by postponing my return so long.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, never mind your friends!&nbsp; Tell them we won't let you go.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But, to say the truth, it would be a disappointment to myself:&nbsp;

I



<P>long to see them as much as they to see me - perhaps more.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, but it is such a short time.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Nearly a fortnight by my computation; and, besides, I cannot bear



<P>the thoughts of a Christmas spent from home:&nbsp; and, moreover, my



<P>sister is going to be married.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Is she - when?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Not till next month; but I want to be there to assist her in



<P>making preparations, and to make the best of her company while we



<P>have her.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Why didn't you tell me before?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I've only got the news in this letter, which you stigmatize as



<P>dull and stupid, and won't let me read.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'To whom is she to be married?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'To Mr. Richardson, the vicar of a neighbouring parish.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Is he rich?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No; only comfortable.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Is he handsome?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No; only decent.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Young?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No; only middling.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, mercy! what a wretch!&nbsp; What sort of a house is it?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'A quiet little vicarage, with an ivy-clad porch, an old-fashioned



<P>garden, and - '

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, stop! - you'll make me sick.&nbsp; How CAN she bear it?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I expect she'll not only be able to bear it, but to be very happy.



<P>You did not ask me if Mr. Richardson were a good, wise, or amiable



<P>man; I could have answered Yes, to all these questions - at least



<P>so Mary thinks, and I hope she will not find herself mistaken.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But - miserable creature! how can she think of spending her life



<P>there, cooped up with that nasty old man; and no hope of change?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'He is not old:&nbsp; he's only six or seven and thirty; and she herself



<P>is twenty-eight, and as sober as if she were fifty.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh! that's better then - they're well matched; but do they call



<P>him the "worthy vicar"?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I don't know; but if they do, I believe he merits the epithet.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Mercy, how shocking! and will she wear a white apron and make pies



<P>and puddings?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I don't know about the white apron, but I dare say she will make



<P>pies and puddings now and then; but that will be no great hardship,



<P>as she has done it before.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And will she go about in a plain shawl, and a large straw bonnet,



<P>carrying tracts and bone soup to her husband's poor parishioners?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I'm not clear about that; but I dare say she will do her best to



<P>make them comfortable in body and mind, in accordance with our



<P>mother's example.'

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>CHAPTER XX - THE FAREWELL</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>A HOUSE in A-, the fashionable watering-place, was hired for our



<P>seminary; and a promise of two or three pupils was obtained to



<P>commence with.&nbsp; I returned to Horton Lodge about the middle of



<P>July, leaving my mother to conclude the bargain for the house, to



<P>obtain more pupils, to sell off the furniture of our old abode, and



<P>to fit out the new one.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>We often pity the poor, because they have no leisure to mourn their



<P>departed relatives, and necessity obliges them to labour through



<P>their severest afflictions:&nbsp; but is not active employment the best



<P>remedy for overwhelming sorrow - the surest antidote for despair?



<P>It may be a rough comforter:&nbsp; it may seem hard to be harassed with



<P>the cares of life when we have no relish for its enjoyments; to be



<P>goaded to labour when the heart is ready to break, and the vexed



<P>spirit implores for rest only to weep in silence:&nbsp; but is not



<P>labour better than the rest we covet? and are not those petty,



<P>tormenting cares less hurtful than a continual brooding over the



<P>great affliction that oppresses us?&nbsp; Besides, we cannot have cares,



<P>and anxieties, and toil, without hope - if it be but the hope of



<P>fulfilling our joyless task, accomplishing some needful project, or



<P>escaping some further annoyance.&nbsp; At any rate, I was glad my mother



<P>had so much employment for every faculty of her action-loving



<P>frame.&nbsp; Our kind neighbours lamented that she, once so exalted

in



<P>wealth and station, should be reduced to such extremity in her time



<P>of sorrow; but I am persuaded that she would have suffered thrice



<P>as much had she been left in affluence, with liberty to remain in



<P>that house, the scene of her early happiness and late affliction,



<P>and no stern necessity to prevent her from incessantly brooding



<P>over and lamenting her bereavement.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I will not dilate upon the feelings with which I left the old



<P>house, the well-known garden, the little village church - then



<P>doubly dear to me, because my father, who, for thirty years, had



<P>taught and prayed within its walls, lay slumbering now beneath its



<P>flags - and the old bare hills, delightful in their very



<P>desolation, with the narrow vales between, smiling in green wood



<P>and sparkling water - the house where I was born, the scene of all



<P>my early associations, the place where throughout life my earthly



<P>affections had been centred; - and left them to return no more!



<P>True, I was going back to Horton Lodge, where, amid many evils, one



<P>source of pleasure yet remained:&nbsp; but it was pleasure mingled with



<P>excessive pain; and my stay, alas! was limited to six weeks.&nbsp; And



<P>even of that precious time, day after day slipped by and I did not



<P>see him:&nbsp; except at church, I never saw him for a fortnight after



<P>my return.&nbsp; It seemed a long time to me:&nbsp; and, as I was often

out



<P>with my rambling pupil, of course hopes would keep rising, and



<P>disappointments would ensue; and then, I would say to my own heart,



<P>'Here is a convincing proof - if you would but have the sense to



<P>see it, or the candour to acknowledge it - that he does not care



<P>for you.&nbsp; If he only thought HALF as much about you as you do about



<P>him, he would have contrived to meet you many times ere this:&nbsp;

you



<P>must know that, by consulting your own feelings.&nbsp; Therefore, have



<P>done with this nonsense:&nbsp; you have no ground for hope:&nbsp; dismiss,

at



<P>once, these hurtful thoughts and foolish wishes from your mind, and



<P>turn to your own duty, and the dull blank life that lies before



<P>you.&nbsp; You might have known such happiness was not for you.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But I saw him at last.&nbsp; He came suddenly upon me as I was crossing



<P>a field in returning from a visit to Nancy Brown, which I had taken



<P>the opportunity of paying while Matilda Murray was riding her



<P>matchless mare.&nbsp; He must have heard of the heavy loss I had



<P>sustained:&nbsp; he expressed no sympathy, offered no condolence:&nbsp;

but



<P>almost the first words he uttered were, - 'How is your mother?'



<P>And this was no matter-of -course question, for I never told him



<P>that I had a mother:&nbsp; he must have learned the fact from others,

if



<P>he knew it at all; and, besides, there was sincere goodwill, and



<P>even deep, touching, unobtrusive sympathy in the tone and manner of



<P>the inquiry.&nbsp; I thanked him with due civility, and told him she

was



<P>as well as could be expected.&nbsp; 'What will she do?' was the next



<P>question.&nbsp; Many would have deemed it an impertinent one, and given



<P>an evasive reply; but such an idea never entered my head, and I



<P>gave a brief but plain statement of my mother's plans and



<P>prospects.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Then you will leave this place shortly?' said he.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes, in a month.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He paused a minute, as if in thought.&nbsp; When he spoke again, I hoped



<P>it would be to express his concern at my departure; but it was only



<P>to say, - 'I should think you will be willing enough to go?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes - for some things,' I replied.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'For SOME things only - I wonder what should make you regret it?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I was annoyed at this in some degree; because it embarrassed me:&nbsp;

I



<P>had only one reason for regretting it; and that was a profound



<P>secret, which he had no business to trouble me about.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Why,' said I - 'why should you suppose that I dislike the place?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'You told me so yourself,' was the decisive reply.&nbsp; 'You said,

at



<P>least, that you could not live contentedly, without a friend; and



<P>that you had no friend here, and no possibility of making one -



<P>and, besides, I know you MUST dislike it.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But if you remember rightly, I said, or meant to say, I could not



<P>live contentedly without a friend in the world:&nbsp; I was not so



<P>unreasonable as to require one always near me.&nbsp; I think I could

be



<P>happy in a house full of enemies, if - ' but no; that sentence must



<P>not be continued - I paused, and hastily added, - 'And, besides, we



<P>cannot well leave a place where we have lived for two or three



<P>years, without some feeling of regret.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Will you regret to part with Miss Murray, your sole remaining



<P>pupil and companion?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I dare say I shall in some degree:&nbsp; it was not without sorrow

I



<P>parted with her sister.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I can imagine that.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, Miss Matilda is quite as good - better in one respect.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'What is that?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'She's honest.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And the other is not?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I should not call her DIShonest; but it must be confessed she's a



<P>little artful.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'ARTFUL is she? - I saw she was giddy and vain - and now,' he



<P>added, after a pause, 'I can well believe she was artful too; but



<P>so excessively so as to assume an aspect of extreme simplicity and



<P>unguarded openness.&nbsp; Yes,' continued he, musingly, 'that accounts



<P>for some little things that puzzled me a trifle before.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After that, he turned the conversation to more general subjects.



<P>He did not leave me till we had nearly reached the park-gates:&nbsp;

he



<P>had certainly stepped a little out of his way to accompany me so



<P>far, for he now went back and disappeared down Moss Lane, the



<P>entrance of which we had passed some time before.&nbsp; Assuredly I

did



<P>not regret this circumstance:&nbsp; if sorrow had any place in my heart,



<P>it was that he was gone at last - that he was no longer walking by



<P>my side, and that that short interval of delightful intercourse was



<P>at an end.&nbsp; He had not breathed a word of love, or dropped one

hint



<P>of tenderness or affection, and yet I had been supremely happy.&nbsp;

To



<P>be near him, to hear him talk as he did talk, and to feel that he



<P>thought me worthy to be so spoken to - capable of understanding and



<P>duly appreciating such discourse - was enough.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes, Edward Weston, I could indeed be happy in a house full of



<P>enemies, if I had but one friend, who truly, deeply, and faithfully



<P>loved me; and if that friend were you - though we might be far



<P>apart - seldom to hear from each other, still more seldom to meet -



<P>though toil, and trouble, and vexation might surround me, still -



<P>it would be too much happiness for me to dream of!&nbsp; Yet who can



<P>tell,' said I within myself, as I proceeded up the park, - 'who can



<P>tell what this one month may bring forth?&nbsp; I have lived nearly



<P>three-and-twenty years, and I have suffered much, and tasted little



<P>pleasure yet; is it likely my life all through will be so clouded?



<P>Is it not possible that God may hear my prayers, disperse these



<P>gloomy shadows, and grant me some beams of heaven's sunshine yet?



<P>Will He entirely deny to me those blessings which are so freely



<P>given to others, who neither ask them nor acknowledge them when



<P>received?&nbsp; May I not still hope and trust?&nbsp; I did hope and

trust



<P>for a while:&nbsp; but, alas, alas! the time ebbed away:&nbsp; one week



<P>followed another, and, excepting one distant glimpse and two



<P>transient meetings - during which scarcely anything was said -



<P>while I was walking with Miss Matilda, I saw nothing of him:



<P>except, of course, at church.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And now, the last Sunday was come, and the last service.&nbsp; I was



<P>often on the point of melting into tears during the sermon - the



<P>last I was to hear from him:&nbsp; the best I should hear from anyone,

I



<P>was well assured.&nbsp; It was over - the congregation were departing;



<P>and I must follow.&nbsp; I had then seen him, and heard his voice, too,



<P>probably for the last time.&nbsp; In the churchyard, Matilda was pounced



<P>upon by the two Misses Green.&nbsp; They had many inquiries to make



<P>about her sister, and I know not what besides.&nbsp; I only wished they



<P>would have done, that we might hasten back to Horton Lodge:&nbsp; I



<P>longed to seek the retirement of my own room, or some sequestered



<P>nook in the grounds, that I might deliver myself up to my feelings



<P>- to weep my last farewell, and lament my false hopes and vain



<P>delusions.&nbsp; Only this once, and then adieu to fruitless dreaming

-



<P>thenceforth, only sober, solid, sad reality should occupy my mind.



<P>But while I thus resolved, a low voice close beside me said - 'I



<P>suppose you are going this week, Miss Grey?'&nbsp; 'Yes,' I replied.&nbsp;

I



<P>was very much startled; and had I been at all hysterically



<P>inclined, I certainly should have committed myself in some way



<P>then.&nbsp; Thank God, I was not.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well,' said Mr. Weston, 'I want to bid you good-bye - it is not



<P>likely I shall see you again before you go.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Good-bye, Mr. Weston,' I said.&nbsp; Oh, how I struggled to say it



<P>calmly!&nbsp; I gave him my hand.&nbsp; He retained it a few seconds

in his.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'It is possible we may meet again,' said he; 'will it be of any



<P>consequence to you whether we do or not?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes, I should be very glad to see you again.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I COULD say no less.&nbsp; He kindly pressed my hand, and went.&nbsp;

Now, I



<P>was happy again - though more inclined to burst into tears than



<P>ever.&nbsp; If I had been forced to speak at that moment, a succession



<P>of sobs would have inevitably ensued; and as it was, I could not



<P>keep the water out of my eyes.&nbsp; I walked along with Miss Murray,



<P>turning aside my face, and neglecting to notice several successive



<P>remarks, till she bawled out that I was either deaf or stupid; and



<P>then (having recovered my self-possession), as one awakened from a



<P>fit of abstraction, I suddenly looked up and asked what she had



<P>been saying.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>I LEFT Horton Lodge, and went to join my mother in our new abode at



<P>A-.&nbsp; I found her well in health, resigned in spirit, and even



<P>cheerful, though subdued and sober, in her general demeanour.&nbsp;

We



<P>had only three boarders and half a dozen day-pupils to commence



<P>with; but by due care and diligence we hoped ere long to increase



<P>the number of both.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I set myself with befitting energy to discharge the duties of this



<P>new mode of life.&nbsp; I call it NEW, for there was, indeed, a



<P>considerable difference between working with my mother in a school



<P>of our own, and working as a hireling among strangers, despised and



<P>trampled upon by old and young; and for the first few weeks I was



<P>by no means unhappy.&nbsp; 'It is possible we may meet again,' and 'will



<P>it be of any consequence to you whether we do or not?' - Those



<P>words still rang in my ear and rested on my heart:&nbsp; they were my



<P>secret solace and support.&nbsp; 'I shall see him again. - He will come;



<P>or he will write.'&nbsp; No promise, in fact, was too bright or too



<P>extravagant for Hope to whisper in my ear.&nbsp; I did not believe half



<P>of what she told me:&nbsp; I pretended to laugh at it all; but I was

far



<P>more credulous than I myself supposed; otherwise, why did my heart



<P>leap up when a knock was heard at the front door, and the maid, who



<P>opened it, came to tell my mother a gentleman wished to see her?



<P>and why was I out of humour for the rest of the day, because it



<P>proved to be a music-master come to offer his services to our



<P>school? and what stopped my breath for a moment, when the postman



<P>having brought a couple of letters, my mother said, 'Here, Agnes,



<P>this is for you,' and threw one of them to me? and what made the



<P>hot blood rush into my face when I saw it was directed in a



<P>gentleman's hand? and why - oh! why did that cold, sickening sense



<P>of disappointment fall upon me, when I had torn open the cover and



<P>found it was ONLY a letter from Mary, which, for some reason or



<P>other, her husband had directed for her?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Was it then come to this - that I should be DISAPPOINTED to receive



<P>a letter from my only sister:&nbsp; and because it was not written by

a



<P>comparative stranger?&nbsp; Dear Mary! and she had written it so kindly



<P>- and thinking I should be so pleased to have it! - I was not



<P>worthy to read it!&nbsp; And I believe, in my indignation against



<P>myself, I should have put it aside till I had schooled myself into



<P>a better frame of mind, and was become more deserving of the honour



<P>and privilege of its perusal:&nbsp; but there was my mother looking

on,



<P>and wishful to know what news it contained; so I read it and



<P>delivered it to her, and then went into the schoolroom to attend to



<P>the pupils:&nbsp; but amidst the cares of copies and sums - in the



<P>intervals of correcting errors here, and reproving derelictions of



<P>duty there, I was inwardly taking myself to task with far sterner



<P>severity.&nbsp; 'What a fool you must be,' said my head to my heart,

or



<P>my sterner to my softer self; - 'how could you ever dream that he



<P>would write to you?&nbsp; What grounds have you for such a hope - or



<P>that he will see you, or give himself any trouble about you - or



<P>even think of you again?'&nbsp; 'What grounds?' - and then Hope set



<P>before me that last, short interview, and repeated the words I had



<P>so faithfully treasured in my memory.&nbsp; 'Well, and what was there

in



<P>that? - Who ever hung his hopes upon so frail a twig?&nbsp; What was



<P>there in those words that any common acquaintance might not say to



<P>another?&nbsp; Of course, it was possible you might meet again:&nbsp;

he



<P>might have said so if you had been going to New Zealand; but that



<P>did not imply any INTENTION of seeing you - and then, as to the



<P>question that followed, anyone might ask that:&nbsp; and how did you



<P>answer? - Merely with a stupid, commonplace reply, such as you



<P>would have given to Master Murray, or anyone else you had been on



<P>tolerably civil terms with.'&nbsp; 'But, then,' persisted Hope, 'the



<P>tone and manner in which he spoke.'&nbsp; 'Oh, that is nonsense! he



<P>always speaks impressively; and at that moment there were the



<P>Greens and Miss Matilda Murray just before, and other people



<P>passing by, and he was obliged to stand close beside you, and to



<P>speak very low, unless he wished everybody to hear what he said,



<P>which - though it was nothing at all particular - of course, he



<P>would rather not.'&nbsp; But then, above all, that emphatic, yet gentle



<P>pressure of the hand, which seemed to say, 'TRUST me;' and many



<P>other things besides - too delightful, almost too flattering, to be



<P>repeated even to one's self.&nbsp; 'Egregious folly - too absurd to



<P>require contradiction - mere inventions of the imagination, which



<P>you ought to be ashamed of.&nbsp; If you would but consider your own



<P>unattractive exterior, your unamiable reserve, your foolish



<P>diffidence - which must make you appear cold, dull, awkward, and



<P>perhaps ill-tempered too; - if you had but rightly considered these



<P>from the beginning, you would never have harboured such



<P>presumptuous thoughts:&nbsp; and now that you have been so foolish,

pray



<P>repent and amend, and let us have no more of it!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I cannot say that I implicitly obeyed my own injunctions:&nbsp; but

such



<P>reasoning as this became more and more effective as time wore on,



<P>and nothing was seen or heard of Mr. Weston; until, at last, I gave



<P>up hoping, for even my heart acknowledged it was all in vain.&nbsp;

But



<P>still, I would think of him:&nbsp; I would cherish his image in my mind;



<P>and treasure every word, look, and gesture that my memory could



<P>retain; and brood over his excellences and his peculiarities, and,



<P>in fact, all I had seen, heard, or imagined respecting him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Agnes, this sea air and change of scene do you no good, I think:



<P>I never saw you look so wretched.&nbsp; It must be that you sit too



<P>much, and allow the cares of the schoolroom to worry you.&nbsp; You

must



<P>learn to take things easy, and to be more active and cheerful; you



<P>must take exercise whenever you can get it, and leave the most



<P>tiresome duties to me:&nbsp; they will only serve to exercise my



<P>patience, and, perhaps, try my temper a little.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So said my mother, as we sat at work one morning during the Easter



<P>holidays.&nbsp; I assured her that my employments were not at all



<P>oppressive; that I was well; or, if there was anything amiss, it



<P>would be gone as soon as the trying months of spring were over:



<P>when summer came I should be as strong and hearty as she could wish



<P>to see me:&nbsp; but inwardly her observation startled me.&nbsp; I knew

my



<P>strength was declining, my appetite had failed, and I was grown



<P>listless and desponding; - and if, indeed, he could never care for



<P>me, and I could never see him more - if I was forbidden to minister



<P>to his happiness - forbidden, for ever, to taste the joys of love,



<P>to bless, and to be blessed - then, life must be a burden, and if



<P>my heavenly Father would call me away, I should be glad to rest.



<P>But it would not do to die and leave my mother.&nbsp; Selfish, unworthy



<P>daughter, to forget her for a moment!&nbsp; Was not her happiness



<P>committed in a great measure to my charge? - and the welfare of our



<P>young pupils too?&nbsp; Should I shrink from the work that God had set



<P>before me, because it was not fitted to my taste?&nbsp; Did not He know



<P>best what I should do, and where I ought to labour? - and should I



<P>long to quit His service before I had finished my task, and expect



<P>to enter into His rest without having laboured to earn it?&nbsp; 'No;

by



<P>His help I will arise and address myself diligently to my appointed



<P>duty.&nbsp; If happiness in this world is not for me, I will endeavour



<P>to promote the welfare of those around me, and my reward shall be



<P>hereafter.'&nbsp; So said I in my heart; and from that hour I only



<P>permitted my thoughts to wander to Edward Weston - or at least to



<P>dwell upon him now and then - as a treat for rare occasions:&nbsp; and,



<P>whether it was really the approach of summer or the effect of these



<P>good resolutions, or the lapse of time, or all together,



<P>tranquillity of mind was soon restored; and bodily health and



<P>vigour began likewise, slowly, but surely, to return.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Early in June, I received a letter from Lady Ashby, late Miss



<P>Murray.&nbsp; She had written to me twice or thrice before, from the



<P>different stages of her bridal tour, always in good spirits, and



<P>professing to be very happy.&nbsp; I wondered every time that she had



<P>not forgotten me, in the midst of so much gaiety and variety of



<P>scene.&nbsp; At length, however, there was a pause; and it seemed she



<P>had forgotten me, for upwards of seven months passed away and no



<P>letter.&nbsp; Of course, I did not break my heart about THAT, though

I



<P>often wondered how she was getting on; and when this last epistle



<P>so unexpectedly arrived, I was glad enough to receive it.&nbsp; It was



<P>dated from Ashby Park, where she was come to settle down at last,



<P>having previously divided her time between the continent and the



<P>metropolis.&nbsp; She made many apologies for having neglected me so



<P>long, assured me she had not forgotten me, and had often intended



<P>to write, &amp;c. &amp;c., but had always been prevented by something.&nbsp;

She



<P>acknowledged that she had been leading a very dissipated life, and



<P>I should think her very wicked and very thoughtless; but,



<P>notwithstanding that, she thought a great deal, and, among other



<P>things, that she should vastly like to see me.&nbsp; 'We have been



<P>several days here already,' wrote she.&nbsp; 'We have not a single



<P>friend with us, and are likely to be very dull.&nbsp; You know I never



<P>had a fancy for living with my husband like two turtles in a nest,



<P>were he the most delightful creature that ever wore a coat; so do



<P>take pity upon me and come.&nbsp; I suppose your Midsummer holidays



<P>commence in June, the same as other people's; therefore you cannot



<P>plead want of time; and you must and shall come - in fact, I shall



<P>die if you don't.&nbsp; I want you to visit me as a friend, and stay

a



<P>long time.&nbsp; There is nobody with me, as I told you before, but

Sir



<P>Thomas and old Lady Ashby:&nbsp; but you needn't mind them - they'll



<P>trouble us but little with their company.&nbsp; And you shall have a



<P>room to yourself, whenever you like to retire to it, and plenty of



<P>books to read when my company is not sufficiently amusing.&nbsp; I



<P>forget whether you like babies; if you do, you may have the



<P>pleasure of seeing mine - the most charming child in the world, no



<P>doubt; and all the more so, that I am not troubled with nursing it



<P>- I was determined I wouldn't be bothered with that.



<P>Unfortunately, it is a girl, and Sir Thomas has never forgiven me:



<P>but, however, if you will only come, I promise you shall be its



<P>governess as soon as it can speak; and you shall bring it up in the



<P>way it should go, and make a better woman of it than its mamma.



<P>And you shall see my poodle, too:&nbsp; a splendid little charmer



<P>imported from Paris:&nbsp; and two fine Italian paintings of great value



<P>- I forget the artist.&nbsp; Doubtless you will be able to discover



<P>prodigious beauties in them, which you must point out to me, as I



<P>only admire by hearsay; and many elegant curiosities besides, which



<P>I purchased at Rome and elsewhere; and, finally, you shall see my



<P>new home - the splendid house and grounds I used to covet so



<P>greatly.&nbsp; Alas! how far the promise of anticipation exceeds the



<P>pleasure of possession!&nbsp; There's a fine sentiment!&nbsp; I assure

you I



<P>am become quite a grave old matron:&nbsp; pray come, if it be only to



<P>witness the wonderful change.&nbsp; Write by return of post, and tell

me



<P>when your vacation commences, and say that you will come the day



<P>after, and stay till the day before it closes - in mercy to

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yours affectionately,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'ROSALIE ASHBY.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I showed this strange epistle to my mother, and consulted her on



<P>what I ought to do.&nbsp; She advised me to go; and I went - willing



<P>enough to see Lady Ashby, and her baby, too, and to do anything I



<P>could to benefit her, by consolation or advice; for I imagined she



<P>must be unhappy, or she would not have applied to me thus - but



<P>feeling, as may readily be conceived, that, in accepting the



<P>invitation, I made a great sacrifice for her, and did violence to



<P>my feelings in many ways, instead of being delighted with the



<P>honourable distinction of being entreated by the baronet's lady to



<P>visit her as a friend.&nbsp; However, I determined my visit should be



<P>only for a few days at most; and I will not deny that I derived



<P>some consolation from the idea that, as Ashby Park was not very far



<P>from Horton, I might possibly see Mr. Weston, or, at least, hear



<P>something about him.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>CHAPTER IX - THE BALL</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>'NOW, Miss Grey,' exclaimed Miss Murray, immediately I entered the



<P>schoolroom, after having taken off my outdoor garments, upon



<P>returning from my four weeks' recreation, 'Now - shut the door, and



<P>sit down, and I'll tell you all about the ball.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No - damn it, no!' shouted Miss Matilda.&nbsp; 'Hold your tongue, can't



<P>ye? and let me tell her about my new mare - SUCH a splendour, Miss



<P>Grey! a fine blood mare - '

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Do be quiet, Matilda; and let me tell my news first.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No, no, Rosalie; you'll be such a damned long time over it - she



<P>shall hear me first - I'll be hanged if she doesn't!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I'm sorry to hear, Miss Matilda, that you've not got rid of that



<P>shocking habit yet.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, I can't help it:&nbsp; but I'll never say a wicked word again,

if



<P>you'll only listen to me, and tell Rosalie to hold her confounded



<P>tongue.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Rosalie remonstrated, and I thought I should have been torn in



<P>pieces between them; but Miss Matilda having the loudest voice, her



<P>sister at length gave in, and suffered her to tell her story first:



<P>so I was doomed to hear a long account of her splendid mare, its



<P>breeding and pedigree, its paces, its action, its spirit, &amp;c., and



<P>of her own amazing skill and courage in riding it; concluding with



<P>an assertion that she could clear a five-barred gate 'like



<P>winking,' that papa said she might hunt the next time the hounds



<P>met, and mamma had ordered a bright scarlet hunting-habit for her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, Matilda! what stories you are telling!' exclaimed her sister.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well,' answered she, no whit abashed, 'I know I COULD clear a



<P>five-barred gate, if I tried, and papa WILL say I may hunt, and



<P>mamma WILL order the habit when I ask it.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, now get along,' replied Miss Murray; 'and do, dear Matilda,



<P>try to be a little more lady-like.&nbsp; Miss Grey, I wish you would



<P>tell her not to use such shocking words; she will call her horse a



<P>mare:&nbsp; it is so inconceivably shocking! and then she uses such



<P>dreadful expressions in describing it:&nbsp; she must have learned it



<P>from the grooms.&nbsp; It nearly puts me into fits when she begins.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I learned it from papa, you ass! and his jolly friends,' said the



<P>young lady, vigorously cracking a hunting-whip, which she



<P>habitually carried in her hand.&nbsp; 'I'm as good judge of horseflesh



<P>as the best of 'm.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, now get along, you shocking girl!&nbsp; I really shall take a

fit



<P>if you go on in such a way.&nbsp; And now, Miss Grey, attend to me;

I'm



<P>going to tell you about the ball.&nbsp; You must be dying to hear about



<P>it, I know.&nbsp; Oh, SUCH a ball!&nbsp; You never saw or heard, or

read, or



<P>dreamt of anything like it in all your life.&nbsp; The decorations,

the



<P>entertainment, the supper, the music were indescribable! and then



<P>the guests!&nbsp; There were two noblemen, three baronets, and five



<P>titled ladies, and other ladies and gentlemen innumerable.&nbsp; The



<P>ladies, of course, were of no consequence to me, except to put me



<P>in a good humour with myself, by showing how ugly and awkward most



<P>of them were; and the best, mamma told me, - the most transcendent



<P>beauties among them, were nothing to me.&nbsp; As for me, Miss Grey

-



<P>I'm so SORRY you didn't see me!&nbsp; I was CHARMING - wasn't I,



<P>Matilda?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Middling.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No, but I really was - at least so mamma said - and Brown and



<P>Williamson.&nbsp; Brown said she was sure no gentleman could set eyes

on



<P>me without falling in love that minute; and so I may be allowed to



<P>be a little vain.&nbsp; I know you think me a shocking, conceited,



<P>frivolous girl; but then, you know, I don't attribute it ALL to my



<P>personal attractions:&nbsp; I give some praise to the hairdresser, and



<P>some to my exquisitely lovely dress - you must see it to-morrow -



<P>white gauze over pink satin - and so SWEETLY made! and a necklace



<P>and bracelet of beautiful, large pearls!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I have no doubt you looked very charming:&nbsp; but should that delight



<P>you so very much?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, no! - not that alone:&nbsp; but, then, I was so much admired; and

I



<P>made so MANY conquests in that one night - you'd be astonished to



<P>hear - '

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But what good will they do you?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'What good!&nbsp; Think of any woman asking that!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, I should think one conquest would be enough; and too much,



<P>unless the subjugation were mutual.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, but you know I never agree with you on those points.&nbsp; Now,



<P>wait a bit, and I'll tell you my principal admirers - those who



<P>made themselves very conspicuous that night and after:&nbsp; for I've



<P>been to two parties since.&nbsp; Unfortunately the two noblemen, Lord

G-



<P>and Lord F-, were married, or I might have condescended to be



<P>particularly gracious to THEM; as it was, I did not:&nbsp; though Lord



<P>F-, who hates his wife, was evidently much struck with me.&nbsp; He



<P>asked me to dance with him twice - he is a charming dancer, by-the-



<P>by, and so am I:&nbsp; you can't think how well I did - I was astonished



<P>at myself.&nbsp; My lord was very complimentary too - rather too much

so



<P>in fact - and I thought proper to be a little haughty and



<P>repellent; but I had the pleasure of seeing his nasty, cross wife



<P>ready to perish with spite and vexation - '

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, Miss Murray! you don't mean to say that such a thing could



<P>really give you pleasure?&nbsp; However cross or - '

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, I know it's very wrong; - but never mind!&nbsp; I mean to be

good



<P>some time - only don't preach now, there's a good creature.&nbsp; I



<P>haven't told you half yet.&nbsp; Let me see.&nbsp; Oh! I was going to

tell



<P>you how many unmistakeable admirers I had:- Sir Thomas Ashby was



<P>one, - Sir Hugh Meltham and Sir Broadley Wilson are old codgers,



<P>only fit companions for papa and mamma.&nbsp; Sir Thomas is young, rich,



<P>and gay; but an ugly beast, nevertheless:&nbsp; however, mamma says

I



<P>should not mind that after a few months' acquaintance.&nbsp; Then, there



<P>was Henry Meltham, Sir Hugh's younger son; rather good-looking, and



<P>a pleasant fellow to flirt with:&nbsp; but BEING a younger son, that

is



<P>all he is good for; then there was young Mr. Green, rich enough,



<P>but of no family, and a great stupid fellow, a mere country booby!



<P>and then, our good rector, Mr. Hatfield:&nbsp; an HUMBLE admirer he



<P>ought to consider himself; but I fear he has forgotten to number



<P>humility among his stock of Christian virtues.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Was Mr. Hatfield at the ball?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes, to he sure.&nbsp; Did you think he was too good to go?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I thought be might consider it unclerical.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'By no means.&nbsp; He did not profane his cloth by dancing; but it

was



<P>with difficulty he could refrain, poor man:&nbsp; he looked as if he



<P>were dying to ask my hand just for ONE set; and - oh! by-the-by -



<P>he's got a new curate:&nbsp; that seedy old fellow Mr. Bligh has got

his



<P>long-wished-for living at last, and is gone.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And what is the new one like?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, SUCH a beast!&nbsp; Weston his name is.&nbsp; I can give you his



<P>description in three words - an insensate, ugly, stupid blockhead.



<P>That's four, but no matter - enough of HIM now.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then she returned to the ball, and gave me a further account of her



<P>deportment there, and at the several parties she had since



<P>attended; and further particulars respecting Sir Thomas Ashby and



<P>Messrs. Meltham, Green, and Hatfield, and the ineffaceable



<P>impression she had wrought upon each of them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, which of the four do you like best?' said I, suppressing my



<P>third or fourth yawn.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I detest them all!' replied she, shaking her bright ringlets in



<P>vivacious scorn.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'That means, I suppose, "I like them all" - but which most?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No, I really detest them all; but Harry Meltham is the handsomest



<P>and most amusing, and Mr. Hatfield the cleverest, Sir Thomas the



<P>wickedest, and Mr. Green the most stupid.&nbsp; But the one I'm to have,



<P>I suppose, if I'm doomed to have any of them, is Sir Thomas Ashby.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Surely not, if he's so wicked, and if you dislike him?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, I don't mind his being wicked:&nbsp; he's all the better for that;



<P>and as for disliking him - I shouldn't greatly object to being Lady



<P>Ashby of Ashby Park, if I must marry.&nbsp; But if I could be always



<P>young, I would be always single.&nbsp; I should like to enjoy myself



<P>thoroughly, and coquet with all the world, till I am on the verge



<P>of being called an old maid; and then, to escape the infamy of



<P>that, after having made ten thousand conquests, to break all their



<P>hearts save one, by marrying some high-born, rich, indulgent



<P>husband, whom, on the other hand, fifty ladies were dying to have.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, as long as you entertain these views, keep single by all



<P>means, and never marry at all:&nbsp; not even to escape the infamy of



<P>old-maidenhood.'

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>CHAPTER XXIII - THE PARK</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>I CAME down a little before eight, next morning, as I knew by the



<P>striking of a distant clock.&nbsp; There was no appearance of breakfast.



<P>I waited above an hour before it came, still vainly longing for



<P>access to the library; and, after that lonely repast was concluded,



<P>I waited again about an hour and a half in great suspense and



<P>discomfort, uncertain what to do.&nbsp; At length Lady Ashby came to

bid



<P>me good-morning.&nbsp; She informed me she had only just breakfasted,



<P>and now wanted me to take an early walk with her in the park.&nbsp;

She



<P>asked how long I had been up, and on receiving my answer, expressed



<P>the deepest regret, and again promised to show me the library.&nbsp;

I



<P>suggested she had better do so at once, and then there would be no



<P>further trouble either with remembering or forgetting.&nbsp; She



<P>complied, on condition that I would not think of reading, or



<P>bothering with the books now; for she wanted to show me the



<P>gardens, and take a walk in the park with me, before it became too



<P>hot for enjoyment; which, indeed, was nearly the case already.&nbsp;

Of



<P>course I readily assented; and we took our walk accordingly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As we were strolling in the park, talking of what my companion had



<P>seen and heard during her travelling experience, a gentleman on



<P>horseback rode up and passed us.&nbsp; As he turned, in passing, and



<P>stared me full in the face, I had a good opportunity of seeing what



<P>he was like.&nbsp; He was tall, thin, and wasted, with a slight stoop

in



<P>the shoulders, a pale face, but somewhat blotchy, and disagreeably



<P>red about the eyelids, plain features, and a general appearance of



<P>languor and flatness, relieved by a sinister expression in the



<P>mouth and the dull, soulless eyes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I detest that man!' whispered Lady Ashby, with bitter emphasis, as



<P>he slowly trotted by.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Who is it?' I asked, unwilling to suppose that she should so speak



<P>of her husband.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Sir Thomas Ashby,' she replied, with dreary composure.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And do you DETEST him, Miss Murray?' said I, for I was too much



<P>shocked to remember her name at the moment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes, I do, Miss Grey, and despise him too; and if you knew him you



<P>would not blame me.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But you knew what he was before you married him.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No; I only thought so:&nbsp; I did not half know him really.&nbsp;

I know



<P>you warned me against it, and I wish I had listened to you:&nbsp; but



<P>it's too late to regret that now.&nbsp; And besides, mamma ought to

have



<P>known better than either of us, and she never said anything against



<P>it - quite the contrary.&nbsp; And then I thought he adored me, and



<P>would let me have my own way:&nbsp; he did pretend to do so at first,



<P>but now he does not care a bit about me.&nbsp; Yet I should not care

for



<P>that:&nbsp; he might do as he pleased, if I might only be free to amuse



<P>myself and to stay in London, or have a few friends down here:&nbsp;

but



<P>HE WILL do as he pleases, and I must be a prisoner and a slave.



<P>The moment he saw I could enjoy myself without him, and that others



<P>knew my value better than himself, the selfish wretch began to



<P>accuse me of coquetry and extravagance; and to abuse Harry Meltham,



<P>whose shoes he was not worthy to clean.&nbsp; And then he must needs



<P>have me down in the country, to lead the life of a nun, lest I



<P>should dishonour him or bring him to ruin; as if he had not been



<P>ten times worse every way, with his betting-book, and his gaming-



<P>table, and his opera-girls, and his Lady This and Mrs. That - yes,



<P>and his bottles of wine, and glasses of brandy-and-water too!&nbsp;

Oh,



<P>I would give ten thousand worlds to be Mss Murray again!&nbsp; It is

TOO



<P>bad to feel life, health, and beauty wasting away, unfelt and



<P>unenjoyed, for such a brute as that!' exclaimed she, fairly



<P>bursting into tears in the bitterness of her vexation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Of course, I pitied her exceedingly; as well for her false idea of



<P>happiness and disregard of duty, as for the wretched partner with



<P>whom her fate was linked.&nbsp; I said what I could to comfort her,

and



<P>offered such counsels as I thought she most required:&nbsp; advising



<P>her, first, by gentle reasoning, by kindness, example, and



<P>persuasion, to try to ameliorate her husband; and then, when she



<P>had done all she could, if she still found him incorrigible, to



<P>endeavour to abstract herself from him - to wrap herself up in her



<P>own integrity, and trouble herself as little about him as possible.



<P>I exhorted her to seek consolation in doing her duty to God and



<P>man, to put her trust in Heaven, and solace herself with the care



<P>and nurture of her little daughter; assuring her she would be amply



<P>rewarded by witnessing its progress in strength and wisdom, and



<P>receiving its genuine affection.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But I can't devote myself entirely to a child,' said she; 'it may



<P>die - which is not at all improbable.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But, with care, many a delicate infant has become a strong man or



<P>woman.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But it may grow so intolerably like its father that I shall hate



<P>it.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'That is not likely; it is a little girl, and strongly resembles



<P>its mother.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No matter; I should like it better if it were a boy - only that



<P>its father will leave it no inheritance that he can possibly



<P>squander away.&nbsp; What pleasure can I have in seeing a girl grow

up



<P>to eclipse me, and enjoy those pleasures that I am for ever



<P>debarred from?&nbsp; But supposing I could be so generous as to take



<P>delight in this, still it is ONLY a child; and I can't centre all



<P>my hopes in a child:&nbsp; that is only one degree better than devoting



<P>oneself to a dog.&nbsp; And as for all the wisdom and goodness you have



<P>been trying to instil into me - that is all very right and proper,



<P>I daresay, and if I were some twenty years older, I might fructify



<P>by it:&nbsp; but people must enjoy themselves when they are young; and



<P>if others won't let them - why, they must hate them for it!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'The best way to enjoy yourself is to do what is right and hate



<P>nobody.&nbsp; The end of Religion is not to teach us how to die, but

how



<P>to live; and the earlier you become wise and good, the more of



<P>happiness you secure.&nbsp; And now, Lady Ashby, I have one more piece



<P>of advice to offer you, which is, that you will not make an enemy



<P>of your mother-in-law.&nbsp; Don't get into the way of holding her at



<P>arms' length, and regarding her with jealous distrust.&nbsp; I never

saw



<P>her, but I have heard good as well as evil respecting her; and I



<P>imagine that, though cold and haughty in her general demeanour, and



<P>even exacting in her requirements, she has strong affections for



<P>those who can reach them; and, though so blindly attached to her



<P>son, she is not without good principles, or incapable of hearing



<P>reason.&nbsp; If you would but conciliate her a little, and adopt a



<P>friendly, open manner - and even confide your grievances to her -



<P>real grievances, such as you have a right to complain of - it is my



<P>firm belief that she would, in time, become your faithful friend,



<P>and a comfort and support to you, instead of the incubus you



<P>describe her.'&nbsp; But I fear my advice had little effect upon the



<P>unfortunate young lady; and, finding I could render myself so



<P>little serviceable, my residence at Ashby Park became doubly



<P>painful.&nbsp; But still, I must stay out that day and the following



<P>one, as I had promised to do so:&nbsp; though, resisting all entreaties



<P>and inducements to prolong my visit further, I insisted upon



<P>departing the next morning; affirming that my mother would be



<P>lonely without me, and that she impatiently expected my return.



<P>Nevertheless, it was with a heavy heart that I bade adieu to poor



<P>Lady Ashby, and left her in her princely home.&nbsp; It was no slight



<P>additional proof of her unhappiness, that she should so cling to



<P>the consolation of my presence, and earnestly desire the company of



<P>one whose general tastes and ideas were so little congenial to her



<P>own - whom she had completely forgotten in her hour of prosperity,



<P>and whose presence would be rather a nuisance than a pleasure, if



<P>she could but have half her heart's desire.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>CHAPTER XXII - THE VISIT</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>ASHBY PARK was certainly a very delightful residence.&nbsp; The mansion



<P>was stately without, commodious and elegant within; the park was



<P>spacious and beautiful, chiefly on account of its magnificent old



<P>trees, its stately herds of deer, its broad sheet of water, and the



<P>ancient woods that stretched beyond it:&nbsp; for there was no broken



<P>ground to give variety to the landscape, and but very little of



<P>that undulating swell which adds so greatly to the charm of park



<P>scenery.&nbsp; And so, this was the place Rosalie Murray had so longed



<P>to call her own, that she must have a share of it, on whatever



<P>terms it might be offered - whatever price was to be paid for the



<P>title of mistress, and whoever was to be her partner in the honour



<P>and bliss of such a possession!&nbsp; Well I am not disposed to censure



<P>her now.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She received me very kindly; and, though I was a poor clergyman's



<P>daughter, a governess, and a schoolmistress, she welcomed me with



<P>unaffected pleasure to her home; and - what surprised me rather -



<P>took some pains to make my visit agreeable.&nbsp; I could see, it is



<P>true, that she expected me to be greatly struck with the



<P>magnificence that surrounded her; and, I confess, I was rather



<P>annoyed at her evident efforts to reassure me, and prevent me from



<P>being overwhelmed by so much grandeur - too much awed at the idea



<P>of encountering her husband and mother-in-law, or too much ashamed



<P>of my own humble appearance.&nbsp; I was not ashamed of it at all; for,



<P>though plain, I had taken good care not to shabby or mean, and



<P>should have been pretty considerably at my ease, if my



<P>condescending hostess had not taken such manifest pains to make me



<P>so; and, as for the magnificence that surrounded her, nothing that



<P>met my eyes struck me or affected me half so much as her own



<P>altered appearance.&nbsp; Whether from the influence of fashionable



<P>dissipation, or some other evil, a space of little more than twelve



<P>months had had the effect that might be expected from as many



<P>years, in reducing the plumpness of her form, the freshness of her



<P>complexion, the vivacity of her movements, and the exuberance of



<P>her spirits.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I wished to know if she was unhappy; but I felt it was not my



<P>province to inquire:&nbsp; I might endeavour to win her confidence;

but,



<P>if she chose to conceal her matrimonial cares from me, I would



<P>trouble her with no obtrusive questions.&nbsp; I, therefore, at first,



<P>confined myself to a few general inquiries about her health and



<P>welfare, and a few commendations on the beauty of the park, and of



<P>the little girl that should have been a boy:&nbsp; a small delicate



<P>infant of seven or eight weeks old, whom its mother seemed to



<P>regard with no remarkable degree of interest or affection, though



<P>full as much as I expected her to show.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Shortly after my arrival, she commissioned her maid to conduct me



<P>to my room and see that I had everything I wanted; it was a small,



<P>unpretending, but sufficiently comfortable apartment.&nbsp; When I



<P>descended thence - having divested myself of all travelling



<P>encumbrances, and arranged my toilet with due consideration for the



<P>feelings of my lady hostess, she conducted me herself to the room I



<P>was to occupy when I chose to be alone, or when she was engaged



<P>with visitors, or obliged to be with her mother-in-law, or



<P>otherwise prevented, as she said, from enjoying the pleasure of my



<P>society.&nbsp; It was a quiet, tidy little sitting-room; and I was not



<P>sorry to be provided with such a harbour of refuge.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And some time,' said she, 'I will show you the library:&nbsp; I never



<P>examined its shelves, but, I daresay, it is full of wise books; and



<P>you may go and burrow among them whenever you please.&nbsp; And now

you



<P>shall have some tea - it will soon be dinner-time, but I thought,



<P>as you were accustomed to dine at one, you would perhaps like



<P>better to have a cup of tea about this time, and to dine when we



<P>lunch:&nbsp; and then, you know, you can have your tea in this room,

and



<P>that will save you from having to dine with Lady Ashby and Sir



<P>Thomas:&nbsp; which would be rather awkward - at least, not awkward,

but



<P>rather - a - you know what I mean.&nbsp; I thought you mightn't like

it



<P>so well - especially as we may have other ladies and gentlemen to



<P>dine with us occasionally.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Certainly,' said I, 'I would much rather have it as you say, and,



<P>if you have no objection, I should prefer having all my meals in



<P>this room.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Why so?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Because, I imagine, it would be more agreeable to Lady Ashby and



<P>Sir Thomas.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Nothing of the kind.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'At any rate it would be more agreeable to me.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She made some faint objections, but soon conceded; and I could see



<P>that the proposal was a considerable relief to her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Now, come into the drawing-room,' said she.&nbsp; 'There's the dressing



<P>bell; but I won't go yet:&nbsp; it's no use dressing when there's no

one



<P>to see you; and I want to have a little discourse.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The drawing-room was certainly an imposing apartment, and very



<P>elegantly furnished; but I saw its young mistress glance towards me



<P>as we entered, as if to notice how I was impressed by the



<P>spectacle, and accordingly I determined to preserve an aspect of



<P>stony indifference, as if I saw nothing at all remarkable.&nbsp; But



<P>this was only for a moment:&nbsp; immediately conscience whispered,

'Why



<P>should I disappoint her to save my pride?&nbsp; No - rather let me



<P>sacrifice my pride to give her a little innocent gratification.'



<P>And I honestly looked round, and told her it was a noble room, and



<P>very tastefully furnished.&nbsp; She said little, but I saw she was



<P>pleased.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She showed me her fat French poodle, that lay curled up on a silk



<P>cushion, and the two fine Italian paintings:&nbsp; which, however, she



<P>would not give me time to examine, but, saying I must look at them



<P>some other day, insisted upon my admiring the little jewelled watch



<P>she had purchased in Geneva; and then she took me round the room to



<P>point out sundry articles of VERTU she had brought from Italy:&nbsp;

an



<P>elegant little timepiece, and several busts, small graceful



<P>figures, and vases, all beautifully carved in white marble.&nbsp; She



<P>spoke of these with animation, and heard my admiring comments with



<P>a smile of pleasure:&nbsp; that soon, however, vanished, and was



<P>followed by a melancholy sigh; as if in consideration of the



<P>insufficiency of all such baubles to the happiness of the human



<P>heart, and their woeful inability to supply its insatiate demands.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then, stretching herself upon a couch, she motioned me to a



<P>capacious easy-chair that stood opposite - not before the fire, but



<P>before a wide open window; for it was summer, be it remembered; a



<P>sweet, warm evening in the latter half of June.&nbsp; I sat for a moment



<P>in silence, enjoying the still, pure air, and the delightful



<P>prospect of the park that lay before me, rich in verdure and



<P>foliage, and basking in yellow sunshine, relieved by the long



<P>shadows of declining day.&nbsp; But I must take advantage of this pause:



<P>I had inquiries to make, and, like the substance of a lady's



<P>postscript, the most important must come last.&nbsp; So I began with



<P>asking after Mr. and Mrs. Murray, and Miss Matilda and the young



<P>gentlemen.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I was told that papa had the gout, which made him very ferocious;



<P>and that he would not give up his choice wines, and his substantial



<P>dinners and suppers, and had quarrelled with his physician, because



<P>the latter had dared to say that no medicine could cure him while



<P>he lived so freely; that mamma and the rest were well.&nbsp; Matilda

was



<P>still wild and reckless, but she had got a fashionable governess,



<P>and was considerably improved in her manners, and soon to be



<P>introduced to the world; and John and Charles (now at home for the



<P>holidays) were, by all accounts, 'fine, bold, unruly, mischievous



<P>boys.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And how are the other people getting on?' said I - 'the Greens,



<P>for instance?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Ah! Mr. Green is heart-broken, you know,' replied she, with a



<P>languid smile:&nbsp; 'he hasn't got over his disappointment yet, and



<P>never will, I suppose.&nbsp; He's doomed to be an old bachelor; and

his



<P>sisters are doing their best to get married.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And the Melthams?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, they're jogging on as usual, I suppose:&nbsp; but I know very



<P>little about any of them - except Harry,' said she, blushing



<P>slightly, and smiling again.&nbsp; 'I saw a great deal of him while

we



<P>were in London; for, as soon as he heard we were there, he came up



<P>under pretence of visiting his brother, and either followed me,



<P>like a shadow, wherever I went, or met me, like a reflection, at



<P>every turn.&nbsp; You needn't look so shocked, Miss Grey; I was very



<P>discreet, I assure you, but, you know, one can't help being



<P>admired.&nbsp; Poor fellow!&nbsp; He was not my only worshipper; though

he



<P>was certainly the most conspicuous, and, I think, the most devoted



<P>among them all.&nbsp; And that detestable - ahem - and Sir Thomas chose



<P>to take offence at him - or my profuse expenditure, or something -



<P>I don't exactly know what - and hurried me down to the country at a



<P>moment's notice; where I'm to play the hermit, I suppose, for



<P>life.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And she bit her lip, and frowned vindictively upon the fair domain



<P>she had once so coveted to call her own.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And Mr. Hatfield,' said I, 'what is become of him?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Again she brightened up, and answered gaily - 'Oh! he made up to an



<P>elderly spinster, and married her, not long since; weighing her



<P>heavy purse against her faded charms, and expecting to find that



<P>solace in gold which was denied him in love - ha, ha!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, and I think that's all - except Mr. Weston:&nbsp; what is he



<P>doing?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I don't know, I'm sure.&nbsp; He's gone from Horton.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'How long since? and where is he gone to?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I know nothing about him,' replied she, yawning - 'except that he



<P>went about a month ago - I never asked where' (I would have asked



<P>whether it was to a living or merely another curacy, but thought it



<P>better not); 'and the people made a great rout about his leaving,'



<P>continued she, 'much to Mr. Hatfield's displeasure; for Hatfield



<P>didn't like him, because he had too much influence with the common



<P>people, and because he was not sufficiently tractable and



<P>submissive to him - and for some other unpardonable sins, I don't



<P>know what.&nbsp; But now I positively must go and dress:&nbsp; the second



<P>bell will ring directly, and if I come to dinner in this guise, I



<P>shall never hear the end of it from Lady Ashby.&nbsp; It's a strange



<P>thing one can't be mistress in one's own house!&nbsp; Just ring the



<P>bell, and I'll send for my maid, and tell them to get you some tea.



<P>Only think of that intolerable woman - '

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Who - your maid?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No; - my mother-in-law - and my unfortunate mistake!&nbsp; Instead

of



<P>letting her take herself off to some other house, as she offered to



<P>do when I married, I was fool enough to ask her to live here still,



<P>and direct the affairs of the house for me; because, in the first



<P>place, I hoped we should spend the greater part of the year, in



<P>town, and in the second place, being so young and inexperienced, I



<P>was frightened at the idea of having a houseful of servants to



<P>manage, and dinners to order, and parties to entertain, and all the



<P>rest of it, and I thought she might assist me with her experience;



<P>never dreaming she would prove a usurper, a tyrant, an incubus, a



<P>spy, and everything else that's detestable.&nbsp; I wish she was dead!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She then turned to give her orders to the footman, who had been



<P>standing bolt upright within the door for the last half minute, and



<P>had heard the latter part of her animadversions; and, of course,



<P>made his own reflections upon them, notwithstanding the inflexible,



<P>wooden countenance he thought proper to preserve in the drawing-



<P>room.&nbsp; On my remarking afterwards that he must have heard her,

she



<P>replied - 'Oh, no matter!&nbsp; I never care about the footmen; they're



<P>mere automatons:&nbsp; it's nothing to them what their superiors say

or



<P>do; they won't dare to repeat it; and as to what they think - if



<P>they presume to think at all - of course, nobody cares for that.



<P>It would be a pretty thing indeed, it we were to be tongue-tied by



<P>our servants!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So saying, she ran off to make her hasty toilet, leaving me to



<P>pilot my way back to my sitting-room, where, in due time, I was



<P>served with a cup of tea.&nbsp; After that, I sat musing on Lady Ashby's



<P>past and present condition; and on what little information I had



<P>obtained respecting Mr. Weston, and the small chance there was of



<P>ever seeing or hearing anything more of him throughout my quiet,



<P>drab-colour life:&nbsp; which, henceforth, seemed to offer no



<P>alternative between positive rainy days, and days of dull grey



<P>clouds without downfall.&nbsp; At length, however, I began to weary

of



<P>my thoughts, and to wish I knew where to find the library my



<P>hostess had spoken of; and to wonder whether I was to remain there



<P>doing nothing till bedtime.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As I was not rich enough to possess a watch, I could not tell how



<P>time was passing, except by observing the slowly lengthening



<P>shadows from the window; which presented a side view, including a



<P>corner of the park, a clump of trees whose topmost branches had



<P>been colonized by an innumerable company of noisy rooks, and a high



<P>wall with a massive wooden gate:&nbsp; no doubt communicating with the



<P>stable-yard, as a broad carriage-road swept up to it from the park.



<P>The shadow of this wall soon took posession of the whole of the



<P>ground as far as I could see, forcing the golden sunlight to



<P>retreat inch by inch, and at last take refuge in the very tops of



<P>the trees.&nbsp; Ere long, even they were left in shadow - the shadow

of



<P>the distant hills, or of the earth itself; and, in sympathy for the



<P>busy citizens of the rookery, I regretted to see their habitation,



<P>so lately bathed in glorious light, reduced to the sombre, work-a-



<P>day hue of the lower world, or of my own world within.&nbsp; For a



<P>moment, such birds as soared above the rest might still receive the



<P>lustre on their wings, which imparted to their sable plumage the



<P>hue and brilliance of deep red gold; at last, that too departed.



<P>Twilight came stealing on; the rooks became more quiet; I became



<P>more weary, and wished I were going home to-morrow.&nbsp; At length

it



<P>grew dark; and I was thinking of ringing for a candle, and betaking



<P>myself to bed, when my hostess appeared, with many apologies for



<P>having neglected me so long, and laying all the blame upon that



<P>'nasty old woman,' as she called her mother-in-law.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'If I didn't sit with her in the drawing-room while Sir Thomas is



<P>taking his wine,' said she, 'she would never forgive me; and then,



<P>if I leave the room the instant he comes - as I have done once or



<P>twice - it is an unpardonable offence against her dear Thomas.&nbsp;

SHE



<P>never showed such disrespect to HER husband:&nbsp; and as for affection,



<P>wives never think of that now-a-days, she supposes:&nbsp; but things



<P>were different in HER time - as if there was any good to be done by



<P>staying in the room, when he does nothing but grumble and scold



<P>when he's in a bad humour, talk disgusting nonsense when he's in a



<P>good one, and go to sleep on the sofa when he's too stupid for



<P>either; which is most frequently the case now, when he has nothing



<P>to do but to sot over his wine.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But could you not try to occupy his mind with something better;



<P>and engage him to give up such habits?&nbsp; I'm sure you have powers

of



<P>persuasion, and qualifications for amusing a gentleman, which many



<P>ladies would be glad to possess.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And so you think I would lay myself out for his amusement!&nbsp; No:



<P>that's not MY idea of a wife.&nbsp; It's the husband's part to please



<P>the wife, not hers to please him; and if he isn't satisfied with



<P>her as she is - and thankful to possess her too - he isn't worthy



<P>of her, that's all.&nbsp; And as for persuasion, I assure you I shan't



<P>trouble myself with that:&nbsp; I've enough to do to bear with him as

he



<P>is, without attempting to work a reform.&nbsp; But I'm sorry I left

you



<P>so long alone, Miss Grey.&nbsp; How have you passed the time?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Chiefly in watching the rooks.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Mercy, how dull you must have been!&nbsp; I really must show you the



<P>library; and you must ring for everything you want, just as you



<P>would in an inn, and make yourself comfortable.&nbsp; I have selfish



<P>reasons for wishing to make you happy, because I want you to stay



<P>with me, and not fulfil your horrid threat of running away in a day



<P>or two.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, don't let me keep you out of the drawing-room any longer to-



<P>night, for at present I am tired and wish to go to bed.'

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>MISS MURRAY now always went twice to church, for she so loved



<P>admiration that she could not bear to lose a single opportunity of



<P>obtaining it; and she was so sure of it wherever she showed



<P>herself, that, whether Harry Meltham and Mr. Green were there or



<P>not, there was certain to be somebody present who would not be



<P>insensible to her charms, besides the Rector, whose official



<P>capacity generally obliged him to attend.&nbsp; Usually, also, if the



<P>weather permitted, both she and her sister would walk home;



<P>Matilda, because she hated the confinement of the carriage; she,



<P>because she disliked the privacy of it, and enjoyed the company



<P>that generally enlivened the first mile of the journey in walking



<P>from the church to Mr. Green's park-gates:&nbsp; near which commenced



<P>the private road to Horton Lodge, which lay in the opposite



<P>direction, while the highway conducted in a straightforward course



<P>to the still more distant mansion of Sir Hugh Meltham.&nbsp; Thus there



<P>was always a chance of being accompanied, so far, either by Harry



<P>Meltham, with or without Miss Meltham, or Mr. Green, with perhaps



<P>one or both of his sisters, and any gentlemen visitors they might



<P>have.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Whether I walked with the young ladies or rode with their parents,



<P>depended upon their own capricious will:&nbsp; if they chose to 'take'



<P>me, I went; if, for reasons best known to themselves, they chose to



<P>go alone, I took my seat in the carriage.&nbsp; I liked walking better,



<P>but a sense of reluctance to obtrude my presence on anyone who did



<P>not desire it, always kept me passive on these and similar



<P>occasions; and I never inquired into the causes of their varying



<P>whims.&nbsp; Indeed, this was the best policy - for to submit and oblige



<P>was the governess's part, to consult their own pleasure was that of



<P>the pupils.&nbsp; But when I did walk, the first half of journey was



<P>generally a great nuisance to me.&nbsp; As none of the before-mentioned



<P>ladies and gentlemen ever noticed me, it was disagreeable to walk



<P>beside them, as if listening to what they said, or wishing to be



<P>thought one of them, while they talked over me, or across; and if



<P>their eyes, in speaking, chanced to fall on me, it seemed as if



<P>they looked on vacancy - as if they either did not see me, or were



<P>very desirous to make it appear so.&nbsp; It was disagreeable, too,

to



<P>walk behind, and thus appear to acknowledge my own inferiority;



<P>for, in truth, I considered myself pretty nearly as good as the



<P>best of them, and wished them to know that I did so, and not to



<P>imagine that I looked upon myself as a mere domestic, who knew her



<P>own place too well to walk beside such fine ladies and gentlemen as



<P>they were - though her young ladies might choose to have her with



<P>them, and even condescend to converse with her when no better



<P>company were at hand.&nbsp; Thus - I am almost ashamed to confess it

-



<P>but indeed I gave myself no little trouble in my endeavours (if I



<P>did keep up with them) to appear perfectly unconscious or



<P>regardless of their presence, as if I were wholly absorbed in my



<P>own reflections, or the contemplation of surrounding objects; or,



<P>if I lingered behind, it was some bird or insect, some tree or



<P>flower, that attracted my attention, and having duly examined that,



<P>I would pursue my walk alone, at a leisurely pace, until my pupils



<P>had bidden adieu to their companions and turned off into the quiet



<P>private road.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One such occasion I particularly well remember; it was a lovely



<P>afternoon about the close of March; Mr. Green and his sisters had



<P>sent their carriage back empty, in order to enjoy the bright



<P>sunshine and balmy air in a sociable walk home along with their



<P>visitors, Captain Somebody and Lieutenant Somebody-else (a couple



<P>of military fops), and the Misses Murray, who, of course, contrived



<P>to join them.&nbsp; Such a party was highly agreeable to Rosalie; but



<P>not finding it equally suitable to my taste, I presently fell back,



<P>and began to botanise and entomologise along the green banks and



<P>budding hedges, till the company was considerably in advance of me,



<P>and I could hear the sweet song of the happy lark; then my spirit



<P>of misanthropy began to melt away beneath the soft, pure air and



<P>genial sunshine; but sad thoughts of early childhood, and yearnings



<P>for departed joys, or for a brighter future lot, arose instead.&nbsp;

As



<P>my eyes wandered over the steep banks covered with young grass and



<P>green-leaved plants, and surmounted by budding hedges, I longed



<P>intensely for some familiar flower that might recall the woody



<P>dales or green hill-sides of home:&nbsp; the brown moorlands, of course,



<P>were out of the question.&nbsp; Such a discovery would make my eyes

gush



<P>out with water, no doubt; but that was one of my greatest



<P>enjoyments now.&nbsp; At length I descried, high up between the twisted



<P>roots of an oak, three lovely primroses, peeping so sweetly from



<P>their hiding-place that the tears already started at the sight; but



<P>they grew so high above me, that I tried in vain to gather one or



<P>two, to dream over and to carry with me:&nbsp; I could not reach them



<P>unless I climbed the bank, which I was deterred from doing by



<P>hearing a footstep at that moment behind me, and was, therefore,



<P>about to turn away, when I was startled by the words, 'Allow me to



<P>gather them for you, Miss Grey,' spoken in the grave, low tones of



<P>a well-known voice.&nbsp; Immediately the flowers were gathered, and

in



<P>my hand.&nbsp; It was Mr. Weston, of course - who else would trouble



<P>himself to do so much for ME?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I thanked him; whether warmly or coldly, I cannot tell:&nbsp; but



<P>certain I am that I did not express half the gratitude I felt.&nbsp;

It



<P>was foolish, perhaps, to feel any gratitude at all; but it seemed



<P>to me, at that moment, as if this were a remarkable instance of his



<P>good-nature:&nbsp; an act of kindness, which I could not repay, but



<P>never should forget:&nbsp; so utterly unaccustomed was I to receive

such



<P>civilities, so little prepared to expect them from anyone within



<P>fifty miles of Horton Lodge.&nbsp; Yet this did not prevent me from



<P>feeling a little uncomfortable in his presence; and I proceeded to



<P>follow my pupils at a much quicker pace than before; though,



<P>perhaps, if Mr. Weston had taken the hint, and let me pass without



<P>another word, I might have repeated it an hour after:&nbsp; but he did



<P>not.&nbsp; A somewhat rapid walk for me was but an ordinary pace for



<P>him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Your young ladies have left you alone,' said he.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes, they are occupied with more agreeable company.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Then don't trouble yourself to overtake them.'&nbsp; I slackened my



<P>pace; but next moment regretted having done so:&nbsp; my companion did



<P>not speak; and I had nothing in the world to say, and feared he



<P>might be in the same predicament.&nbsp; At length, however, he broke

the



<P>pause by asking, with a certain quiet abruptness peculiar to



<P>himself, if I liked flowers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes; very much,' I answered, 'wild-flowers especially.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I like wild-flowers,' said he; 'others I don't care about, because



<P>I have no particular associations connected with them - except one



<P>or two.&nbsp; What are your favourite flowers?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Primroses, blue-bells, and heath-blossoms.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Not violets?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No; because, as you say, I have no particular associations



<P>connected with them; for there are no sweet violets among the hills



<P>and valleys round my home.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'It must be a great consolation to you to have a home, Miss Grey,'



<P>observed my companion after a short pause:&nbsp; 'however remote, or



<P>however seldom visited, still it is something to look to.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'It is so much that I think I could not live without it,' replied



<P>I, with an enthusiasm of which I immediately repented; for I



<P>thought it must have sounded essentially silly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, yes, you could,' said he, with a thoughtful smile.&nbsp; 'The ties



<P>that bind us to life are tougher than you imagine, or than anyone



<P>can who has not felt how roughly they may be pulled without



<P>breaking.&nbsp; You might be miserable without a home, but even YOU



<P>could live; and not so miserably as you suppose.&nbsp; The human heart



<P>is like india-rubber; a little swells it, but a great deal will not



<P>burst it.&nbsp; If "little more than nothing will disturb it, little



<P>less than all things will suffice" to break it.&nbsp; As in the outer



<P>members of our frame, there is a vital power inherent in itself



<P>that strengthens it against external violence.&nbsp; Every blow that



<P>shakes it will serve to harden it against a future stroke; as



<P>constant labour thickens the skin of the hand, and strengthens its



<P>muscles instead of wasting them away:&nbsp; so that a day of arduous



<P>toil, that might excoriate a lady's palm, would make no sensible



<P>impression on that of a hardy ploughman.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I speak from experience - partly my own.&nbsp; There was a time when

I



<P>thought as you do - at least, I was fully persuaded that home and



<P>its affections were the only things that made life tolerable:



<P>that, if deprived of these, existence would become a burden hard to



<P>be endured; but now I have no home - unless you would dignify my



<P>two hired rooms at Horton by such a name; - and not twelve months



<P>ago I lost the last and dearest of my early friends; and yet, not



<P>only I live, but I am not wholly destitute of hope and comfort,



<P>even for this life:&nbsp; though I must acknowledge that I can seldom



<P>enter even an humble cottage at the close of day, and see its



<P>inhabitants peaceably gathered around their cheerful hearth,



<P>without a feeling ALMOST of envy at their domestic enjoyment.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'You don't know what happiness lies before you yet,' said I:&nbsp; 'you



<P>are now only in the commencement of your journey.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'The best of happiness,' replied he, 'is mine already - the power



<P>and the will to be useful.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>We now approached a stile communicating with a footpath that



<P>conducted to a farm-house, where, I suppose, Mr. Weston purposed to



<P>make himself 'useful;' for he presently took leave of me, crossed



<P>the stile, and traversed the path with his usual firm, elastic



<P>tread, leaving me to ponder his words as I continued my course



<P>alone.&nbsp; I had heard before that he had lost his mother not many



<P>months before he came.&nbsp; She then was the last and dearest of his



<P>early friends; and he had NO HOME.&nbsp; I pitied him from my heart:&nbsp;

I



<P>almost wept for sympathy.&nbsp; And this, I thought, accounted for the



<P>shade of premature thoughtfulness that so frequently clouded his



<P>brow, and obtained for him the reputation of a morose and sullen



<P>disposition with the charitable Miss Murray and all her kin.



<P>'But,' thought I, 'he is not so miserable as I should be under such



<P>a deprivation:&nbsp; he leads an active life; and a wide field for



<P>useful exertion lies before him.&nbsp; He can MAKE friends; and he can



<P>make a home too, if he pleases; and, doubtless, he will please some



<P>time.&nbsp; God grant the partner of that home may be worthy of his



<P>choice, and make it a happy one - such a home as he deserves to



<P>have!&nbsp; And how delightful it would be to - '&nbsp; But no matter

what I



<P>thought.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I began this book with the intention of concealing nothing; that



<P>those who liked might have the benefit of perusing a fellow-



<P>creature's heart:&nbsp; but we have some thoughts that all the angels

in



<P>heaven are welcome to behold, but not our brother-men - not even



<P>the best and kindest amongst them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>By this time the Greens had taken themselves to their own abode,



<P>and the Murrays had turned down the private road, whither I



<P>hastened to follow them.&nbsp; I found the two girls warm in an animated



<P>discussion on the respective merits of the two young officers; but



<P>on seeing me Rosalie broke off in the middle of a sentence to



<P>exclaim, with malicious glee -

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh-ho, Miss Grey! you're come at last, are you?&nbsp; No WONDER you



<P>lingered so long behind; and no WONDER you always stand up so



<P>vigorously for Mr. Weston when I abuse him.&nbsp; Ah-ha!&nbsp; I see

it all



<P>now!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Now, come, Miss Murray, don't be foolish,' said I, attempting a



<P>good-natured laugh; 'you know such nonsense can make no impression



<P>on me.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But she still went on talking such intolerable stuff - her sister



<P>helping her with appropriate fiction coined for the occasion - that



<P>I thought it necessary to say something in my own justification.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'What folly all this is!' I exclaimed.&nbsp; 'If Mr. Weston's road



<P>happened to be the same as mine for a few yards, and if he chose to



<P>exchange a word or two in passing, what is there so remarkable in



<P>that?&nbsp; I assure you, I never spoke to him before:&nbsp; except

once.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Where? where? and when?' cried they eagerly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'In Nancy's cottage.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Ah-ha! you've met him there, have you?' exclaimed Rosalie, with



<P>exultant laughter.&nbsp; 'Ah! now, Matilda, I've found out why she's

so



<P>fond of going to Nancy Brown's!&nbsp; She goes there to flirt with Mr.



<P>Weston.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Really, that is not worth contradicting - I only saw him there



<P>once, I tell you - and how could I know he was coming?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Irritated as I was at their foolish mirth and vexatious



<P>imputations, the uneasiness did not continue long:&nbsp; when they had



<P>had their laugh out, they returned again to the captain and



<P>lieutenant; and, while they disputed and commented upon them, my



<P>indignation rapidly cooled; the cause of it was quickly forgotten,



<P>and I turned my thoughts into a pleasanter channel.&nbsp; Thus we



<P>proceeded up the park, and entered the hall; and as I ascended the



<P>stairs to my own chamber, I had but one thought within me:&nbsp; my



<P>heart was filled to overflowing with one single earnest wish.



<P>Having entered the room, and shut the door, I fell upon my knees



<P>and offered up a fervent but not impetuous prayer:&nbsp; 'Thy will be



<P>done,' I strove to say throughout; but, 'Father, all things are



<P>possible with Thee, and may it be Thy will,' was sure to follow.



<P>That wish - that prayer - both men and women would have scorned me



<P>for - 'But, Father, THOU wilt NOT despise!' I said, and felt that



<P>it was true.&nbsp; It seemed to me that another's welfare was at least



<P>as ardently implored for as my own; nay, even THAT was the



<P>principal object of my heart's desire.&nbsp; I might have been deceiving



<P>myself; but that idea gave me confidence to ask, and power to hope



<P>I did not ask in vain.&nbsp; As for the primroses, I kept two of them

in



<P>a glass in my room until they were completely withered, and the



<P>housemaid threw them out; and the petals of the other I pressed



<P>between the leaves of my Bible - I have them still, and mean to



<P>keep them always.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>CHAPTER VII - HORTON LODGE</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>THE 31st of January was a wild, tempestuous day:&nbsp; there was a



<P>strong north wind, with a continual storm of snow drifting on the



<P>ground and whirling through the air.&nbsp; My friends would have had

me



<P>delay my departure, but fearful of prejudicing my employers against



<P>me by such want of punctuality at the commencement of my



<P>undertaking, I persisted in keeping the appointment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I will not inflict upon my readers an account of my leaving home on



<P>that dark winter morning:&nbsp; the fond farewells, the long, long



<P>journey to O-, the solitary waitings in inns for coaches or trains



<P>- for there were some railways then - and, finally, the meeting at



<P>O- with Mr. Murray's servant, who had been sent with the phaeton to



<P>drive me from thence to Horton Lodge.&nbsp; I will just state that the



<P>heavy snow had thrown such impediments in the way of both horses



<P>and steam-engines, that it was dark some hours before I reached my



<P>journey's end, and that a most bewildering storm came on at last,



<P>which made the few miles' space between O- and Horton Lodge a long



<P>and formidable passage.&nbsp; I sat resigned, with the cold, sharp snow



<P>drifting through my veil and filling my lap, seeing nothing, and



<P>wondering how the unfortunate horse and driver could make their way



<P>even as well as they did; and indeed it was but a toilsome,



<P>creeping style of progression, to say the best of it.&nbsp; At length

we



<P>paused; and, at the call of the driver, someone unlatched and



<P>rolled back upon their creaking hinges what appeared to be the park



<P>gates.&nbsp; Then we proceeded along a smoother road, whence,



<P>occasionally, I perceived some huge, hoary mass gleaming through



<P>the darkness, which I took to be a portion of a snow-clad tree.



<P>After a considerable time we paused again, before the stately



<P>portico of a large house with long windows descending to the



<P>ground.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I rose with some difficulty from under the superincumbent



<P>snowdrift, and alighted from the carriage, expecting that a kind



<P>and hospitable reception would indemnify me for the toils and



<P>hardships of the day.&nbsp; A gentleman person in black opened the door,



<P>and admitted me into a spacious hall, lighted by an amber-coloured



<P>lamp suspended from the ceiling; he led me through this, along a



<P>passage, and opening the door of a back room, told me that was the



<P>schoolroom.&nbsp; I entered, and found two young ladies and two young



<P>gentlemen - my future pupils, I supposed.&nbsp; After a formal greeting,



<P>the elder girl, who was trifling over a piece of canvas and a



<P>basket of German wools, asked if I should like to go upstairs.&nbsp;

I



<P>replied in the affirmative, of course.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Matilda, take a candle, and show her her room,' said she.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Matilda, a strapping hoyden of about fourteen, with a short



<P>frock and trousers, shrugged her shoulders and made a slight



<P>grimace, but took a candle and proceeded before me up the back



<P>stairs (a long, steep, double flight), and through a long, narrow



<P>passage, to a small but tolerably comfortable room.&nbsp; She then asked



<P>me if I would take some tea or coffee.&nbsp; I was about to answer No;



<P>but remembering that I had taken nothing since seven o'clock that



<P>morning, and feeling faint in consequence, I said I would take a



<P>cup of tea.&nbsp; Saying she would tell 'Brown,' the young lady



<P>departed; and by the time I had divested myself of my heavy, wet



<P>cloak, shawl, bonnet, &amp;c., a mincing damsel came to say the young



<P>ladies desired to know whether I would take my tea up there or in



<P>the schoolroom.&nbsp; Under the plea of fatigue I chose to take it



<P>there.&nbsp; She withdrew; and, after a while, returned again with a



<P>small tea-tray, and placed it on the chest of drawers, which served



<P>as a dressing-table.&nbsp; Having civilly thanked her, I asked at what



<P>time I should be expected to rise in the morning.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'The young ladies and gentlemen breakfast at half-past eight,



<P>ma'am,' said she; 'they rise early; but, as they seldom do any



<P>lessons before breakfast, I should think it will do if you rise



<P>soon after seven.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I desired her to be so kind as to call me at seven, and, promising



<P>to do so, she withdrew.&nbsp; Then, having broken my long fast on a

cup



<P>of tea and a little thin bread and butter, I sat down beside the



<P>small, smouldering fire, and amused myself with a hearty fit of



<P>crying; after which, I said my prayers, and then, feeling



<P>considerably relieved, began to prepare for bed.&nbsp; Finding that

none



<P>of my luggage was brought up, I instituted a search for the bell;



<P>and failing to discover any signs of such a convenience in any



<P>corner of the room, I took my candle and ventured through the long



<P>passage, and down the steep stairs, on a voyage of discovery.



<P>Meeting a well-dressed female on the way, I told her what I wanted;



<P>but not without considerable hesitation, as I was not quite sure



<P>whether it was one of the upper servants, or Mrs. Murray herself:



<P>it happened, however, to be the lady's-maid.&nbsp; With the air of one



<P>conferring an unusual favour, she vouchsafed to undertake the



<P>sending up of my things; and when I had re-entered my room, and



<P>waited and wondered a long time (greatly fearing that she had



<P>forgotten or neglected to perform her promise, and doubting whether



<P>to keep waiting or go to bed, or go down again), my hopes, at



<P>length, were revived by the sound of voices and laughter,



<P>accompanied by the tramp of feet along the passage; and presently



<P>the luggage was brought in by a rough-looking maid and a man,



<P>neither of them very respectful in their demeanour to me.&nbsp; Having



<P>shut the door upon their retiring footsteps, and unpacked a few of



<P>my things, I betook myself to rest; gladly enough, for I was weary



<P>in body and mind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was with a strange feeling of desolation, mingled with a strong



<P>sense of the novelty of my situation, and a joyless kind of



<P>curiosity concerning what was yet unknown, that I awoke the next



<P>morning; feeling like one whirled away by enchantment, and suddenly



<P>dropped from the clouds into a remote and unknown land, widely and



<P>completely isolated from all he had ever seen or known before; or



<P>like a thistle-seed borne on the wind to some strange nook of



<P>uncongenial soil, where it must lie long enough before it can take



<P>root and germinate, extracting nourishment from what appears so



<P>alien to its nature:&nbsp; if, indeed, it ever can.&nbsp; But this gives

no



<P>proper idea of my feelings at all; and no one that has not lived



<P>such a retired, stationary life as mine, can possibly imagine what



<P>they were:&nbsp; hardly even if he has known what it is to awake some



<P>morning, and find himself in Port Nelson, in New Zealand, with a



<P>world of waters between himself and all that knew him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I shall not soon forget the peculiar feeling with which I raised my



<P>blind and looked out upon the unknown world:&nbsp; a wide, white



<P>wilderness was all that met my gaze; a waste of

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Deserts tossed in snow,



<P>And heavy laden groves.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I descended to the schoolroom with no remarkable eagerness to join



<P>my pupils, though not without some feeling of curiosity respecting



<P>what a further acquaintance would reveal.&nbsp; One thing, among others



<P>of more obvious importance, I determined with myself - I must begin



<P>with calling them Miss and Master.&nbsp; It seemed to me a chilling

and



<P>unnatural piece of punctilio between the children of a family and



<P>their instructor and daily companion; especially where the former



<P>were in their early childhood, as at Wellwood House; but even



<P>there, my calling the little Bloomfields by their simple names had



<P>been regarded as an offensive liberty:&nbsp; as their parents had taken



<P>care to show me, by carefully designating them MASTER and MISS



<P>Bloomfield, &amp;c., in speaking to me.&nbsp; I had been very slow to

take



<P>the hint, because the whole affair struck me as so very absurd; but



<P>now I determined to be wiser, and begin at once with as much form



<P>and ceremony as any member of the family would be likely to



<P>require:&nbsp; and, indeed, the children being so much older, there



<P>would be less difficulty; though the little words Miss and Master



<P>seemed to have a surprising effect in repressing all familiar,



<P>open-hearted kindness, and extinguishing every gleam of cordiality



<P>that might arise between us.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As I cannot, like Dogberry, find it in my heart to bestow all my



<P>tediousness upon the reader, I will not go on to bore him with a



<P>minute detail of all the discoveries and proceedings of this and



<P>the following day.&nbsp; No doubt he will be amply satisfied with a



<P>slight sketch of the different members of the family, and a general



<P>view of the first year or two of my sojourn among them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To begin with the head:&nbsp; Mr. Murray was, by all accounts, a



<P>blustering, roystering, country squire:&nbsp; a devoted fox-hunter,

a



<P>skilful horse-jockey and farrier, an active, practical farmer, and



<P>a hearty BON VIVANT.&nbsp; By all accounts, I say; for, except on



<P>Sundays, when he went to church, I never saw him from month to



<P>month:&nbsp; unless, in crossing the hall or walking in the grounds,

the



<P>figure of a tall, stout gentleman, with scarlet cheeks and crimson



<P>nose, happened to come across me; on which occasions, if he passed



<P>near enough to speak, an unceremonious nod, accompanied by a



<P>'Morning, Miss Grey,' or some such brief salutation, was usually



<P>vouchsafed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Frequently, indeed, his loud laugh reached me

from



<P>afar; and oftener still I heard him swearing and blaspheming



<P>against the footmen, groom, coachman, or some other hapless



<P>dependant.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Murray was a handsome, dashing lady of forty, who certainly



<P>required neither rouge nor padding to add to her charms; and whose



<P>chief enjoyments were, or seemed to be, in giving or frequenting



<P>parties, and in dressing at the very top of the fashion.&nbsp; I did

not



<P>see her till eleven o'clock on the morning after my arrival; when



<P>she honoured me with a visit, just as my mother might step into the



<P>kitchen to see a new servant-girl:&nbsp; yet not so, either, for my



<P>mother would have seen her immediately after her arrival, and not



<P>waited till the next day; and, moreover, she would have addressed



<P>her in a more kind and friendly manner, and given her some words of



<P>comfort as well as a plain exposition of her duties; but Mrs.



<P>Murray did neither the one nor the other.&nbsp; She just stepped into



<P>the schoolroom on her return from ordering dinner in the



<P>housekeeper's room, bade me good-morning, stood for two minutes by



<P>the fire, said a few words about the weather and the 'rather rough'



<P>journey I must have had yesterday; petted her youngest child - a



<P>boy of ten - who had just been wiping his mouth and hands on her



<P>gown, after indulging in some savoury morsel from the house-



<P>keeper's store; told me what a sweet, good boy he was; and then



<P>sailed out, with a self-complacent smile upon her face:&nbsp; thinking,



<P>no doubt, that she had done quite enough for the present, and had



<P>been delightfully condescending into the bargain.&nbsp; Her children



<P>evidently held the same opinion, and I alone thought otherwise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After this she looked in upon me once or twice, during the absence



<P>of my pupils, to enlighten me concerning my duties towards them.



<P>For the girls she seemed anxious only to render them as



<P>superficially attractive and showily accomplished as they could



<P>possibly be made, without present trouble or discomfort to



<P>themselves; and I was to act accordingly - to study and strive to



<P>amuse and oblige, instruct, refine, and polish, with the least



<P>possible exertion on their part, and no exercise of authority on



<P>mine.&nbsp; With regard to the two boys, it was much the same; only



<P>instead of accomplishments, I was to get the greatest possible



<P>quantity of Latin grammar and Valpy's Delectus into their heads, in



<P>order to fit them for school - the greatest possible quantity at



<P>least WITHOUT trouble to themselves.&nbsp; John might be a 'little high-



<P>spirited,' and Charles might be a little 'nervous and tedious - '

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But at all events, Miss Grey,' said she, 'I hope YOU will keep



<P>your temper, and be mild and patient throughout; especially with



<P>the dear little Charles; he is so extremely nervous and



<P>susceptible, and so utterly unaccustomed to anything but the



<P>tenderest treatment.&nbsp; You will excuse my naming these things to



<P>you; for the fact is, I have hitherto found all the governesses,



<P>even the very best of them, faulty in this particular.&nbsp; They wanted



<P>that meek and quiet spirit, which St. Matthew, or some of them,



<P>says is better than the putting on of apparel - you will know the



<P>passage to which I allude, for you are a clergyman's daughter.&nbsp;

But



<P>I have no doubt you will give satisfaction in this respect as well



<P>as the rest.&nbsp; And remember, on all occasions, when any of the young



<P>people do anything improper, if persuasion and gentle remonstrance



<P>will not do, let one of the others come and tell me; for I can



<P>speak to them more plainly than it would be proper for you to do.



<P>And make them as happy as you can, Miss Grey, and I dare say you



<P>will do very well.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I observed that while Mrs. Murray was so extremely solicitous for



<P>the comfort and happiness of her children, and continually talking



<P>about it, she never once mentioned mine; though they were at home,



<P>surrounded by friends, and I an alien among strangers; and I did



<P>not yet know enough of the world, not to be considerably surprised



<P>at this anomaly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Murray, otherwise Rosalie, was about sixteen when I came, and



<P>decidedly a very pretty girl; and in two years longer, as time more



<P>completely developed her form and added grace to her carriage and



<P>deportment, she became positively beautiful; and that in no common



<P>degree.&nbsp; She was tall and slender, yet not thin; perfectly formed,



<P>exquisitely fair, though not without a brilliant, healthy bloom;



<P>her hair, which she wore in a profusion of long ringlets, was of a



<P>very light brown inclining to yellow; her eyes were pale blue, but



<P>so clear and bright that few would wish them darker; the rest of



<P>her features were small, not quite regular, and not remarkably



<P>otherwise:&nbsp; but altogether you could not hesitate to pronounce

her



<P>a very lovely girl.&nbsp; I wish I could say as much for mind and



<P>disposition as I can for her form and face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Yet think not I have any dreadful disclosures to make:&nbsp; she was



<P>lively, light-hearted, and could be very agreeable, with those who



<P>did not cross her will.&nbsp; Towards me, when I first came, she was



<P>cold and haughty, then insolent and overbearing; but, on a further



<P>acquaintance, she gradually laid aside her airs, and in time became



<P>as deeply attached to me as it was possible for HER to be to one of



<P>my character and position:&nbsp; for she seldom lost sight, for above



<P>half an hour at a time, of the fact of my being a hireling and a



<P>poor curate's daughter.&nbsp; And yet, upon the whole, I believe she



<P>respected me more than she herself was aware of; because I was the



<P>only person in the house who steadily professed good principles,



<P>habitually spoke the truth, and generally endeavoured to make



<P>inclination bow to duty; and this I say, not, of course, in



<P>commendation of myself, but to show the unfortunate state of the



<P>family to which my services were, for the present, devoted.&nbsp; There



<P>was no member of it in whom I regretted this sad want of principle



<P>so much as Miss Murray herself; not only because she had taken a



<P>fancy to me, but because there was so much of what was pleasant and



<P>prepossessing in herself, that, in spite of her failings, I really



<P>liked her - when she did not rouse my indignation, or ruffle my



<P>temper by TOO great a display of her faults.&nbsp; These, however, I



<P>would fain persuade myself were rather the effect of her education



<P>than her disposition:&nbsp; she had never been perfectly taught the



<P>distinction between right and wrong; she had, like her brothers and



<P>sisters, been suffered, from infancy, to tyrannize over nurses,



<P>governesses, and servants; she had not been taught to moderate her



<P>desires, to control her temper or bridle her will, or to sacrifice



<P>her own pleasure for the good of others.&nbsp; Her temper being



<P>naturally good, she was never violent or morose, but from constant



<P>indulgence, and habitual scorn of reason, she was often testy and



<P>capricious; her mind had never been cultivated:&nbsp; her intellect,

at



<P>best, was somewhat shallow; she possessed considerable vivacity,



<P>some quickness of perception, and some talent for music and the



<P>acquisition of languages, but till fifteen she had troubled herself



<P>to acquire nothing; - then the love of display had roused her



<P>faculties, and induced her to apply herself, but only to the more



<P>showy accomplishments.&nbsp; And when I came it was the same:



<P>everything was neglected but French, German, music, singing,



<P>dancing, fancy-work, and a little drawing - such drawing as might



<P>produce the greatest show with the smallest labour, and the



<P>principal parts of which were generally done by me.&nbsp; For music

and



<P>singing, besides my occasional instructions, she had the attendance



<P>of the best master the country afforded; and in these



<P>accomplishments, as well as in dancing, she certainly attained



<P>great proficiency.&nbsp; To music, indeed, she devoted too much of her



<P>time, as, governess though I was, I frequently told her; but her



<P>mother thought that if SHE liked it, she COULD not give too much



<P>time to the acquisition of so attractive an art.&nbsp; Of fancy-work

I



<P>knew nothing but what I gathered from my pupil and my own



<P>observation; but no sooner was I initiated, than she made me useful



<P>in twenty different ways:&nbsp; all the tedious parts of her work were



<P>shifted on to my shoulders; such as stretching the frames,



<P>stitching in the canvas, sorting the wools and silks, putting in



<P>the grounds, counting the stitches, rectifying mistakes, and



<P>finishing the pieces she was tired of.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At sixteen, Miss Murray was something of a romp, yet not more so



<P>than is natural and allowable for a girl of that age, but at



<P>seventeen, that propensity, like all other things, began to give



<P>way to the ruling passion, and soon was swallowed up in the all-



<P>absorbing ambition to attract and dazzle the other sex.&nbsp; But enough



<P>of her:&nbsp; now let us turn to her sister.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Matilda Murray was a veritable hoyden, of whom little need be



<P>said.&nbsp; She was about two years and a half younger than her sister;



<P>her features were larger, her complexion much darker.&nbsp; She might



<P>possibly make a handsome woman; but she was far too big-boned and



<P>awkward ever to be called a pretty girl, and at present she cared



<P>little about it.&nbsp; Rosalie knew all her charms, and thought them



<P>even greater than they were, and valued them more highly than she



<P>ought to have done, had they been three times as great; Matilda



<P>thought she was well enough, but cared little about the matter;



<P>still less did she care about the cultivation of her mind, and the



<P>acquisition of ornamental accomplishments.&nbsp; The manner in which

she



<P>learnt her lessons and practised her music was calculated to drive



<P>any governess to despair.&nbsp; Short and easy as her tasks were, if



<P>done at all, they were slurred over, at any time and in any way;



<P>but generally at the least convenient times, and in the way least



<P>beneficial to herself, and least satisfactory to me:&nbsp; the short



<P>half-hour of practising was horribly strummed through; she,



<P>meantime, unsparingly abusing me, either for interrupting her with



<P>corrections, or for not rectifying her mistakes before they were



<P>made, or something equally unreasonable.&nbsp; Once or twice, I ventured



<P>to remonstrate with her seriously for such irrational conduct; but



<P>on each of those occasions, I received such reprehensive



<P>expostulations from her mother, as convinced me that, if I wished



<P>to keep the situation, I must even let Miss Matilda go on in her



<P>own way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When her lessons were over, however, her ill-humour was generally



<P>over too:&nbsp; while riding her spirited pony, or romping with the

dogs



<P>or her brothers and sister, but especially with her dear brother



<P>John, she was as happy as a lark.&nbsp; As an animal, Matilda was all



<P>right, full of life, vigour, and activity; as an intelligent being,



<P>she was barbarously ignorant, indocile, careless and irrational;



<P>and, consequently, very distressing to one who had the task of



<P>cultivating her understanding, reforming her manners, and aiding



<P>her to acquire those ornamental attainments which, unlike her



<P>sister, she despised as much as the rest.&nbsp; Her mother was partly



<P>aware of her deficiencies, and gave me many a lecture as to how I



<P>should try to form her tastes, and endeavour to rouse and cherish



<P>her dormant vanity; and, by insinuating, skilful flattery, to win



<P>her attention to the desired objects - which I would not do; and



<P>how I should prepare and smooth the path of learning till she could



<P>glide along it without the least exertion to herself:&nbsp; which I



<P>could not, for nothing can be taught to any purpose without some



<P>little exertion on the part of the learner.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As a moral agent, Matilda was reckless, headstrong, violent, and



<P>unamenable to reason.&nbsp; One proof of the deplorable state of her



<P>mind was, that from her father's example she had learned to swear



<P>like a trooper.&nbsp; Her mother was greatly shocked at the 'unlady-like



<P>trick,' and wondered 'how she had picked it up.'&nbsp; 'But you can

soon



<P>break her of it, Miss Grey,' said she:&nbsp; 'it is only a habit; and

if



<P>you will just gently remind her every time she does so, I am sure



<P>she will soon lay it aside.'&nbsp; I not only 'gently reminded' her,

I



<P>tried to impress upon her how wrong it was, and how distressing to



<P>the ears of decent people:&nbsp; but all in vain:&nbsp; I was only answered



<P>by a careless laugh, and, 'Oh, Miss Grey, how shocked you are!&nbsp;

I'm



<P>so glad!' or, 'Well!&nbsp; I can't help it; papa shouldn't have taught



<P>me:&nbsp; I learned it all from him; and maybe a bit from the coachman.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her brother John, ALIAS Master Murray, was about eleven when I



<P>came:&nbsp; a fine, stout, healthy boy, frank and good-natured in the



<P>main, and might have been a decent lad had he been properly



<P>educated; but now he was as rough as a young bear, boisterous,



<P>unruly, unprincipled, untaught, unteachable - at least, for a



<P>governess under his mother's eye.&nbsp; His masters at school might

be



<P>able to manage him better - for to school he was sent, greatly to



<P>my relief, in the course of a year; in a state, it is true, of



<P>scandalous ignorance as to Latin, as well as the more useful though



<P>more neglected things:&nbsp; and this, doubtless, would all be laid

to



<P>the account of his education having been entrusted to an ignorant



<P>female teacher, who had presumed to take in hand what she was



<P>wholly incompetent to perform.&nbsp; I was not delivered from his



<P>brother till full twelve months after, when he also was despatched



<P>in the same state of disgraceful ignorance as the former.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Master Charles was his mother's peculiar darling.&nbsp; He was little



<P>more than a year younger than John, but much smaller, paler, and



<P>less active and robust; a pettish, cowardly, capricious, selfish



<P>little fellow, only active in doing mischief, and only clever in



<P>inventing falsehoods:&nbsp; not simply to hide his faults, but, in mere



<P>malicious wantonness, to bring odium upon others.&nbsp; In fact, Master



<P>Charles was a very great nuisance to me:&nbsp; it was a trial of



<P>patience to live with him peaceably; to watch over him was worse;



<P>and to teach him, or pretend to teach him, was inconceivable.&nbsp;

At



<P>ten years old, he could not read correctly the easiest line in the



<P>simplest book; and as, according to his mother's principle, he was



<P>to be told every word, before he had time to hesitate or examine



<P>its orthography, and never even to be informed, as a stimulant to



<P>exertion, that other boys were more forward than he, it is not



<P>surprising that he made but little progress during the two years I



<P>had charge of his education.&nbsp; His minute portions of Latin grammar,



<P>&amp;c., were to be repeated over to him, till he chose to say he knew



<P>them, and then he was to be helped to say them; if he made mistakes



<P>in his little easy sums in arithmetic, they were to be shown him at



<P>once, and the sum done for him, instead of his being left to



<P>exercise his faculties in finding them out himself; so that, of



<P>course, he took no pains to avoid mistakes, but frequently set down



<P>his figures at random, without any calculation at all.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I did not invariably confine myself to these rules:&nbsp; it was against



<P>my conscience to do so; but I seldom could venture to deviate from



<P>them in the slightest degree, without incurring the wrath of my



<P>little pupil, and subsequently of his mamma; to whom he would



<P>relate my transgressions maliciously exaggerated, or adorned with



<P>embellishments of his own; and often, in consequence, was I on the



<P>point of losing or resigning my situation.&nbsp; But, for their sakes

at



<P>home, I smothered my pride and suppressed my indignation, and



<P>managed to struggle on till my little tormentor was despatched to



<P>school; his father declaring that home education was 'no go; for



<P>him, it was plain; his mother spoiled him outrageously, and his



<P>governess could make no hand of him at all.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A few more observations about Horton Lodge and its ongoings, and I



<P>have done with dry description for the present.&nbsp; The house was

a



<P>very respectable one; superior to Mr. Bloomfield's, both in age,



<P>size, and magnificence:&nbsp; the garden was not so tastefully laid

out;



<P>but instead of the smooth-shaven lawn, the young trees guarded by



<P>palings, the grove of upstart poplars, and the plantation of firs,



<P>there was a wide park, stocked with deer, and beautified by fine



<P>old trees.&nbsp; The surrounding country itself was pleasant, as far

as



<P>fertile fields, flourishing trees, quiet green lanes, and smiling



<P>hedges with wild-flowers scattered along their banks, could make



<P>it; but it was depressingly flat to one born and nurtured among the



<P>rugged hills of -.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>We were situated nearly two miles from the village church, and,



<P>consequently, the family carriage was put in requisition every



<P>Sunday morning, and sometimes oftener.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. Murray



<P>generally thought it sufficient to show themselves at church once



<P>in the course of the day; but frequently the children preferred



<P>going a second time to wandering about the grounds all the day with



<P>nothing to do.&nbsp; If some of my pupils chose to walk and take me

with



<P>them, it was well for me; for otherwise my position in the carriage



<P>was to be crushed into the corner farthest from the open window,



<P>and with my back to the horses:&nbsp; a position which invariably made



<P>me sick; and if I were not actually obliged to leave the church in



<P>the middle of the service, my devotions were disturbed with a



<P>feeling of languor and sickliness, and the tormenting fear of its



<P>becoming worse:&nbsp; and a depressing headache was generally my



<P>companion throughout the day, which would otherwise have been one



<P>of welcome rest, and holy, calm enjoyment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'It's very odd, Miss Grey, that the carriage should always make you



<P>sick:&nbsp; it never makes ME,' remarked Miss Matilda,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Nor me either,' said her sister; 'but I dare say it would, if I



<P>sat where she does - such a nasty, horrid place, Miss Grey; I



<P>wonder how you can bear it!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I am obliged to bear it, since no choice is left me,' - I might



<P>have answered; but in tenderness for their feelings I only replied,



<P>- 'Oh! it is but a short way, and if I am not sick in church, I



<P>don't mind it.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If I were called upon to give a description of the usual divisions



<P>and arrangements of the day, I should find it a very difficult



<P>matter.&nbsp; I had all my meals in the schoolroom with my pupils, at



<P>such times as suited their fancy:&nbsp; sometimes they would ring for



<P>dinner before it was half cooked; sometimes they would keep it



<P>waiting on the table for above an hour, and then be out of humour



<P>because the potatoes were cold, and the gravy covered with cakes of



<P>solid fat; sometimes they would have tea at four; frequently, they



<P>would storm at the servants because it was not in precisely at



<P>five; and when these orders were obeyed, by way of encouragement to



<P>punctuality, they would keep it on the table till seven or eight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Their hours of study were managed in much the same way; my judgment



<P>or convenience was never once consulted.&nbsp; Sometimes Matilda and



<P>John would determine 'to get all the plaguy business over before



<P>breakfast,' and send the maid to call me up at half-past five,



<P>without any scruple or apology; sometimes, I was told to be ready



<P>precisely at six, and, having dressed in a hurry, came down to an



<P>empty room, and after waiting a long time in suspense, discovered



<P>that they had changed their minds, and were still in bed; or,



<P>perhaps, if it were a fine summer morning, Brown would come to tell



<P>me that the young ladies and gentlemen had taken a holiday, and



<P>were gone out; and then I was kept waiting for breakfast till I was



<P>almost ready to faint:&nbsp; they having fortified themselves with



<P>something before they went.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Often they would do their lessons in the open air; which I had



<P>nothing to say against:&nbsp; except that I frequently caught cold by



<P>sitting on the damp grass, or from exposure to the evening dew, or



<P>some insidious draught, which seemed to have no injurious effect on



<P>them.&nbsp; It was quite right that they should be hardy; yet, surely,



<P>they might have been taught some consideration for others who were



<P>less so.&nbsp; But I must not blame them for what was, perhaps, my own



<P>fault; for I never made any particular objections to sitting where



<P>they pleased; foolishly choosing to risk the consequences, rather



<P>than trouble them for my convenience.&nbsp; Their indecorous manner

of



<P>doing their lessons was quite as remarkable as the caprice



<P>displayed in their choice of time and place.&nbsp; While receiving my



<P>instructions, or repeating what they had learned, they would lounge



<P>upon the sofa, lie on the rug, stretch, yawn, talk to each other,



<P>or look out of the window; whereas, I could not so much as stir the



<P>fire, or pick up the handkerchief I had dropped, without being



<P>rebuked for inattention by one of my pupils, or told that 'mamma



<P>would not like me to be so careless.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The servants, seeing in what little estimation the governess was



<P>held by both parents and children, regulated their behaviour by the



<P>same standard.&nbsp; I have frequently stood up for them, at the risk

of



<P>some injury to myself, against the tyranny and injustice of their



<P>young masters and mistresses; and I always endeavoured to give them



<P>as little trouble as possible:&nbsp; but they entirely neglected my



<P>comfort, despised my requests, and slighted my directions.&nbsp; All



<P>servants, I am convinced, would not have done so; but domestics in



<P>general, being ignorant and little accustomed to reason and



<P>reflection, are too easily corrupted by the carelessness and bad



<P>example of those above them; and these, I think, were not of the



<P>best order to begin with.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I sometimes felt myself degraded by the life I led, and ashamed of



<P>submitting to so many indignities; and sometimes I thought myself a



<P>fool for caring so much about them, and feared I must be sadly



<P>wanting in Christian humility, or that charity which 'suffereth



<P>long and is kind, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked,



<P>beareth all things, endureth all things.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But, with time and patience, matters began to be slightly



<P>ameliorated:&nbsp; slowly, it is true, and almost imperceptibly; but

I



<P>got rid of my male pupils (that was no trifling advantage), and the



<P>girls, as I intimated before concerning one of them, became a



<P>little less insolent, and began to show some symptoms of esteem.



<P>'Miss Grey was a queer creature:&nbsp; she never flattered, and did

not



<P>praise them half enough; but whenever she did speak favourably of



<P>them, or anything belonging to them, they could be quite sure her



<P>approbation was sincere.&nbsp; She was very obliging, quiet, and



<P>peaceable in the main, but there were some things that put her out



<P>of temper:&nbsp; they did not much care for that, to be sure, but still



<P>it was better to keep her in tune; as when she was in a good humour



<P>she would talk to them, and be very agreeable and amusing



<P>sometimes, in her way; which was quite different to mamma's, but



<P>still very well for a change.&nbsp; She had her own opinions on every



<P>subject, and kept steadily to them - very tiresome opinions they



<P>often were; as she was always thinking of what was right and what



<P>was wrong, and had a strange reverence for matters connected with



<P>religion, and an unaccountable liking to good people.'

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>CHAPTER VI - THE PARSONAGE AGAIN</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>FOR a few months I remained peaceably at home, in the quiet



<P>enjoyment of liberty and rest, and genuine friendship, from all of



<P>which I had fasted so long; and in the earnest prosecution of my



<P>studies, to recover what I had lost during my stay at Wellwood



<P>House, and to lay in new stores for future use.&nbsp; My father's health



<P>was still very infirm, but not materially worse than when I last



<P>saw him; and I was glad I had it in my power to cheer him by my



<P>return, and to amuse him with singing his favourite songs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>No one triumphed over my failure, or said I had better have taken



<P>his or her advice, and quietly stayed at home.&nbsp; All were glad to



<P>have me back again, and lavished more kindness than ever upon me,



<P>to make up for the sufferings I had undergone; but not one would



<P>touch a shilling of what I had so cheerfully earned and so



<P>carefully saved, in the hope of sharing it with them.&nbsp; By dint

of



<P>pinching here, and scraping there, our debts were already nearly



<P>paid.&nbsp; Mary had had good success with her drawings; but our father



<P>had insisted upon HER likewise keeping all the produce of her



<P>industry to herself.&nbsp; All we could spare from the supply of our



<P>humble wardrobe and our little casual expenses, he directed us to



<P>put into the savings'-bank; saying, we knew not how soon we might



<P>be dependent on that alone for support:&nbsp; for he felt he had not



<P>long to be with us, and what would become of our mother and us when



<P>he was gone, God only knew!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Dear papa! if he had troubled himself less about the afflictions



<P>that threatened us in case of his death, I am convinced that



<P>dreaded event would not have taken place so soon.&nbsp; My mother would



<P>never suffer him to ponder on the subject if she could help it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, Richard!' exclaimed she, on one occasion, 'if you would but



<P>dismiss such gloomy subjects from your mind, you would live as long



<P>as any of us; at least you would live to see the girls married, and



<P>yourself a happy grandfather, with a canty old dame for your



<P>companion.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>My mother laughed, and so did my father:&nbsp; but his laugh soon



<P>perished in a dreary sigh.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'THEY married - poor penniless things!' said he; 'who will take



<P>them I wonder!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Why, nobody shall that isn't thankful for them.&nbsp; Wasn't I



<P>penniless when you took me? and you PRETENDED, at least, to be



<P>vastly pleased with your acquisition.&nbsp; But it's no matter whether



<P>they get married or not:&nbsp; we can devise a thousand honest ways

of



<P>making a livelihood.&nbsp; And I wonder, Richard, you can think of



<P>bothering your head about our POVERTY in case of your death; as if



<P>THAT would be anything compared with the calamity of losing you -



<P>an affliction that you well know would swallow up all others, and



<P>which you ought to do your utmost to preserve us from:&nbsp; and there



<P>is nothing like a cheerful mind for keeping the body in health.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I know, Alice, it is wrong to keep repining as I do, but I cannot



<P>help it:&nbsp; you must bear with me.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I WON'T bear with you, if I can alter you,' replied my mother:



<P>but the harshness of her words was undone by the earnest affection



<P>of her tone and pleasant smile, that made my father smile again,



<P>less sadly and less transiently than was his wont.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Mamma,' said I, as soon as I could find an opportunity of speaking



<P>with her alone, 'my money is but little, and cannot last long; if I



<P>could increase it, it would lessen papa's anxiety, on one subject



<P>at least.&nbsp; I cannot draw like Mary, and so the best thing I could



<P>do would be to look out for another situation.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And so you would actually try again, Agnes?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Decidedly, I would.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Why, my dear, I should have thought you had had enough of it.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I know,' said I, 'everybody is not like Mr. and Mrs. Bloomfield -



<P>'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Some are worse,' interrupted my mother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But not many, I think,' replied I, 'and I'm sure all children are



<P>not like theirs; for I and Mary were not:&nbsp; we always did as you

bid



<P>us, didn't we?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Generally:&nbsp; but then, I did not spoil you; and you were not



<P>perfect angels after all:&nbsp; Mary had a fund of quiet obstinacy,

and



<P>you were somewhat faulty in regard to temper; but you were very



<P>good children on the whole.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I know I was sulky sometimes, and I should have been glad to see



<P>these children sulky sometimes too; for then I could have



<P>understood them:&nbsp; but they never were, for they COULD not be



<P>offended, nor hurt, nor ashamed:&nbsp; they could not be unhappy in

any



<P>way, except when they were in a passion.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, if they COULD not, it was not their fault:&nbsp; you cannot



<P>expect stone to be as pliable as clay.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No, but still it is very unpleasant to live with such



<P>unimpressible, incomprehensible creatures.&nbsp; You cannot love them;



<P>and if you could, your love would be utterly thrown away:&nbsp; they



<P>could neither return it, nor value, nor understand it.&nbsp; But,



<P>however, even if I should stumble on such a family again, which is



<P>quite unlikely, I have all this experience to begin with, and I



<P>should manage better another time; and the end and aim of this



<P>preamble is, let me try again.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, my girl, you are not easily discouraged, I see:&nbsp; I am glad



<P>of that.&nbsp; But, let me tell you, you are a good deal paler and



<P>thinner than when you first left home; and we cannot have you



<P>undermining your health to hoard up money either for yourself or



<P>others.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Mary tells me I am changed too; and I don't much wonder at it, for



<P>I was in a constant state of agitation and anxiety all day long:



<P>but next time I am determined to take things coolly.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After some further discussion, my mother promised once more to



<P>assist me, provided I would wait and be patient; and I left her to



<P>broach the matter to my father, when and how she deemed it most



<P>advisable:&nbsp; never doubting her ability to obtain his consent.



<P>Meantime, I searched, with great interest, the advertising columns



<P>of the newspapers, and wrote answers to every 'Wanted a Governess'



<P>that appeared at all eligible; but all my letters, as well as the



<P>replies, when I got any, were dutifully shown to my mother; and



<P>she, to my chagrin, made me reject the situations one after



<P>another:&nbsp; these were low people, these were too exacting in their



<P>demands, and these too niggardly in their remuneration.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Your talents are not such as every poor clergyman's daughter



<P>possesses, Agnes,' she would say, 'and you must not throw them



<P>away.&nbsp; Remember, you promised to be patient:&nbsp; there is no

need of



<P>hurry:&nbsp; you have plenty of time before you, and may have many



<P>chances yet.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At length, she advised me to put an advertisement, myself, in the



<P>paper, stating my qualifications, &amp;c.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Music, singing, drawing, French, Latin, and German,' said she,



<P>'are no mean assemblage:&nbsp; many will be glad to have so much in

one



<P>instructor; and this time, you shall try your fortune in a somewhat



<P>higher family in that of some genuine, thoroughbred gentleman; for



<P>such are far more likely to treat you with proper respect and



<P>consideration than those purse-proud tradespeople and arrogant



<P>upstarts.&nbsp; I have known several among the higher ranks who treated



<P>their governesses quite as one of the family; though some, I allow,



<P>are as insolent and exacting as any one else can be:&nbsp; for there

are



<P>bad and good in all classes.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The advertisement was quickly written and despatched.&nbsp; Of the two



<P>parties who answered it, but one would consent to give me fifty



<P>pounds, the sum my mother bade me name as the salary I should



<P>require; and here, I hesitated about engaging myself, as I feared



<P>the children would be too old, and their parents would require some



<P>one more showy, or more experienced, if not more accomplished than



<P>I.&nbsp; But my mother dissuaded me from declining it on that account:



<P>I should do vastly well, she said, if I would only throw aside my



<P>diffidence, and acquire a little more confidence in myself.&nbsp; I

was



<P>just to give a plain, true statement of my acquirements and



<P>qualifications, and name what stipulations I chose to make, and



<P>then await the result.&nbsp; The only stipulation I ventured to propose,



<P>was that I might be allowed two months' holidays during the year to



<P>visit my friends, at Midsummer and Christmas.&nbsp; The unknown lady,

in



<P>her reply, made no objection to this, and stated that, as to my



<P>acquirements, she had no doubt I should be able to give



<P>satisfaction; but in the engagement of governesses she considered



<P>those things as but subordinate points; as being situated in the



<P>neighbourhood of O-, she could get masters to supply any



<P>deficiencies in that respect:&nbsp; but, in her opinion, next to



<P>unimpeachable morality, a mild and cheerful temper and obliging



<P>disposition were the most essential requisities.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>My mother did not relish this at all, and now made many objections



<P>to my accepting the situation; in which my sister warmly supported



<P>her:&nbsp; but, unwilling to be balked again, I overruled them all;

and,



<P>having first obtained the consent of my father (who had, a short



<P>time previously, been apprised of these transactions), I wrote a



<P>most obliging epistle to my unknown correspondent, and, finally,



<P>the bargain was concluded.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was decreed that on the last day of January I was to enter upon



<P>my new office as governess in the family of Mr. Murray, of Horton



<P>Lodge, near O-, about seventy miles from our village:&nbsp; a formidable



<P>distance to me, as I had never been above twenty miles from home in



<P>all the course of my twenty years' sojourn on earth; and as,



<P>moreover, every individual in that family and in the neighbourhood



<P>was utterly unknown to myself and all my acquaintances.&nbsp; But this



<P>rendered it only the more piquant to me.&nbsp; I had now, in some



<P>measure, got rid of the MAUVAISE HONTE that had formerly oppressed



<P>me so much; there was a pleasing excitement in the idea of entering



<P>these unknown regions, and making my way alone among its strange



<P>inhabitants.&nbsp; I now flattered myself I was going to see something



<P>in the world:&nbsp; Mr. Murray's residence was near a large town, and



<P>not in a manufacturing district, where the people had nothing to do



<P>but to make money; his rank from what I could gather, appeared to



<P>be higher than that of Mr. Bloomfield; and, doubtless, he was one



<P>of those genuine thorough-bred gentry my mother spoke of, who would



<P>treat his governess with due consideration as a respectable well-



<P>educated lady, the instructor and guide of his children, and not a



<P>mere upper servant.&nbsp; Then, my pupils being older, would be more



<P>rational, more teachable, and less troublesome than the last; they



<P>would be less confined to the schoolroom, and not require that



<P>constant labour and incessant watching; and, finally, bright



<P>visions mingled with my hopes, with which the care of children and



<P>the mere duties of a governess had little or nothing to do.&nbsp; Thus,



<P>the reader will see that I had no claim to be regarded as a martyr



<P>to filial piety, going forth to sacrifice peace and liberty for the



<P>sole purpose of laying up stores for the comfort and support of my



<P>parents:&nbsp; though certainly the comfort of my father, and the future



<P>support of my mother, had a large share in my calculations; and



<P>fifty pounds appeared to me no ordinary sum.&nbsp; I must have decent



<P>clothes becoming my station; I must, it seemed, put out my washing,



<P>and also pay for my four annual journeys between Horton Lodge and



<P>home; but with strict attention to economy, surely twenty pounds,



<P>or little more, would cover those expenses, and then there would be



<P>thirty for the bank, or little less:&nbsp; what a valuable addition

to



<P>our stock!&nbsp; Oh, I must struggle to keep this situation, whatever

it



<P>might be! both for my own honour among my friends and for the solid



<P>services I might render them by my continuance there.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>CHAPTER XII - THE SHOWER</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>THE next visit I paid to Nancy Brown was in the second week in



<P>March:&nbsp; for, though I had many spare minutes during the day, I



<P>seldom could look upon an hour as entirely my own; since, where



<P>everything was left to the caprices of Miss Matilda and her sister,



<P>there could be no order or regularity.&nbsp; Whatever occupation I



<P>chose, when not actually busied about them or their concerns, I



<P>had, as it were, to keep my loins girded, my shoes on my feet, and



<P>my staff in my hand; for not to be immediately forthcoming when



<P>called for, was regarded as a grave and inexcusable offence:&nbsp; not



<P>only by my pupils and their mother, but by the very servant, who



<P>came in breathless haste to call me, exclaiming, 'You're to go to



<P>the schoolroom DIRECTLY, mum, the young ladies is WAITING!!'



<P>Climax of horror! actually waiting for their governess!!!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But this time I was pretty sure of an hour or two to myself; for



<P>Matilda was preparing for a long ride, and Rosalie was dressing for



<P>a dinner-party at Lady Ashby's:&nbsp; so I took the opportunity of



<P>repairing to the widow's cottage, where I found her in some anxiety



<P>about her cat, which had been absent all day.&nbsp; I comforted her

with



<P>as many anecdotes of that animal's roving propensities as I could



<P>recollect.&nbsp; 'I'm feared o' th' gamekeepers,' said she:&nbsp; 'that's

all



<P>'at I think on.&nbsp; If th' young gentlemen had been at home, I should



<P>a' thought they'd been setting their dogs at her, an' worried her,



<P>poor thing, as they did MANY a poor thing's cat; but I haven't that



<P>to be feared on now.'&nbsp; Nancy's eyes were better, but still far

from



<P>well:&nbsp; she had been trying to make a Sunday shirt for her son,

but



<P>told me she could only bear to do a little bit at it now and then,



<P>so that it progressed but slowly, though the poor lad wanted it



<P>sadly.&nbsp; So I proposed to help her a little, after I had read to



<P>her, for I had plenty of time that evening, and need not return



<P>till dusk.&nbsp; She thankfully accepted the offer.&nbsp; 'An' you'll

be a



<P>bit o' company for me too, Miss,' said she; 'I like as I feel



<P>lonesome without my cat.'&nbsp; But when I had finished reading, and



<P>done the half of a seam, with Nancy's capacious brass thimble



<P>fitted on to my finger by means of a roll of paper, I was disturbed



<P>by the entrance of Mr. Weston, with the identical cat in his arms.



<P>I now saw that he could smile, and very pleasantly too.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I've done you a piece of good service, Nancy,' he began:&nbsp; then



<P>seeing me, he acknowledged my presence by a slight bow.&nbsp; I should



<P>have been invisible to Hatfield, or any other gentleman of those



<P>parts.&nbsp; 'I've delivered your cat,' he continued, 'from the hands,



<P>or rather the gun, of Mr. Murray's gamekeeper.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'God bless you, sir!' cried the grateful old woman, ready to weep



<P>for joy as she received her favourite from his arms.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Take care of it,' said he, 'and don't let it go near the rabbit-



<P>warren, for the gamekeeper swears he'll shoot it if he sees it



<P>there again:&nbsp; he would have done so to-day, if I had not been in



<P>time to stop him.&nbsp; I believe it is raining, Miss Grey,' added he,



<P>more quietly, observing that I had put aside my work, and was



<P>preparing to depart.&nbsp; 'Don't let me disturb you - I shan't stay

two



<P>minutes.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'You'll BOTH stay while this shower gets owered,' said Nancy, as



<P>she stirred the fire, and placed another chair beside it; 'what!



<P>there's room for all.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I can see better here, thank you, Nancy,' replied I, taking my



<P>work to the window, where she had the goodness to suffer me to



<P>remain unmolested, while she got a brush to remove the cat's hairs



<P>from Mr. Weston's coat, carefully wiped the rain from his hat, and



<P>gave the cat its supper, busily talking all the time:&nbsp; now thanking



<P>her clerical friend for what he had done; now wondering how the cat



<P>had found out the warren; and now lamenting the probable



<P>consequences of such a discovery.&nbsp; He listened with a quiet, good-



<P>natured smile, and at length took a seat in compliance with her



<P>pressing invitations, but repeated that he did not mean to stay.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I have another place to go to,' said he, 'and I see' (glancing at



<P>the book on the table) 'someone else has been reading to you.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes, sir; Miss Grey has been as kind as read me a chapter; an' now



<P>she's helping me with a shirt for our Bill - but I'm feared she'll



<P>be cold there.&nbsp; Won't you come to th' fire, Miss?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No, thank you, Nancy, I'm quite warm.&nbsp; I must go as soon as this



<P>shower is over.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, Miss!&nbsp; You said you could stop while dusk!' cried the



<P>provoking old woman, and Mr. Weston seized his hat.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Nay, sir,' exclaimed she, 'pray don't go now, while it rains so



<P>fast.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But it strikes me I'm keeping your visitor away from the fire.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No, you're not, Mr. Weston,' replied I, hoping there was no harm



<P>in a falsehood of that description.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No, sure!' cried Nancy.&nbsp; 'What, there's lots o' room!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Miss Grey,' said he, half-jestingly, as if he felt it necessary to



<P>change the present subject, whether he had anything particular to



<P>say or not, 'I wish you would make my peace with the squire, when



<P>you see him.&nbsp; He was by when I rescued Nancy's cat, and did not



<P>quite approve of the deed.&nbsp; I told him I thought he might better



<P>spare all his rabbits than she her cat, for which audacious



<P>assertion he treated me to some rather ungentlemanly language; and



<P>I fear I retorted a trifle too warmly.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, lawful sir!&nbsp; I hope you didn't fall out wi' th' maister for



<P>sake o' my cat! he cannot bide answering again - can th' maister.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh! it's no matter, Nancy:&nbsp; I don't care about it, really; I said



<P>nothing VERY uncivil; and I suppose Mr. Murray is accustomed to use



<P>rather strong language when he's heated.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Ay, sir:&nbsp; it's a pity.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And now, I really must go.&nbsp; I have to visit a place a mile beyond



<P>this; and you would not have me to return in the dark:&nbsp; besides,

it



<P>has nearly done raining now - so good-evening, Nancy.&nbsp; Good-



<P>evening, Miss Grey.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Good-evening, Mr. Weston; but don't depend upon me for making your



<P>peace with Mr. Murray, for I never see him - to speak to.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Don't you; it can't be helped then,' replied he, in dolorous



<P>resignation:&nbsp; then, with a peculiar half-smile, he added, 'But



<P>never mind; I imagine the squire has more to apologise for than I;'



<P>and left the cottage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I went on with my sewing as long as I could see, and then bade



<P>Nancy good-evening; checking her too lively gratitude by the



<P>undeniable assurance that I had only done for her what she would



<P>have done for me, if she had been in my place and I in hers.&nbsp; I



<P>hastened back to Horton Lodge, where, having entered the



<P>schoolroom, I found the tea-table all in confusion, the tray



<P>flooded with slops, and Miss Matilda in a most ferocious humour.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Miss Grey, whatever have you been about?&nbsp; I've had tea half an



<P>hour ago, and had to make it myself, and drink it all alone!&nbsp; I



<P>wish you would come in sooner!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I've been to see Nancy Brown.&nbsp; I thought you would not be back



<P>from your ride.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'How could I ride in the rain, I should like to know.&nbsp; That damned



<P>pelting shower was vexatious enough - coming on when I was just in



<P>full swing:&nbsp; and then to come and find nobody in to tea! and you



<P>know I can't make the tea as I like it.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I didn't think of the shower,' replied I (and, indeed, the thought



<P>of its driving her home had never entered my head).

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No, of course; you were under shelter yourself, and you never



<P>thought of other people.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I bore her coarse reproaches with astonishing equanimity, even with



<P>cheerfulness; for I was sensible that I had done more good to Nancy



<P>Brown than harm to her:&nbsp; and perhaps some other thoughts assisted



<P>to keep up my spirits, and impart a relish to the cup of cold,



<P>overdrawn tea, and a charm to the otherwise unsightly table; and -



<P>I had almost said - to Miss Matilda's unamiable face.&nbsp; But she

soon



<P>betook herself to the stables, and left me to the quiet enjoyment



<P>of my solitary meal.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>CHAPTER IV - THE GRANDMAMMA</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>I SPARE my readers the account of my delight on coming home, my



<P>happiness while there - enjoying a brief space of rest and liberty



<P>in that dear, familiar place, among the loving and the loved - and



<P>my sorrow on being obliged to bid them, once more, a long adieu.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I returned, however, with unabated vigour to my work - a more



<P>arduous task than anyone can imagine, who has not felt something



<P>like the misery of being charged with the care and direction of a



<P>set of mischievous, turbulent rebels, whom his utmost exertions



<P>cannot bind to their duty; while, at the same time, he is



<P>responsible for their conduct to a higher power, who exacts from



<P>him what cannot be achieved without the aid of the superior's more



<P>potent authority; which, either from indolence, or the fear of



<P>becoming unpopular with the said rebellious gang, the latter



<P>refuses to give.&nbsp; I can conceive few situations more harassing

than



<P>that wherein, however you may long for success, however you may



<P>labour to fulfil your duty, your efforts are baffled and set at



<P>nought by those beneath you, and unjustly censured and misjudged by



<P>those above.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I have not enumerated half the vexatious propensities of my pupils,



<P>or half the troubles resulting from my heavy responsibilities, for



<P>fear of trespassing too much upon the reader's patience; as,



<P>perhaps, I have already done; but my design in writing the few last



<P>pages was not to amuse, but to benefit those whom it might concern;



<P>he that has no interest in such matters will doubtless have skipped



<P>them over with a cursory glance, and, perhaps, a malediction



<P>against the prolixity of the writer; but if a parent has,



<P>therefrom, gathered any useful hint, or an unfortunate governess



<P>received thereby the slightest benefit, I am well rewarded for my



<P>pains.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To avoid trouble and confusion, I have taken my pupils one by one,



<P>and discussed their various qualities; but this can give no



<P>adequate idea of being worried by the whole three together; when,



<P>as was often the case, all were determined to 'be naughty, and to



<P>tease Miss Grey, and put her in a passion.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sometimes, on such occasions, the thought has suddenly occurred to



<P>me - 'If they could see me now!' meaning, of course, my friends at



<P>home; and the idea of how they would pity me has made me pity



<P>myself - so greatly that I have had the utmost difficulty to



<P>restrain my tears:&nbsp; but I have restrained them, till my little



<P>tormentors were gone to dessert, or cleared off to bed (my only



<P>prospects of deliverance), and then, in all the bliss of solitude,



<P>I have given myself up to the luxury of an unrestricted burst of



<P>weeping.&nbsp; But this was a weakness I did not often indulge:&nbsp;

my



<P>employments were too numerous, my leisure moments too precious, to



<P>admit of much time being given to fruitless lamentations.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I particularly remember one wild, snowy afternoon, soon after my



<P>return in January:&nbsp; the children had all come up from dinner,



<P>loudly declaring that they meant 'to be naughty;' and they had well



<P>kept their resolution, though I had talked myself hoarse, and



<P>wearied every muscle in my throat, in the vain attempt to reason



<P>them out of it.&nbsp; I had got Tom pinned up in a corner, whence, I



<P>told him, he should not escape till he had done his appointed task.



<P>Meantime, Fanny had possessed herself of my work-bag, and was



<P>rifling its contents - and spitting into it besides.&nbsp; I told her

to



<P>let it alone, but to no purpose, of course.&nbsp; 'Burn it, Fanny!'



<P>cried Tom:&nbsp; and THIS command she hastened to obey.&nbsp; I sprang

to



<P>snatch it from the fire, and Tom darted to the door.&nbsp; 'Mary Ann,



<P>throw her desk out of the window!' cried he:&nbsp; and my precious desk,



<P>containing my letters and papers, my small amount of cash, and all



<P>my valuables, was about to be precipitated from the three-storey



<P>window.&nbsp; I flew to rescue it.&nbsp; Meanwhile Tom had left the

room, and



<P>was rushing down the stairs, followed by Fanny.&nbsp; Having secured

my



<P>desk, I ran to catch them, and Mary Ann came scampering after.&nbsp;

All



<P>three escaped me, and ran out of the house into the garden, where



<P>they plunged about in the snow, shouting and screaming in exultant



<P>glee.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>What must I do?&nbsp; If I followed them, I should probably be unable

to



<P>capture one, and only drive them farther away; if I did not, how



<P>was I to get them in?&nbsp; And what would their parents think of me,

if



<P>they saw or heard the children rioting, hatless, bonnetless,



<P>gloveless, and bootless, in the deep soft snow?&nbsp; While I stood

in



<P>this perplexity, just without the door, trying, by grim looks and



<P>angry words, to awe them into subjection, I heard a voice behind



<P>me, in harshly piercing tones, exclaiming, -

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Miss Grey!&nbsp; Is it possible?&nbsp; What, in the devil's name, can

you be



<P>thinking about?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I can't get them in, sir,' said I, turning round, and beholding



<P>Mr. Bloomfield, with his hair on end, and his pale blue eyes



<P>bolting from their sockets.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But I INSIST upon their being got in!' cried he, approaching



<P>nearer, and looking perfectly ferocious.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Then, sir, you must call them yourself, if you please, for they



<P>won't listen to me,' I replied, stepping back.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Come in with you, you filthy brats; or I'll horsewhip you every



<P>one!' roared he; and the children instantly obeyed.&nbsp; 'There, you



<P>see! - they come at the first word!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes, when YOU speak.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And it's very strange, that when you've the care of 'em you've no



<P>better control over 'em than that! - Now, there they are - gone up-



<P>stairs with their nasty snowy feet!&nbsp; Do go after 'em and see them



<P>made decent, for heaven's sake!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That gentleman's mother was then staying in the house; and, as I



<P>ascended the stairs and passed the drawing-room door, I had the



<P>satisfaction of hearing the old lady declaiming aloud to her



<P>daughter-in-law to this effect (for I could only distinguish the



<P>most emphatic words) -

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Gracious heavens! - never in all my life - ! - get their death as



<P>sure as - !&nbsp; Do you think, my dear, she's a PROPER PERSON?&nbsp;

Take my



<P>word for it - '

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I heard no more; but that sufficed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The senior Mrs. Bloomfield had been very attentive and civil to me;



<P>and till now I had thought her a nice, kind-hearted, chatty old



<P>body.&nbsp; She would often come to me and talk in a confidential



<P>strain; nodding and shaking her head, and gesticulating with hands



<P>and eyes, as a certain class of old ladies are won't to do; though



<P>I never knew one that carried the peculiarity to so great an



<P>extent.&nbsp; She would even sympathise with me for the trouble I had



<P>with the children, and express at times, by half sentences,



<P>interspersed with nods and knowing winks, her sense of the



<P>injudicious conduct of their mamma in so restricting my power, and



<P>neglecting to support me with her authority.&nbsp; Such a mode of



<P>testifying disapprobation was not much to my taste; and I generally



<P>refused to take it in, or understand anything more than was openly



<P>spoken; at least, I never went farther than an implied



<P>acknowledgment that, if matters were otherwise ordered my task



<P>would be a less difficult one, and I should be better able to guide



<P>and instruct my charge; but now I must be doubly cautious.



<P>Hitherto, though I saw the old lady had her defects (of which one



<P>was a proneness to proclaim her perfections), I had always been



<P>wishful to excuse them, and to give her credit for all the virtues



<P>she professed, and even imagine others yet untold.&nbsp; Kindness, which



<P>had been the food of my life through so many years, had lately been



<P>so entirely denied me, that I welcomed with grateful joy the



<P>slightest semblance of it.&nbsp; No wonder, then, that my heart warmed



<P>to the old lady, and always gladdened at her approach and regretted



<P>her departure.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But now, the few words luckily or unluckily heard in passing had



<P>wholly revolutionized my ideas respecting her:&nbsp; now I looked upon



<P>her as hypocritical and insincere, a flatterer, and a spy upon my



<P>words and deeds.&nbsp; Doubtless it would have been my interest still

to



<P>meet her with the same cheerful smile and tone of respectful



<P>cordiality as before; but I could not, if I would:&nbsp; my manner



<P>altered with my feelings, and became so cold and shy that she could



<P>not fail to notice it.&nbsp; She soon did notice it, and HER manner



<P>altered too:&nbsp; the familiar nod was changed to a stiff bow, the



<P>gracious smile gave place to a glare of Gorgon ferocity; her



<P>vivacious loquacity was entirely transferred from me to 'the



<P>darling boy and girls,' whom she flattered and indulged more



<P>absurdly than ever their mother had done.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I confess I was somewhat troubled at this change:&nbsp; I feared the



<P>consequences of her displeasure, and even made some efforts to



<P>recover the ground I had lost - and with better apparent success



<P>than I could have anticipated.&nbsp; At one time, I, merely in common



<P>civility, asked after her cough; immediately her long visage



<P>relaxed into a smile, and she favoured me with a particular history



<P>of that and her other infirmities, followed by an account of her



<P>pious resignation, delivered in the usual emphatic, declamatory



<P>style, which no writing can portray.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But there's one remedy for all, my dear, and that's resignation'



<P>(a toss of the head), 'resignation to the will of heaven!' (an



<P>uplifting of the hands and eyes).&nbsp; 'It has always supported me



<P>through all my trials, and always will do' (a succession of nods).



<P>'But then, it isn't everybody that can say that' (a shake of the



<P>head); 'but I'm one of the pious ones, Miss Grey!' (a very



<P>significant nod and toss).&nbsp; 'And, thank heaven, I always was'



<P>(another nod), 'and I glory in it!' (an emphatic clasping of the



<P>hands and shaking of the head).&nbsp; And with several texts of



<P>Scripture, misquoted or misapplied, and religious exclamations so



<P>redolent of the ludicrous in the style of delivery and manner of



<P>bringing in, if not in the expressions themselves, that I decline



<P>repeating them, she withdrew; tossing her large head in high good-



<P>humour - with herself at least - and left me hoping that, after



<P>all, she was rather weak than wicked.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At her next visit to Wellwood House, I went so far as to say I was



<P>glad to see her looking so well.&nbsp; The effect of this was magical:



<P>the words, intended as a mark of civility, were received as a



<P>flattering compliment; her countenance brightened up, and from that



<P>moment she became as gracious and benign as heart could wish - in



<P>outward semblance at least.&nbsp; From what I now saw of her, and what

I



<P>heard from the children, I know that, in order to gain her cordial



<P>friendship, I had but to utter a word of flattery at each



<P>convenient opportunity:&nbsp; but this was against my principles; and



<P>for lack of this, the capricious old dame soon deprived me of her



<P>favour again, and I believe did me much secret injury.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She could not greatly influence her daughter-in-law against me,



<P>because, between that lady and herself there was a mutual dislike -



<P>chiefly shown by her in secret detractions and calumniations; by



<P>the other, in an excess of frigid formality in her demeanour; and



<P>no fawning flattery of the elder could thaw away the wall of ice



<P>which the younger interposed between them.&nbsp; But with her son, the



<P>old lady had better success:&nbsp; he would listen to all she had to



<P>say, provided she could soothe his fretful temper, and refrain from



<P>irritating him by her own asperities; and I have reason to believe



<P>that she considerably strengthened his prejudice against me.&nbsp; She



<P>would tell him that I shamefully neglected the children, and even



<P>his wife did not attend to them as she ought; and that he must look



<P>after them himself, or they would all go to ruin.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Thus urged, he would frequently give himself the trouble of



<P>watching them from the windows during their play; at times, he



<P>would follow them through the grounds, and too often came suddenly



<P>upon them while they were dabbling in the forbidden well, talking



<P>to the coachman in the stables, or revelling in the filth of the



<P>farm-yard - and I, meanwhile, wearily standing, by, having



<P>previously exhausted my energy in vain attempts to get them away.



<P>Often, too, he would unexpectedly pop his head into the schoolroom



<P>while the young people were at meals, and find them spilling their



<P>milk over the table and themselves, plunging their fingers into



<P>their own or each other's mugs, or quarrelling over their victuals



<P>like a set of tiger's cubs.&nbsp; If I were quiet at the moment, I was



<P>conniving at their disorderly conduct; if (as was frequently the



<P>case) I happened to be exalting my voice to enforce order, I was



<P>using undue violence, and setting the girls a bad example by such



<P>ungentleness of tone and language.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I remember one afternoon in spring, when, owing to the rain, they



<P>could not go out; but, by some amazing good fortune, they had all



<P>finished their lessons, and yet abstained from running down to



<P>tease their parents - a trick that annoyed me greatly, but which,



<P>on rainy days, I seldom could prevent their doing; because, below,



<P>they found novelty and amusement - especially when visitors were in



<P>the house; and their mother, though she bid me keep them in the



<P>schoolroom, would never chide them for leaving it, or trouble



<P>herself to send them back.&nbsp; But this day they appeared satisfied



<P>with, their present abode, and what is more wonderful still, seemed



<P>disposed to play together without depending on me for amusement,



<P>and without quarrelling with each other.&nbsp; Their occupation was

a



<P>somewhat puzzling one:&nbsp; they were all squatted together on the



<P>floor by the window, over a heap of broken toys and a quantity of



<P>birds' eggs - or rather egg-shells, for the contents had luckily



<P>been abstracted.&nbsp; These shells they had broken up and were pounding



<P>into small fragments, to what end I could not imagine; but so long



<P>as they were quiet and not in positive mischief, I did not care;



<P>and, with a feeling of unusual repose, I sat by the fire, putting



<P>the finishing stitches to a frock for Mary Ann's doll; intending,



<P>when that was done, to begin a letter to my mother.&nbsp; Suddenly the



<P>door opened, and the dingy head of Mr. Bloomfield looked in.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'All very quiet here!&nbsp; What are you doing?' said he.&nbsp; 'No

harm TO-



<P>DAY, at least,' thought I.&nbsp; But he was of a different opinion.



<P>Advancing to the window, and seeing the children's occupations, he



<P>testily exclaimed - 'What in the world are you about?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'We're grinding egg-shells, papa!' cried Tom.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'How DARE you make such a mess, you little devils?&nbsp; Don't you see



<P>what confounded work you're making of the carpet?' (the carpet was



<P>a plain brown drugget).&nbsp; 'Miss Grey, did you know what they were



<P>doing?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes, sir.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'You knew it?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'You knew it! and you actually sat there and permitted them to go



<P>on without a word of reproof!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I didn't think they were doing any harm.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Any harm!&nbsp; Why, look there!&nbsp; Just look at that carpet, and

see -



<P>was there ever anything like it in a Christian house before?&nbsp; No



<P>wonder your room is not fit for a pigsty - no wonder your pupils



<P>are worse than a litter of pigs! - no wonder - oh! I declare, it



<P>puts me quite past my patience' and he departed, shutting the door



<P>after him with a bang that made the children laugh.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'It puts me quite past my patience too!' muttered I, getting up;



<P>and, seizing the poker, I dashed it repeatedly into the cinders,



<P>and stirred them up with unwonted energy; thus easing my irritation



<P>under pretence of mending the fire.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After this, Mr. Bloomfield was continually looking in to see if the



<P>schoolroom was in order; and, as the children were continually



<P>littering the floor with fragments of toys, sticks, stones,



<P>stubble, leaves, and other rubbish, which I could not prevent their



<P>bringing, or oblige them to gather up, and which the servants



<P>refused to 'clean after them,' I had to spend a considerable



<P>portion of my valuable leisure moments on my knees upon the floor,



<P>in painsfully reducing things to order.&nbsp; Once I told them that

they



<P>should not taste their supper till they had picked up everything



<P>from the carpet; Fanny might have hers when she had taken up a



<P>certain quantity, Mary Ann when she had gathered twice as many, and



<P>Tom was to clear away the rest.&nbsp; Wonderful to state, the girls

did



<P>their part; but Tom was in such a fury that he flew upon the table,



<P>scattered the bread and milk about the floor, struck his sisters,



<P>kicked the coals out of the coal-pan, attempted to overthrow the



<P>table and chairs, and seemed inclined to make a Douglas-larder of



<P>the whole contents of the room:&nbsp; but I seized upon him, and,



<P>sending Mary Ann to call her mamma, held him, in spite of kicks,



<P>blows, yells, and execrations, till Mrs. Bloomfield made her



<P>appearance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'What is the matter with my boy?' said she.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And when the matter was explained to her, all she did was to send



<P>for the nursery-maid to put the room in order, and bring Master



<P>Bloomfield his supper.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'There now,' cried Tom, triumphantly, looking up from his viands



<P>with his mouth almost too full for speech.&nbsp; 'There now, Miss Grey!



<P>you see I've got my supper in spite of you:&nbsp; and I haven't picked



<P>up a single thing!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The only person in the house who had any real sympathy for me was



<P>the nurse; for she had suffered like afflictions, though in a



<P>smaller degree; as she had not the task of teaching, nor was she so



<P>responsible for the conduct of her charge.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, Miss Grey!' she would say, 'you have some trouble with them



<P>childer!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I have, indeed, Betty; and I daresay you know what it is.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Ay, I do so!&nbsp; But I don't vex myself o'er 'em as you do.&nbsp;

And



<P>then, you see, I hit 'em a slap sometimes:&nbsp; and them little 'uns

-



<P>I gives 'em a good whipping now and then:&nbsp; there's nothing else



<P>will do for 'em, as what they say.&nbsp; Howsoever, I've lost my place



<P>for it.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Have you, Betty?&nbsp; I heard you were going to leave.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Eh, bless you, yes!&nbsp; Missis gave me warning a three wik sin'.&nbsp;

She



<P>told me afore Christmas how it mud be, if I hit 'em again; but I



<P>couldn't hold my hand off 'em at nothing.&nbsp; I know not how YOU do,



<P>for Miss Mary Ann's worse by the half nor her sisters!'

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>'WELL, Miss Grey, what do you think of the new curate?' asked Miss



<P>Murray, on our return from church the Sunday after the



<P>recommencement of our duties.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I can scarcely tell,' was my reply:&nbsp; 'I have not even heard him



<P>preach.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, but you saw him, didn't you?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes, but I cannot pretend to judge of a man's character by a



<P>single cursory glance at his face.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But isn't he ugly?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'He did not strike me as being particularly so; I don't dislike



<P>that cast of countenance:&nbsp; but the only thing I particularly



<P>noticed about him was his style of reading; which appeared to me



<P>good - infinitely better, at least, than Mr. Hatfield's.&nbsp; He read



<P>the Lessons as if he were bent on giving full effect to every



<P>passage; it seemed as if the most careless person could not have



<P>helped attending, nor the most ignorant have failed to understand;



<P>and the prayers he read as if he were not reading at all, but



<P>praying earnestly and sincerely from his own heart.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, yes, that's all he is good for:&nbsp; he can plod through the



<P>service well enough; but he has not a single idea beyond it.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'How do you know?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh! I know perfectly well; I am an excellent judge in such



<P>matters.&nbsp; Did you see how he went out of church? stumping along

-



<P>as if there were nobody there but himself - never looking to the



<P>right hand or the left, and evidently thinking of nothing but just



<P>getting out of the church, and, perhaps, home to his dinner:&nbsp; his



<P>great stupid head could contain no other idea.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I suppose you would have had him cast a glance into the squire's



<P>pew,' said I, laughing at the vehemence of her hostility.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Indeed! I should have been highly indignant if he had dared to do



<P>such a thing!' replied she, haughtily tossing her head; then, after



<P>a moment's reflection, she added - 'Well, well!&nbsp; I suppose he's



<P>good enough for his place:&nbsp; but I'm glad I'm not dependent on HIM



<P>for amusement - that's all.&nbsp; Did you see how Mr. Hatfield hurried



<P>out to get a bow from me, and be in time to put us into the



<P>carriage?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes,' answered I; internally adding, 'and I thought it somewhat



<P>derogatory to his dignity as a clergyman to come flying from the



<P>pulpit in such eager haste to shake hands with the squire, and hand



<P>his wife and daughters into their carriage:&nbsp; and, moreover, I owe



<P>him a grudge for nearly shutting me out of it'; for, in fact,



<P>though I was standing before his face, close beside the carriage



<P>steps, waiting to get in, he would persist in putting them up and



<P>closing the door, till one of the family stopped him by calling out



<P>that the governess was not in yet; then, without a word of apology,



<P>he departed, wishing them good-morning, and leaving the footman to



<P>finish the business.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>NOTA BENE. - Mr. Hatfield never spoke to me, neither did Sir Hugh



<P>or Lady Meltham, nor Mr. Harry or Miss Meltham, nor Mr. Green or



<P>his sisters, nor any other lady or gentleman who frequented that



<P>church:&nbsp; nor, in fact, any one that visited at Horton Lodge.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Murray ordered the carriage again, in the afternoon, for



<P>herself and her sister:&nbsp; she said it was too cold for them to enjoy



<P>themselves in the garden; and besides, she believed Harry Meltham



<P>would be at church.&nbsp; 'For,' said she, smiling slyly at her own

fair



<P>image in the glass, 'he has been a most exemplary attendant at



<P>church these last few Sundays:&nbsp; you would think he was quite a

good



<P>Christian.&nbsp; And you may go with us, Miss Grey:&nbsp; I want you

to see



<P>him; he is so greatly improved since he returned from abroad - you



<P>can't think!&nbsp; And besides, then you will have an opportunity of



<P>seeing the beautiful Mr. Weston again, and of hearing him preach.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I did hear him preach, and was decidedly pleased with the



<P>evangelical truth of his doctrine, as well as the earnest



<P>simplicity of his manner, and the clearness and force of his style.



<P>It was truly refreshing to hear such a sermon, after being so long



<P>accustomed to the dry, prosy discourses of the former curate, and



<P>the still less edifying harangues of the rector.&nbsp; Mr. Hatfield



<P>would come sailing up the aisle, or rather sweeping along like a



<P>whirlwind, with his rich silk gown flying behind him and rustling



<P>against the pew doors, mount the pulpit like a conqueror ascending



<P>his triumphal car; then, sinking on the velvet cushion in an



<P>attitude of studied grace, remain in silent prostration for a



<P>certain time; then mutter over a Collect, and gabble through the



<P>Lord's Prayer, rise, draw off one bright lavender glove, to give



<P>the congregation the benefit of his sparkling rings, lightly pass



<P>his fingers through his well-curled hair, flourish a cambric



<P>handkerchief, recite a very short passage, or, perhaps, a mere



<P>phrase of Scripture, as a head-piece to his discourse, and,



<P>finally, deliver a composition which, as a composition, might be



<P>considered good, though far too studied and too artificial to be



<P>pleasing to me:&nbsp; the propositions were well laid down, the



<P>arguments logically conducted; and yet, it was sometimes hard to



<P>listen quietly throughout, without some slight demonstrations of



<P>disapproval or impatience.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His favourite subjects were church discipline, rites and



<P>ceremonies, apostolical succession, the duty of reverence and



<P>obedience to the clergy, the atrocious criminality of dissent, the



<P>absolute necessity of observing all the forms of godliness, the



<P>reprehensible presumption of individuals who attempted to think for



<P>themselves in matters connected with religion, or to be guided by



<P>their own interpretations of Scripture, and, occasionally (to



<P>please his wealthy parishioners) the necessity of deferential



<P>obedience from the poor to the rich - supporting his maxims and



<P>exhortations throughout with quotations from the Fathers:&nbsp; with



<P>whom he appeared to be far better acquainted than with the Apostles



<P>and Evangelists, and whose importance he seemed to consider at



<P>least equal to theirs.&nbsp; But now and then he gave us a sermon of

a



<P>different order - what some would call a very good one; but sunless



<P>and severe:&nbsp; representing the Deity as a terrible taskmaster rather



<P>than a benevolent father.&nbsp; Yet, as I listened, I felt inclined

to



<P>think the man was sincere in all he said:&nbsp; he must have changed

his



<P>views, and become decidedly religious, gloomy and austere, yet



<P>still devout.&nbsp; But such illusions were usually dissipated, on



<P>coming out of church, by hearing his voice in jocund colloquy with



<P>some of the Melthams or Greens, or, perhaps, the Murrays



<P>themselves; probably laughing at his own sermon, and hoping that he



<P>had given the rascally people something to think about; perchance,



<P>exulting in the thought that old Betty Holmes would now lay aside



<P>the sinful indulgence of her pipe, which had been her daily solace



<P>for upwards of thirty years:&nbsp; that George Higgins would be



<P>frightened out of his Sabbath evening walks, and Thomas Jackson



<P>would be sorely troubled in his conscience, and shaken in his sure



<P>and certain hope of a joyful resurrection at the last day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Thus, I could not but conclude that Mr. Hatfield was one of those



<P>who 'bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne, and lay them



<P>upon men's shoulders, while they themselves will not move them with



<P>one of their fingers'; and who 'make the word of God of none effect



<P>by their traditions, teaching for doctrines the commandments of



<P>men.'&nbsp; I was well pleased to observe that the new curate resembled



<P>him, as far as I could see, in none of these particulars.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, Miss Grey, what do you think of him now?' said Miss Murray,



<P>as we took our places in the carriage after service.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No harm still,' replied I.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No harm!' repeated she in amazement.&nbsp; 'What do you mean?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I mean, I think no worse of him than I did before.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No worse!&nbsp; I should think not indeed - quite the contrary!&nbsp;

Is he



<P>not greatly improved?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, yes; very much indeed,' replied I; for I had now discovered



<P>that it was Harry Meltham she meant, not Mr. Weston.&nbsp; That



<P>gentleman had eagerly come forward to speak to the young ladies:&nbsp;

a



<P>thing he would hardly have ventured to do had their mother been



<P>present; he had likewise politely handed them into the carriage.



<P>He had not attempted to shut me out, like Mr. Hatfield; neither, of



<P>course, had he offered me his assistance (I should not have



<P>accepted it, if he had), but as long as the door remained open he



<P>had stood smirking and chatting with them, and then lifted his hat



<P>and departed to his own abode:&nbsp; but I had scarcely noticed him

all



<P>the time.&nbsp; My companions, however, had been more observant; and,

as



<P>we rolled along, they discussed between them not only his looks,



<P>words, and actions, but every feature of his face, and every



<P>article of his apparel.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'You shan't have him all to yourself, Rosalie,' said Miss Matilda



<P>at the close of this discussion; 'I like him:&nbsp; I know he'd make

a



<P>nice, jolly companion for me.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, you're quite welcome to him, Matilda,' replied her sister,



<P>in a tone of affected indifference.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And I'm sure,' continued the other, 'he admires me quite as much



<P>as he does you; doesn't he, Miss Grey?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I don't know; I'm not acquainted with his sentiments.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, but he DOES though.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'My DEAR Matilda! nobody will ever admire you till you get rid of



<P>your rough, awkward manners.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, stuff!&nbsp; Harry Meltham likes such manners; and so do papa's



<P>friends.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, you MAY captivate old men, and younger sons; but nobody



<P>else, I am sure, will ever take a fancy to you.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I don't care:&nbsp; I'm not always grabbing after money, like you and



<P>mamma.&nbsp; If my husband is able to keep a few good horses and dogs,

I



<P>shall be quite satisfied; and all the rest may go to the devil!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, if you use such shocking expressions, I'm sure no real



<P>gentleman will ever venture to come near you.&nbsp; Really, Miss Grey,



<P>you should not let her do so.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I can't possibly prevent it, Miss Murray.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And you're quite mistaken, Matilda, in supposing that Harry



<P>Meltham admires you:&nbsp; I assure you he does nothing of the kind.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Matilda was beginning an angry reply; but, happily, our journey was



<P>now at an end; and the contention was cut short by the footman



<P>opening the carriage-door, and letting down the steps for our



<P>descent.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>CHAPTER XI - THE COTTAGERS</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>AS I had now only one regular pupil - though she contrived to give



<P>me as much trouble as three or four ordinary ones, and though her



<P>sister still took lessons in German and drawing - I had



<P>considerably more time at my own disposal than I had ever been



<P>blessed with before, since I had taken upon me the governess's



<P>yoke; which time I devoted partly to correspondence with my



<P>friends, partly to reading, study, and the practice of music,



<P>singing, &amp;c., partly to wandering in the grounds or adjacent



<P>fields, with my pupils if they wanted me, alone if they did not.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Often, when they had no more agreeable occupation at hand, the



<P>Misses Murray would amuse themselves with visiting the poor



<P>cottagers on their father's estate, to receive their flattering



<P>homage, or to hear the old stories or gossiping news of the



<P>garrulous old women; or, perhaps, to enjoy the purer pleasure of



<P>making the poor people happy with their cheering presence and their



<P>occasional gifts, so easily bestowed, so thankfully received.



<P>Sometimes, I was called upon to accompany one or both of the



<P>sisters in these visits; and sometimes I was desired to go alone,



<P>to fulfil some promise which they had been more ready to make than



<P>to perform; to carry some small donation, or read to one who was



<P>sick or seriously disposed:&nbsp; and thus I made a few acquaintances



<P>among the cottagers; and, occasionally, I went to see them on my



<P>own account.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I generally had more satisfaction in going alone than with either



<P>of the young ladies; for they, chiefly owing to their defective



<P>education, comported themselves towards their inferiors in a manner



<P>that was highly disagreeable for me to witness.&nbsp; They never, in



<P>thought, exchanged places with them; and, consequently, had no



<P>consideration for their feelings, regarding them as an order of



<P>beings entirely different from themselves.&nbsp; They would watch the



<P>poor creatures at their meals, making uncivil remarks about their



<P>food, and their manner of eating; they would laugh at their simple



<P>notions and provincial expressions, till some of them scarcely



<P>durst venture to speak; they would call the grave elderly men and



<P>women old fools and silly old blockheads to their faces:&nbsp; and all



<P>this without meaning to offend.&nbsp; I could see that the people were



<P>often hurt and annoyed by such conduct, though their fear of the



<P>'grand ladies' prevented them from testifying any resentment; but



<P>THEY never perceived it.&nbsp; They thought that, as these cottagers



<P>were poor and untaught, they must be stupid and brutish; and as



<P>long as they, their superiors, condescended to talk to them, and to



<P>give them shillings and half-crowns, or articles of clothing, they



<P>had a right to amuse themselves, even at their expense; and the



<P>people must adore them as angels of light, condescending to



<P>minister to their necessities, and enlighten their humble



<P>dwellings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I made many and various attempts to deliver my pupils from these



<P>delusive notions without alarming their pride - which was easily



<P>offended, and not soon appeased - but with little apparent result;



<P>and I know not which was the more reprehensible of the two:



<P>Matilda was more rude and boisterous; but from Rosalie's womanly



<P>age and lady-like exterior better things were expected:&nbsp; yet she



<P>was as provokingly careless and inconsiderate as a giddy child of



<P>twelve.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One bright day in the last week of February, I was walking in the



<P>park, enjoying the threefold luxury of solitude, a book, and



<P>pleasant weather; for Miss Matilda had set out on her daily ride,



<P>and Miss Murray was gone in the carriage with her mamma to pay some



<P>morning calls.&nbsp; But it struck me that I ought to leave these



<P>selfish pleasures, and the park with its glorious canopy of bright



<P>blue sky, the west wind sounding through its yet leafless branches,



<P>the snow-wreaths still lingering in its hollows, but melting fast



<P>beneath the sun, and the graceful deer browsing on its moist



<P>herbage already assuming the freshness and verdure of spring - and



<P>go to the cottage of one Nancy Brown, a widow, whose son was at



<P>work all day in the fields, and who was afflicted with an



<P>inflammation in the eyes; which had for some time incapacitated her



<P>from reading:&nbsp; to her own great grief, for she was a woman of a



<P>serious, thoughtful turn of mind.&nbsp; I accordingly went, and found



<P>her alone, as usual, in her little, close, dark cottage, redolent



<P>of smoke and confined air, but as tidy and clean as she could make



<P>it.&nbsp; She was seated beside her little fire (consisting of a few

red



<P>cinders and a bit of stick), busily knitting, with a small



<P>sackcloth cushion at her feet, placed for the accommodation of her



<P>gentle friend the cat, who was seated thereon, with her long tail



<P>half encircling her velvet paws, and her half-closed eyes dreamily



<P>gazing on the low, crooked fender.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, Nancy, how are you to-day?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Why, middling, Miss, i' myseln - my eyes is no better, but I'm a



<P>deal easier i' my mind nor I have been,' replied she, rising to



<P>welcome me with a contented smile; which I was glad to see, for



<P>Nancy had been somewhat afflicted with religious melancholy.&nbsp; I



<P>congratulated her upon the change.&nbsp; She agreed that it was a great



<P>blessing, and expressed herself 'right down thankful for it';



<P>adding, 'If it please God to spare my sight, and make me so as I



<P>can read my Bible again, I think I shall be as happy as a queen.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I hope He will, Nancy,' replied I; 'and, meantime, I'll come and



<P>read to you now and then, when I have a little time to spare.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With expressions of grateful pleasure, the poor woman moved to get



<P>me a chair; but, as I saved her the trouble, she busied herself



<P>with stirring the fire, and adding a few more sticks to the



<P>decaying embers; and then, taking her well-used Bible from the



<P>shelf, dusted it carefully, and gave it me.&nbsp; On my asking if there



<P>was any particular part she should like me to read, she answered -

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, Miss Grey, if it's all the same to you, I should like to



<P>hear that chapter in the First Epistle of St. John, that says, "God



<P>is love, and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in



<P>him."'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With a little searching, I found these words in the fourth chapter.



<P>When I came to the seventh verse she interrupted me, and, with



<P>needless apologies for such a liberty, desired me to read it very



<P>slowly, that she might take it all in, and dwell on every word;



<P>hoping I would excuse her, as she was but a 'simple body.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'The wisest person,' I replied, 'might think over each of these



<P>verses for an hour, and be all the better for it; and I would



<P>rather read them slowly than not.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Accordingly, I finished the chapter as slowly as need be, and at



<P>the same time as impressively as I could; my auditor listened most



<P>attentively all the while, and sincerely thanked me when I had



<P>done.&nbsp; I sat still about half a minute to give her time to reflect



<P>upon it; when, somewhat to my surprise, she broke the pause by



<P>asking me how I liked Mr. Weston?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I don't know,' I replied, a little startled by the suddenness of



<P>the question; 'I think he preaches very well.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Ay, he does so; and talks well too.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Does he?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'He does.&nbsp; Maybe, you haven't seen him - not to talk to him much,



<P>yet?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No, I never see any one to talk to - except the young ladies of



<P>the Hall.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Ah; they're nice, kind young ladies; but they can't talk as he



<P>does.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Then he comes to see you, Nancy?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'He does, Miss; and I'se thankful for it.&nbsp; He comes to see all

us



<P>poor bodies a deal ofter nor Maister Bligh, or th' Rector ever did;



<P>an' it's well he does, for he's always welcome:&nbsp; we can't say as



<P>much for th' Rector - there is 'at says they're fair feared on him.



<P>When he comes into a house, they say he's sure to find summut



<P>wrong, and begin a-calling 'em as soon as he crosses th' doorstuns:



<P>but maybe he thinks it his duty like to tell 'em what's wrong.&nbsp;

And



<P>very oft he comes o' purpose to reprove folk for not coming to



<P>church, or not kneeling an' standing when other folk does, or going



<P>to the Methody chapel, or summut o' that sort:&nbsp; but I can't say

'at



<P>he ever fund much fault wi' me.&nbsp; He came to see me once or twice,



<P>afore Maister Weston come, when I was so ill troubled in my mind;



<P>and as I had only very poor health besides, I made bold to send for



<P>him - and he came right enough.&nbsp; I was sore distressed, Miss Grey

-



<P>thank God, it's owered now - but when I took my Bible, I could get



<P>no comfort of it at all.&nbsp; That very chapter 'at you've just been



<P>reading troubled me as much as aught - "He that loveth not, knoweth



<P>not God."&nbsp; It seemed fearsome to me; for I felt that I loved



<P>neither God nor man as I should do, and could not, if I tried ever



<P>so.&nbsp; And th' chapter afore, where it says, - "He that is born of



<P>God cannot commit sin."&nbsp; And another place where it says, - "Love



<P>is the fulfilling of the Law."&nbsp; And many, many others, Miss:&nbsp;

I



<P>should fair weary you out, if I was to tell them all.&nbsp; But all



<P>seemed to condemn me, and to show me 'at I was not in the right



<P>way; and as I knew not how to get into it, I sent our Bill to beg



<P>Maister Hatfield to be as kind as look in on me some day and when



<P>he came, I telled him all my troubles.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And what did he say, Nancy?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Why, Miss, he seemed to scorn me.&nbsp; I might be mista'en - but he



<P>like gave a sort of a whistle, and I saw a bit of a smile on his



<P>face; and he said, "Oh, it's all stuff!&nbsp; You've been among the



<P>Methodists, my good woman."&nbsp; But I telled him I'd never been near



<P>the Methodies.&nbsp; And then he said, - "Well," says he, "you must

come



<P>to church, where you'll hear the Scriptures properly explained,



<P>instead of sitting poring over your Bible at home."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But I telled him I always used coming to church when I had my



<P>health; but this very cold winter weather I hardly durst venture so



<P>far - and me so bad wi' th' rheumatic and all.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But he says, "It'll do your rheumatiz good to hobble to church:



<P>there's nothing like exercise for the rheumatiz.&nbsp; You can walk



<P>about the house well enough; why can't you walk to church?&nbsp; The



<P>fact is," says he, "you're getting too fond of your ease.&nbsp; It's



<P>always easy to find excuses for shirking one's duty."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But then, you know, Miss Grey, it wasn't so.&nbsp; However, I telled



<P>him I'd try.&nbsp; "But please, sir," says I, "if I do go to church,



<P>what the better shall I be?&nbsp; I want to have my sins blotted out,



<P>and to feel that they are remembered no more against me, and that



<P>the love of God is shed abroad in my heart; and if I can get no



<P>good by reading my Bible an' saying my prayers at home, what good



<P>shall I get by going to church?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'"The church," says he, "is the place appointed by God for His



<P>worship.&nbsp; It's your duty to go there as often as you can.&nbsp;

If you



<P>want comfort, you must seek it in the path of duty," - an' a deal



<P>more he said, but I cannot remember all his fine words.&nbsp; However,



<P>it all came to this, that I was to come to church as oft as ever I



<P>could, and bring my prayer-book with me, an' read up all the



<P>sponsers after the clerk, an' stand, an' kneel, an' sit, an' do all



<P>as I should, and take the Lord's Supper at every opportunity, an'



<P>hearken his sermons, and Maister Bligh's, an' it 'ud be all right:



<P>if I went on doing my duty, I should get a blessing at last.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'"But if you get no comfort that way," says he, "it's all up."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'"Then, sir," says I, "should you think I'm a reprobate?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'"Why," says he - he says, "if you do your best to get to heaven



<P>and can't manage it, you must be one of those that seek to enter in



<P>at the strait gate and shall not be able."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'An' then he asked me if I'd seen any of the ladies o' th' Hall



<P>about that mornin'; so I telled him where I had seen the young



<P>misses go on th' Moss Lane; - an' he kicked my poor cat right



<P>across th' floor, an' went after 'em as gay as a lark:&nbsp; but I was



<P>very sad.&nbsp; That last word o' his fair sunk into my heart, an' lay



<P>there like a lump o' lead, till I was weary to bear it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Howsever, I follered his advice:&nbsp; I thought he meant it all for



<P>th' best, though he HAD a queer way with him.&nbsp; But you know, Miss,



<P>he's rich an' young, and such like cannot right understand the



<P>thoughts of a poor old woman such as me.&nbsp; But, howsever, I did

my



<P>best to do all as he bade me - but maybe I'm plaguing you, Miss,



<P>wi' my chatter.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, no, Nancy!&nbsp; Go on, and tell me all.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, my rheumatiz got better - I know not whether wi' going to



<P>church or not, but one frosty Sunday I got this cold i' my eyes.



<P>Th' inflammation didn't come on all at once like, but bit by bit -



<P>but I wasn't going to tell you about my eyes, I was talking about



<P>my trouble o' mind; - and to tell the truth, Miss Grey, I don't



<P>think it was anyways eased by coming to church - nought to speak



<P>on, at least:&nbsp; I like got my health better; but that didn't mend

my



<P>soul.&nbsp; I hearkened and hearkened the ministers, and read an' read



<P>at my prayer-book; but it was all like sounding brass and a



<P>tinkling cymbal:&nbsp; the sermons I couldn't understand, an' th'



<P>prayer-book only served to show me how wicked I was, that I could



<P>read such good words an' never be no better for it, and oftens feel



<P>it a sore labour an' a heavy task beside, instead of a blessing and



<P>a privilege as all good Christians does.&nbsp; It seemed like as all



<P>were barren an' dark to me.&nbsp; And then, them dreadful words, "Many



<P>shall seek to enter in, and shall not be able."&nbsp; They like as they



<P>fair dried up my sperrit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But one Sunday, when Maister Hatfield gave out about the



<P>sacrament, I noticed where he said, "If there be any of you that



<P>cannot quiet his own conscience, but requireth further comfort or



<P>counsel, let him come to me, or some other discreet and learned



<P>minister of God's word, and open his grief!"&nbsp; So next Sunday



<P>morning, afore service, I just looked into the vestry, an' began a-



<P>talking to th' Rector again.&nbsp; I hardly could fashion to take such

a



<P>liberty, but I thought when my soul was at stake I shouldn't stick



<P>at a trifle.&nbsp; But he said he hadn't time to attend to me then.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'"And, indeed," says he, "I've nothing to say to you but what I've



<P>said before.&nbsp; Take the sacrament, of course, and go on doing your



<P>duty; and if that won't serve you, nothing will.&nbsp; So don't bother



<P>me any more."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'So then, I went away.&nbsp; But I heard Maister Weston - Maister Weston



<P>was there, Miss - this was his first Sunday at Horton, you know,



<P>an' he was i' th' vestry in his surplice, helping th' Rector on



<P>with his gown - '

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes, Nancy.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And I heard him ask Maister Hatfield who I was, an' he says, "Oh,



<P>she's a canting old fool."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And I was very ill grieved, Miss Grey; but I went to my seat, and



<P>I tried to do my duty as aforetime:&nbsp; but I like got no peace.&nbsp;

An'



<P>I even took the sacrament; but I felt as though I were eating and



<P>drinking to my own damnation all th' time.&nbsp; So I went home, sorely



<P>troubled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But next day, afore I'd gotten fettled up - for indeed, Miss, I'd



<P>no heart to sweeping an' fettling, an' washing pots; so I sat me



<P>down i' th' muck - who should come in but Maister Weston!&nbsp; I



<P>started siding stuff then, an' sweeping an' doing; and I expected



<P>he'd begin a-calling me for my idle ways, as Maister Hatfield would



<P>a' done; but I was mista'en:&nbsp; he only bid me good-mornin' like,

in



<P>a quiet dacent way.&nbsp; So I dusted him a chair, an' fettled up th'



<P>fireplace a bit; but I hadn't forgotten th' Rector's words, so says



<P>I, "I wonder, sir, you should give yourself that trouble, to come



<P>so far to see a 'canting old fool,' such as me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'He seemed taken aback at that; but he would fain persuade me 'at



<P>the Rector was only in jest; and when that wouldn't do, he says,



<P>"Well, Nancy, you shouldn't think so much about it:&nbsp; Mr. Hatfield



<P>was a little out of humour just then:&nbsp; you know we're none of us



<P>perfect - even Moses spoke unadvisedly with his lips.&nbsp; But now

sit



<P>down a minute, if you can spare the time, and tell me all your



<P>doubts and fears; and I'll try to remove them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'So I sat me down anent him.&nbsp; He was quite a stranger, you know,



<P>Miss Grey, and even YOUNGER nor Maister Hatfield, I believe; and I



<P>had thought him not so pleasant-looking as him, and rather a bit



<P>crossish, at first, to look at; but he spake so civil like - and



<P>when th' cat, poor thing, jumped on to his knee, he only stroked



<P>her, and gave a bit of a smile:&nbsp; so I thought that was a good sign;



<P>for once, when she did so to th' Rector, he knocked her off, like



<P>as it might be in scorn and anger, poor thing.&nbsp; But you can't



<P>expect a cat to know manners like a Christian, you know, Miss



<P>Grey.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No; of course not, Nancy.&nbsp; But what did Mr. Weston say then?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'He said nought; but he listened to me as steady an' patient as



<P>could be, an' never a bit o' scorn about him; so I went on, an'



<P>telled him all, just as I've telled you - an' more too.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'"Well," says he, "Mr. Hatfield was quite right in telling you to



<P>persevere in doing your duty; but in advising you to go to church



<P>and attend to the service, and so on, he didn't mean that was the



<P>whole of a Christian's duty:&nbsp; he only thought you might there learn



<P>what more was to be done, and be led to take delight in those



<P>exercises, instead of finding them a task and a burden.&nbsp; And if

you



<P>had asked him to explain those words that trouble you so much, I



<P>think he would have told you, that if many shall seek to enter in



<P>at the strait gate and shall not be able, it is their own sins that



<P>hinder them; just as a man with a large sack on his back might wish



<P>to pass through a narrow doorway, and find it impossible to do so



<P>unless he would leave his sack behind him.&nbsp; But you, Nancy, I dare



<P>say, have no sins that you would not gladly throw aside, if you



<P>knew how?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'"Indeed, sir, you speak truth," said I.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'"Well," says he, "you know the first and great commandment - and



<P>the second, which is like unto it - on which two commandments hang



<P>all the law and the prophets?&nbsp; You say you cannot love God; but

it



<P>strikes me that if you rightly consider who and what He is, you



<P>cannot help it.&nbsp; He is your father, your best friend:&nbsp; every



<P>blessing, everything good, pleasant, or useful, comes from Him; and



<P>everything evil, everything you have reason to hate, to shun, or to



<P>fear, comes from Satan - HIS enemy as well as ours.&nbsp; And for THIS



<P>cause was God manifest in the flesh, that He might destroy the



<P>works of the Devil:&nbsp; in one word, God is LOVE; and the more of

love



<P>we have within us, the nearer we are to Him and the more of His



<P>spirit we possess."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'"Well, sir," I said, "if I can always think on these things, I



<P>think I might well love God:&nbsp; but how can I love my neighbours,



<P>when they vex me, and be so contrary and sinful as some on 'em is?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'"It may seem a hard matter," says he, "to love our neighbours, who



<P>have so much of what is evil about them, and whose faults so often



<P>awaken the evil that lingers within ourselves; but remember that HE



<P>made them, and HE loves them; and whosoever loveth him that begat,



<P>loveth him that is begotten also.&nbsp; And if God so loveth us, that

He



<P>gave His only begotten Son to die for us, we ought also to love one



<P>another.&nbsp; But if you cannot feel positive affection for those who



<P>do not care for you, you can at least try to do to them as you



<P>would they should do unto you:&nbsp; you can endeavour to pity their



<P>failings and excuse their offences, and to do all the good you can



<P>to those about you.&nbsp; And if you accustom yourself to this, Nancy,



<P>the very effort itself will make you love them in some degree - to



<P>say nothing of the goodwill your kindness would beget in them,



<P>though they might have little else that is good about them.&nbsp; If

we



<P>love God and wish to serve Him, let us try to be like Him, to do



<P>His work, to labour for His glory - which is the good of man - to



<P>hasten the coming of His kingdom, which is the peace and happiness



<P>of all the world:&nbsp; however powerless we may seem to be, in doing



<P>all the good we can through life, the humblest of us may do much



<P>towards it:&nbsp; and let us dwell in love, that He may dwell in us

and



<P>we in Him.&nbsp; The more happiness we bestow, the more we shall



<P>receive, even here; and the greater will be our reward in heaven



<P>when we rest from our labours."&nbsp; I believe, Miss, them is his very



<P>words, for I've thought 'em ower many a time.&nbsp; An' then he took



<P>that Bible, an' read bits here and there, an' explained 'em as



<P>clear as the day:&nbsp; and it seemed like as a new light broke in on

my



<P>soul; an' I felt fair aglow about my heart, an' only wished poor



<P>Bill an' all the world could ha' been there, an' heard it all, and



<P>rejoiced wi' me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'After he was gone, Hannah Rogers, one o' th' neighbours, came in



<P>and wanted me to help her to wash.&nbsp; I telled her I couldn't just



<P>then, for I hadn't set on th' potaties for th' dinner, nor washed



<P>up th' breakfast stuff yet.&nbsp; So then she began a-calling me for

my



<P>nasty idle ways.&nbsp; I was a little bit vexed at first, but I never



<P>said nothing wrong to her:&nbsp; I only telled her like all in a quiet



<P>way, 'at I'd had th' new parson to see me; but I'd get done as



<P>quick as ever I could, an' then come an' help her.&nbsp; So then she



<P>softened down; and my heart like as it warmed towards her, an' in a



<P>bit we was very good friends.&nbsp; An' so it is, Miss Grey, "a soft



<P>answer turneth away wrath; but grievous words stir up anger."&nbsp;

It



<P>isn't only in them you speak to, but in yourself.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Very true, Nancy, if we could always remember it.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Ay, if we could!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And did Mr. Weston ever come to see you again?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes, many a time; and since my eyes has been so bad, he's sat an'



<P>read to me by the half-hour together:&nbsp; but you know, Miss, he has



<P>other folks to see, and other things to do - God bless him!&nbsp; An'



<P>that next Sunday he preached SUCH a sermon!&nbsp; His text was, "Come



<P>unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you



<P>rest," and them two blessed verses that follows.&nbsp; You wasn't there,



<P>Miss, you was with your friends then - but it made me SO happy!



<P>And I AM happy now, thank God! an' I take a pleasure, now, in doing



<P>little bits o' jobs for my neighbours - such as a poor old body



<P>'at's half blind can do; and they take it kindly of me, just as he



<P>said.&nbsp; You see, Miss, I'm knitting a pair o' stockings now; -



<P>they're for Thomas Jackson:&nbsp; he's a queerish old body, an' we've



<P>had many a bout at threaping, one anent t'other; an' at times we've



<P>differed sorely.&nbsp; So I thought I couldn't do better nor knit him

a



<P>pair o' warm stockings; an' I've felt to like him a deal better,



<P>poor old man, sin' I began.&nbsp; It's turned out just as Maister Weston



<P>said.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, I'm very glad to see you so happy, Nancy, and so wise:&nbsp;

but



<P>I must go now; I shall be wanted at the Hall,' said I; and bidding



<P>her good-bye, I departed, promising to come again when I had time,



<P>and feeling nearly as happy as herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At another time I went to read to a poor labourer who was in the



<P>last stage of consumption.&nbsp; The young ladies had been to see him,



<P>and somehow a promise of reading had been extracted from them; but



<P>it was too much trouble, so they begged me to do it instead.&nbsp; I



<P>went, willingly enough; and there too I was gratified with the



<P>praises of Mr. Weston, both from the sick man and his wife.&nbsp; The



<P>former told me that he derived great comfort and benefit from the



<P>visits of the new parson, who frequently came to see him, and was



<P>'another guess sort of man' to Mr. Hatfield; who, before the



<P>other's arrival at Horton, had now and then paid him a visit; on



<P>which occasions he would always insist upon having the cottage-door



<P>kept open, to admit the fresh air for his own convenience, without



<P>considering how it might injure the sufferer; and having opened his



<P>prayer-book and hastily read over a part of the Service for the



<P>Sick, would hurry away again:&nbsp; if he did not stay to administer



<P>some harsh rebuke to the afflicted wife, or to make some



<P>thoughtless, not to say heartless, observation, rather calculated



<P>to increase than diminish the troubles of the suffering pair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Whereas,' said the man, 'Maister Weston 'ull pray with me quite in



<P>a different fashion, an' talk to me as kind as owt; an' oft read to



<P>me too, an' sit beside me just like a brother.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Just for all the world!' exclaimed his wife; 'an' about a three



<P>wik sin', when he seed how poor Jem shivered wi' cold, an' what



<P>pitiful fires we kept, he axed if wer stock of coals was nearly



<P>done.&nbsp; I telled him it was, an' we was ill set to get more:&nbsp;

but



<P>you know, mum, I didn't think o' him helping us; but, howsever, he



<P>sent us a sack o' coals next day; an' we've had good fires ever



<P>sin':&nbsp; and a great blessing it is, this winter time.&nbsp; But

that's



<P>his way, Miss Grey:&nbsp; when he comes into a poor body's house a-



<P>seein' sick folk, he like notices what they most stand i' need on;



<P>an' if he thinks they can't readily get it therseln, he never says



<P>nowt about it, but just gets it for 'em.&nbsp; An' it isn't everybody



<P>'at 'ud do that, 'at has as little as he has:&nbsp; for you know, mum,



<P>he's nowt at all to live on but what he gets fra' th' Rector, an'



<P>that's little enough they say.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I remembered then, with a species of exultation, that he had



<P>frequently been styled a vulgar brute by the amiable Miss Murray,



<P>because he wore a silver watch, and clothes not quite so bright and



<P>fresh as Mr. Hatfield's.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In returning to the Lodge I felt very happy, and thanked God that I



<P>had now something to think about; something to dwell on as a relief



<P>from the weary monotony, the lonely drudgery, of my present life:



<P>for I WAS lonely.&nbsp; Never, from month to month, from year to year,



<P>except during my brief intervals of rest at home, did I see one



<P>creature to whom I could open my heart, or freely speak my thoughts



<P>with any hope of sympathy, or even comprehension:&nbsp; never one,



<P>unless it were poor Nancy Brown, with whom I could enjoy a single



<P>moment of real social intercourse, or whose conversation was



<P>calculated to render me better, wiser, or happier than before; or



<P>who, as far as I could see, could be greatly benefited by mine.&nbsp;

My



<P>only companions had been unamiable children, and ignorant, wrong-



<P>headed girls; from whose fatiguing folly, unbroken solitude was



<P>often a relief most earnestly desired and dearly prized.&nbsp; But to

be



<P>restricted to such associates was a serious evil, both in its



<P>immediate effects and the consequences that were likely to ensue.



<P>Never a new idea or stirring thought came to me from without; and



<P>such as rose within me were, for the most part, miserably crushed



<P>at once, or doomed to sicken or fade away, because they could not



<P>see the light.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Habitual associates are known to exercise a great influence over



<P>each other's minds and manners.&nbsp; Those whose actions are for ever



<P>before our eyes, whose words are ever in our ears, will naturally



<P>lead us, albeit against our will, slowly, gradually, imperceptibly,



<P>perhaps, to act and speak as they do.&nbsp; I will not presume to say



<P>how far this irresistible power of assimilation extends; but if one



<P>civilised man were doomed to pass a dozen years amid a race of



<P>intractable savages, unless he had power to improve them, I greatly



<P>question whether, at the close of that period, he would not have



<P>become, at least, a barbarian himself.&nbsp; And I, as I could not make



<P>my young companions better, feared exceedingly that they would make



<P>me worse - would gradually bring my feelings, habits, capacities,



<P>to the level of their own; without, however, imparting to me their



<P>lightheartedness and cheerful vivacity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Already, I seemed to feel my intellect deteriorating, my heart



<P>petrifying, my soul contracting; and I trembled lest my very moral



<P>perceptions should become deadened, my distinctions of right and



<P>wrong confounded, and all my better faculties be sunk, at last,



<P>beneath the baneful influence of such a mode of life.&nbsp; The gross



<P>vapours of earth were gathering around me, and closing in upon my



<P>inward heaven; and thus it was that Mr. Weston rose at length upon



<P>me, appearing like the morning star in my horizon, to save me from



<P>the fear of utter darkness; and I rejoiced that I had now a subject



<P>for contemplation that was above me, not beneath.&nbsp; I was glad to



<P>see that all the world was not made up of Bloomfields, Murrays,



<P>Hatfields, Ashbys, &amp;c.; and that human excellence was not a mere



<P>dream of the imagination.&nbsp; When we hear a little good and no harm



<P>of a person, it is easy and pleasant to imagine more:&nbsp; in short,

it



<P>is needless to analyse all my thoughts; but Sunday was now become a



<P>day of peculiar delight to me (I was now almost broken-in to the



<P>back corner in the carriage), for I liked to hear him - and I liked



<P>to see him, too; though I knew he was not handsome, or even what is



<P>called agreeable, in outward aspect; but, certainly, he was not



<P>ugly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In stature he was a little, a very little, above the middle size;



<P>the outline of his face would be pronounced too square for beauty,



<P>but to me it announced decision of character; his dark brown hair



<P>was not carefully curled, like Mr. Hatfield's, but simply brushed



<P>aside over a broad white forehead; the eyebrows, I suppose, were



<P>too projecting, but from under those dark brows there gleamed an



<P>eye of singular power, brown in colour, not large, and somewhat



<P>deep-set, but strikingly brilliant, and full of expression; there



<P>was character, too, in the mouth, something that bespoke a man of



<P>firm purpose and an habitual thinker; and when he smiled - but I



<P>will not speak of that yet, for, at the time I mention, I had never



<P>seen him smile:&nbsp; and, indeed, his general appearance did not



<P>impress me with the idea of a man given to such a relaxation, nor



<P>of such an individual as the cottagers described him.&nbsp; I had early



<P>formed my opinion of him; and, in spite of Miss Murray's



<P>objurgations:&nbsp; was fully convinced that he was a man of strong



<P>sense, firm faith, and ardent piety, but thoughtful and stern:&nbsp;

and



<P>when I found that, to his other good qualities, was added that of



<P>true benevolence and gentle, considerate kindness, the discovery,



<P>perhaps, delighted me the more, as I had not been prepared to



<P>expect it.

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>BESIDES the old lady, there was another relative of the family,



<P>whose visits were a great annoyance to me - this was 'Uncle



<P>Robson,' Mrs. Bloomfield's brother; a tall, self-sufficient fellow,



<P>with dark hair and sallow complexion like his sister, a nose that



<P>seemed to disdain the earth, and little grey eyes, frequently half-



<P>closed, with a mixture of real stupidity and affected contempt of



<P>all surrounding objects.&nbsp; He was a thick-set, strongly-built man,



<P>but he had found some means of compressing his waist into a



<P>remarkably small compass; and that, together with the unnatural



<P>stillness of his form, showed that the lofty-minded, manly Mr.



<P>Robson, the scorner of the female sex, was not above the foppery of



<P>stays.&nbsp; He seldom deigned to notice me; and, when he did, it was



<P>with a certain supercilious insolence of tone and manner that



<P>convinced me he was no gentleman:&nbsp; though it was intended to have

a



<P>contrary effect.&nbsp; But it was not for that I disliked his coming,

so



<P>much as for the harm he did the children - encouraging all their



<P>evil propensities, and undoing in a few minutes the little good it



<P>had taken me months of labour to achieve.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fanny and little Harriet he seldom condescended to notice; but Mary



<P>Ann was something of a favourite.&nbsp; He was continually encouraging



<P>her tendency to affectation (which I had done my utmost to crush),



<P>talking about her pretty face, and filling her head with all manner



<P>of conceited notions concerning her personal appearance (which I



<P>had instructed her to regard as dust in the balance compared with



<P>the cultivation of her mind and manners); and I never saw a child



<P>so susceptible of flattery as she was.&nbsp; Whatever was wrong, in



<P>either her or her brother, he would encourage by laughing at, if



<P>not by actually praising:&nbsp; people little know the injury they do

to



<P>children by laughing at their faults, and making a pleasant jest of



<P>what their true friends have endeavoured to teach them to hold in



<P>grave abhorrence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Though not a positive drunkard, Mr. Robson habitually swallowed



<P>great quantities of wine, and took with relish an occasional glass



<P>of brandy and water.&nbsp; He taught his nephew to imitate him in this



<P>to the utmost of his ability, and to believe that the more wine and



<P>spirits he could take, and the better he liked them, the more he



<P>manifested his bold, and manly spirit, and rose superior to his



<P>sisters.&nbsp; Mr. Bloomfield had not much to say against it, for his



<P>favourite beverage was gin and water; of which he took a



<P>considerable portion every day, by dint of constant sipping - and



<P>to that I chiefly attributed his dingy complexion and waspish



<P>temper.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Robson likewise encouraged Tom's propensity to persecute the



<P>lower creation, both by precept and example.&nbsp; As he frequently

came



<P>to course or shoot over his brother-in-law's grounds, he would



<P>bring his favourite dogs with him; and he treated them so brutally



<P>that, poor as I was, I would have given a sovereign any day to see



<P>one of them bite him, provided the animal could have done it with



<P>impunity.&nbsp; Sometimes, when in a very complacent mood, he would

go



<P>a-birds'-nesting with the children, a thing that irritated and



<P>annoyed me exceedingly; as, by frequent and persevering attempts, I



<P>flattered myself I had partly shown them the evil of this pastime,



<P>and hoped, in time, to bring them to some general sense of justice



<P>and humanity; but ten minutes' birds'-nesting with uncle Robson, or



<P>even a laugh from him at some relation of their former barbarities,



<P>was sufficient at once to destroy the effect of my whole elaborate



<P>course of reasoning and persuasion.&nbsp; Happily, however, during that



<P>spring, they never, but once, got anything but empty nests, or eggs



<P>- being too impatient to leave them till the birds were hatched;



<P>that once, Tom, who had been with his uncle into the neighbouring



<P>plantation, came running in high glee into the garden, with a brood



<P>of little callow nestlings in his hands.&nbsp; Mary Ann and Fanny, whom



<P>I was just bringing out, ran to admire his spoils, and to beg each



<P>a bird for themselves.&nbsp; 'No, not one!' cried Tom.&nbsp; 'They're

all



<P>mine; uncle Robson gave them to me - one, two, three, four, five -



<P>you shan't touch one of them! no, not one, for your lives!'



<P>continued he, exultingly; laying the nest on the ground, and



<P>standing over it with his legs wide apart, his hands thrust into



<P>his breeches-pockets, his body bent forward, and his face twisted



<P>into all manner of contortions in the ecstasy of his delight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But you shall see me fettle 'em off.&nbsp; My word, but I WILL wallop



<P>'em?&nbsp; See if I don't now.&nbsp; By gum! but there's rare sport

for me in



<P>that nest.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But, Tom,' said I, 'I shall not allow you to torture those birds.



<P>They must either be killed at once or carried back to the place you



<P>took them from, that the old birds may continue to feed them.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But you don't know where that is, Madam:&nbsp; it's only me and uncle



<P>Robson that knows that.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But if you don't tell me, I shall kill them myself - much as I



<P>hate it.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'You daren't.&nbsp; You daren't touch them for your life! because you



<P>know papa and mamma, and uncle Robson, would be angry.&nbsp; Ha, ha!



<P>I've caught you there, Miss!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I shall do what I think right in a case of this sort without



<P>consulting any one.&nbsp; If your papa and mamma don't happen to approve



<P>of it, I shall be sorry to offend them; but your uncle Robson's



<P>opinions, of course, are nothing to me.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So saying - urged by a sense of duty - at the risk of both making



<P>myself sick and incurring the wrath of my employers - I got a large



<P>flat stone, that had been reared up for a mouse-trap by the



<P>gardener; then, having once more vainly endeavoured to persuade the



<P>little tyrant to let the birds be carried back, I asked what he



<P>intended to do with them.&nbsp; With fiendish glee he commenced a list



<P>of torments; and while he was busied in the relation, I dropped the



<P>stone upon his intended victims and crushed them flat beneath it.



<P>Loud were the outcries, terrible the execrations, consequent upon



<P>this daring outrage; uncle Robson had been coming up the walk with



<P>his gun, and was just then pausing to kick his dog.&nbsp; Tom flew



<P>towards him, vowing he would make him kick me instead of Juno.&nbsp;

Mr.



<P>Robson leant upon his gun, and laughed excessively at the violence



<P>of his nephew's passion, and the bitter maledictions and



<P>opprobrious epithets he heaped upon me.&nbsp; 'Well, you ARE a good



<P>'un!' exclaimed he, at length, taking up his weapon and proceeding



<P>towards the house.&nbsp; 'Damme, but the lad has some spunk in him,

too.



<P>Curse me, if ever I saw a nobler little scoundrel than that.&nbsp; He's



<P>beyond petticoat government already:&nbsp; by God! he defies mother,



<P>granny, governess, and all!&nbsp; Ha, ha, ha!&nbsp; Never mind, Tom,

I'll get



<P>you another brood to-morrow.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'If you do, Mr. Robson, I shall kill them too,' said I.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Humph!' replied he, and having honoured me with a broad stare -



<P>which, contrary to his expectations, I sustained without flinching



<P>- he turned away with an air of supreme contempt, and stalked into



<P>the house.&nbsp; Tom next went to tell his mamma.&nbsp; It was not her

way to



<P>say much on any subject; but, when she next saw me, her aspect and



<P>demeanour were doubly dark and chilled.&nbsp; After some casual remark



<P>about the weather, she observed - 'I am sorry, Miss Grey, you



<P>should think it necessary to interfere with Master Bloomfield's



<P>amusements; he was very much distressed about your destroying the



<P>birds.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'When Master Bloomfield's amusements consist in injuring sentient



<P>creatures,' I answered, 'I think it my duty to interfere.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'You seemed to have forgotten,' said she, calmly, 'that the



<P>creatures were all created for our convenience.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I thought that doctrine admitted some doubt, but merely replied -



<P>'If they were, we have no right to torment them for our amusement.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I think,' said she, 'a child's amusement is scarcely to be weighed



<P>against the welfare of a soulless brute.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But, for the child's own sake, it ought not to be encouraged to



<P>have such amusements,' answered I, as meekly as I could, to make up



<P>for such unusual pertinacity.&nbsp; '"Blessed are the merciful, for

they



<P>shall obtain mercy."'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh! of course; but that refers to our conduct towards each other.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'"The merciful man shows mercy to his beast,"' I ventured to add.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I think YOU have not shown much mercy,' replied she, with a short,



<P>bitter laugh; 'killing the poor birds by wholesale in that shocking



<P>manner, and putting the dear boy to such misery for a mere whim.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I judged it prudent to say no more.&nbsp; This was the nearest approach



<P>to a quarrel I ever had with Mrs. Bloomfield; as well as the



<P>greatest number of words I ever exchanged with her at one time,



<P>since the day of my first arrival.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Mr. Robson and old Mrs. Bloomfield were not the only guests



<P>whose coming to Wellwood House annoyed me; every visitor disturbed



<P>me more or less; not so much because they neglected me (though I



<P>did feel their conduct strange and disagreeable in that respect),



<P>as because I found it impossible to keep my pupils away from them,



<P>as I was repeatedly desired to do:&nbsp; Tom must talk to them, and

Mary



<P>Ann must be noticed by them.&nbsp; Neither the one nor the other knew



<P>what it was to feel any degree of shamefacedness, or even common



<P>modesty.&nbsp; They would indecently and clamorously interrupt the



<P>conversation of their elders, tease them with the most impertinent



<P>questions, roughly collar the gentlemen, climb their knees



<P>uninvited, hang about their shoulders or rifle their pockets, pull



<P>the ladies' gowns, disorder their hair, tumble their collars, and



<P>importunately beg for their trinkets.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Bloomfield had the sense to be shocked and annoyed at all



<P>this, but she had not sense to prevent it:&nbsp; she expected me to



<P>prevent it.&nbsp; But how could I - when the guests, with their fine



<P>clothes and new faces, continually flattered and indulged them, out



<P>of complaisance to their parents - how could I, with my homely



<P>garments, every-day face, and honest words, draw them away?&nbsp; I



<P>strained every nerve to do so:&nbsp; by striving to amuse them, I



<P>endeavoured to attract them to my side; by the exertion of such



<P>authority as I possessed, and by such severity as I dared to use, I



<P>tried to deter them from tormenting the guests; and by reproaching



<P>their unmannerly conduct, to make them ashamed to repeat it.&nbsp; But



<P>they knew no shame; they scorned authority which had no terrors to



<P>back it; and as for kindness and affection, either they had no



<P>hearts, or such as they had were so strongly guarded, and so well



<P>concealed, that I, with all my efforts, had not yet discovered how



<P>to reach them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But soon my trials in this quarter came to a close - sooner than I



<P>either expected or desired; for one sweet evening towards the close



<P>of May, as I was rejoicing in the near approach of the holidays,



<P>and congratulating myself upon having made some progress with my



<P>pupils (as far as their learning went, at least, for I HAD



<P>instilled SOMETHING into their heads, and I had, at length, brought



<P>them to be a little - a very little - more rational about getting



<P>their lessons done in time to leave some space for recreation,



<P>instead of tormenting themselves and me all day long to no



<P>purpose), Mrs. Bloomfield sent for me, and calmly told me that



<P>after Midsummer my services would be no longer required.&nbsp; She



<P>assured me that my character and general conduct were



<P>unexceptionable; but the children had made so little improvement



<P>since my arrival that Mr. Bloomfield and she felt it their duty to



<P>seek some other mode of instruction.&nbsp; Though superior to most



<P>children of their years in abilities, they were decidedly behind



<P>them in attainments; their manners were uncultivated, and their



<P>tempers unruly.&nbsp; And this she attributed to a want of sufficient



<P>firmness, and diligent, persevering care on my part.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Unshaken firmness, devoted diligence, unwearied perseverance,



<P>unceasing care, were the very qualifications on which I had



<P>secretly prided myself; and by which I had hoped in time to



<P>overcome all difficulties, and obtain success at last.&nbsp; I wished

to



<P>say something in my own justification; but in attempting to speak,



<P>I felt my voice falter; and rather than testify any emotion, or



<P>suffer the tears to overflow that were already gathering in my



<P>eyes, I chose to keep silence, and bear all like a self-convicted



<P>culprit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Thus was I dismissed, and thus I sought my home.&nbsp; Alas! what would



<P>they think of me? unable, after all my boasting, to keep my place,



<P>even for a single year, as governess to three small children, whose



<P>mother was asserted by my own aunt to be a 'very nice woman.'



<P>Having been thus weighed in the balance and found wanting, I need



<P>not hope they would be willing to try me again.&nbsp; And this was an



<P>unwelcome thought; for vexed, harassed, disappointed as I had been,



<P>and greatly as I had learned to love and value my home, I was not



<P>yet weary of adventure, nor willing to relax my efforts.&nbsp; I knew



<P>that all parents were not like Mr. and Mrs. Bloomfield, and I was



<P>certain all children were not like theirs.&nbsp; The next family must

be



<P>different, and any change must be for the better.&nbsp; I had been



<P>seasoned by adversity, and tutored by experience, and I longed to



<P>redeem my lost honour in the eyes of those whose opinion was more



<P>than that of all the world to me.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>CHAPTER I - THE PARSONAGE</FONT></B>

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>ALL true histories contain instruction; though, in some, the



<P>treasure may be hard to find, and when found, so trivial in



<P>quantity, that the dry, shrivelled kernel scarcely compensates for



<P>the trouble of cracking the nut.&nbsp; Whether this be the case with

my



<P>history or not, I am hardly competent to judge.&nbsp; I sometimes think



<P>it might prove useful to some, and entertaining to others; but the



<P>world may judge for itself.&nbsp; Shielded by my own obscurity, and

by



<P>the lapse of years, and a few fictitious names, I do not fear to



<P>venture; and will candidly lay before the public what I would not



<P>disclose to the most intimate friend.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>My father was a clergyman of the north of England, who was



<P>deservedly respected by all who knew him; and, in his younger days,



<P>lived pretty comfortably on the joint income of a small incumbency



<P>and a snug little property of his own.&nbsp; My mother, who married

him



<P>against the wishes of her friends, was a squire's daughter, and a



<P>woman of spirit.&nbsp; In vain it was represented to her, that if she



<P>became the poor parson's wife, she must relinquish her carriage and



<P>her lady's-maid, and all the luxuries and elegancies of affluence;



<P>which to her were little less than the necessaries of life.&nbsp; A



<P>carriage and a lady's-maid were great conveniences; but, thank



<P>heaven, she had feet to carry her, and hands to minister to her own



<P>necessities.&nbsp; An elegant house and spacious grounds were not to

be



<P>despised; but she would rather live in a cottage with Richard Grey



<P>than in a palace with any other man in the world.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Finding arguments of no avail, her father, at length, told the



<P>lovers they might marry if they pleased; but, in so doing, his



<P>daughter would forfeit every fraction of her fortune.&nbsp; He expected



<P>this would cool the ardour of both; but he was mistaken.&nbsp; My father



<P>knew too well my mother's superior worth not to be sensible that



<P>she was a valuable fortune in herself:&nbsp; and if she would but



<P>consent to embellish his humble hearth he should be happy to take



<P>her on any terms; while she, on her part, would rather labour with



<P>her own hands than be divided from the man she loved, whose



<P>happiness it would be her joy to make, and who was already one with



<P>her in heart and soul.&nbsp; So her fortune went to swell the purse

of a



<P>wiser sister, who had married a rich nabob; and she, to the wonder



<P>and compassionate regret of all who knew her, went to bury herself



<P>in the homely village parsonage among the hills of -.&nbsp; And yet,

in



<P>spite of all this, and in spite of my mother's high spirit and my



<P>father's whims, I believe you might search all England through, and



<P>fail to find a happier couple.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Of six children, my sister Mary and myself were the only two that



<P>survived the perils of infancy and early childhood.&nbsp; I, being the



<P>younger by five or six years, was always regarded as THE child, and



<P>the pet of the family:&nbsp; father, mother, and sister, all combined

to



<P>spoil me - not by foolish indulgence, to render me fractious and



<P>ungovernable, but by ceaseless kindness, to make me too helpless



<P>and dependent - too unfit for buffeting with the cares and turmoils



<P>of life.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mary and I were brought up in the strictest seclusion.&nbsp; My mother,



<P>being at once highly accomplished, well informed, and fond of



<P>employment, took the whole charge of our education on herself, with



<P>the exception of Latin - which my father undertook to teach us - so



<P>that we never even went to school; and, as there was no society in



<P>the neighbourhood, our only intercourse with the world consisted in



<P>a stately tea-party, now and then, with the principal farmers and



<P>tradespeople of the vicinity (just to avoid being stigmatized as



<P>too proud to consort with our neighbours), and an annual visit to



<P>our paternal grandfather's; where himself, our kind grandmamma, a



<P>maiden aunt, and two or three elderly ladies and gentlemen, were



<P>the only persons we ever saw.&nbsp; Sometimes our mother would amuse

us



<P>with stories and anecdotes of her younger days, which, while they



<P>entertained us amazingly, frequently awoke - in ME, at least - a



<P>secret wish to see a little more of the world.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I thought she must have been very happy:&nbsp; but she never seemed

to



<P>regret past times.&nbsp; My father, however, whose temper was neither



<P>tranquil nor cheerful by nature, often unduly vexed himself with



<P>thinking of the sacrifices his dear wife had made for him; and



<P>troubled his head with revolving endless schemes for the



<P>augmentation of his little fortune, for her sake and ours.&nbsp; In

vain



<P>my mother assured him she was quite satisfied; and if he would but



<P>lay by a little for the children, we should all have plenty, both



<P>for time present and to come:&nbsp; but saving was not my father's



<P>forte.&nbsp; He would not run in debt (at least, my mother took good



<P>care he should not), but while he had money he must spend it:&nbsp;

he



<P>liked to see his house comfortable, and his wife and daughters well



<P>clothed, and well attended; and besides, he was charitably



<P>disposed, and liked to give to the poor, according to his means:



<P>or, as some might think, beyond them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At length, however, a kind friend suggested to him a means of



<P>doubling his private property at one stroke; and further increasing



<P>it, hereafter, to an untold amount.&nbsp; This friend was a merchant,

a



<P>man of enterprising spirit and undoubted talent, who was somewhat



<P>straitened in his mercantile pursuits for want of capital; but



<P>generously proposed to give my father a fair share of his profits,



<P>if he would only entrust him with what he could spare; and he



<P>thought he might safely promise that whatever sum the latter chose



<P>to put into his hands, it should bring him in cent. per cent.&nbsp;

The



<P>small patrimony was speedily sold, and the whole of its price was



<P>deposited in the hands of the friendly merchant; who as promptly



<P>proceeded to ship his cargo, and prepare for his voyage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>My father was delighted, so were we all, with our brightening



<P>prospects.&nbsp; For the present, it is true, we were reduced to the



<P>narrow income of the curacy; but my father seemed to think there



<P>was no necessity for scrupulously restricting our expenditure to



<P>that; so, with a standing bill at Mr. Jackson's, another at



<P>Smith's, and a third at Hobson's, we got along even more



<P>comfortably than before:&nbsp; though my mother affirmed we had better



<P>keep within bounds, for our prospects of wealth were but



<P>precarious, after all; and if my father would only trust everything



<P>to her management, he should never feel himself stinted:&nbsp; but he,



<P>for once, was incorrigible.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>What happy hours Mary and I have passed while sitting at our work



<P>by the fire, or wandering on the heath-clad hills, or idling under



<P>the weeping birch (the only considerable tree in the garden),



<P>talking of future happiness to ourselves and our parents, of what



<P>we would do, and see, and possess; with no firmer foundation for



<P>our goodly superstructure than the riches that were expected to



<P>flow in upon us from the success of the worthy merchant's



<P>speculations.&nbsp; Our father was nearly as bad as ourselves; only

that



<P>he affected not to be so much in earnest:&nbsp; expressing his bright



<P>hopes and sanguine expectations in jests and playful sallies, that



<P>always struck me as being exceedingly witty and pleasant.&nbsp; Our



<P>mother laughed with delight to see him so hopeful and happy:&nbsp; but



<P>still she feared he was setting his heart too much upon the matter;



<P>and once I heard her whisper as she left the room, 'God grant he be



<P>not disappointed!&nbsp; I know not how he would bear it.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Disappointed he was; and bitterly, too.&nbsp; It came like a thunder-



<P>clap on us all, that the vessel which contained our fortune had



<P>been wrecked, and gone to the bottom with all its stores, together



<P>with several of the crew, and the unfortunate merchant himself.&nbsp;

I



<P>was grieved for him; I was grieved for the overthrow of all our



<P>air-built castles:&nbsp; but, with the elasticity of youth, I soon



<P>recovered the shook.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Though riches had charms, poverty had no terrors for an



<P>inexperienced girl like me.&nbsp; Indeed, to say the truth, there was



<P>something exhilarating in the idea of being driven to straits, and



<P>thrown upon our own resources.&nbsp; I only wished papa, mamma, and

Mary



<P>were all of the same mind as myself; and then, instead of lamenting



<P>past calamities we might all cheerfully set to work to remedy them;



<P>and the greater the difficulties, the harder our present



<P>privations, the greater should be our cheerfulness to endure the



<P>latter, and our vigour to contend against the former.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mary did not lament, but she brooded continually over the



<P>misfortune, and sank into a state of dejection from which no effort



<P>of mine could rouse her.&nbsp; I could not possibly bring her to regard



<P>the matter on its bright side as I did:&nbsp; and indeed I was so



<P>fearful of being charged with childish frivolity, or stupid



<P>insensibility, that I carefully kept most of my bright ideas and



<P>cheering notions to myself; well knowing they could not be



<P>appreciated.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>My mother thought only of consoling my father, and paying our debts



<P>and retrenching our expenditure by every available means; but my



<P>father was completely overwhelmed by the calamity:&nbsp; health,



<P>strength, and spirits sank beneath the blow, and he never wholly



<P>recovered them.&nbsp; In vain my mother strove to cheer him, by



<P>appealing to his piety, to his courage, to his affection for



<P>herself and us.&nbsp; That very affection was his greatest torment:&nbsp;

it



<P>was for our sakes he had so ardently longed to increase his fortune



<P>- it was our interest that had lent such brightness to his hopes,



<P>and that imparted such bitterness to his present distress.&nbsp; He

now



<P>tormented himself with remorse at having neglected my mother's



<P>advice; which would at least have saved him from the additional



<P>burden of debt - he vainly reproached himself for having brought



<P>her from the dignity, the ease, the luxury of her former station to



<P>toil with him through the cares and toils of poverty.&nbsp; It was gall



<P>and wormwood to his soul to see that splendid, highly-accomplished



<P>woman, once so courted and admired, transformed into an active



<P>managing housewife, with hands and head continually occupied with



<P>household labours and household economy.&nbsp; The very willingness

with



<P>which she performed these duties, the cheerfulness with which she



<P>bore her reverses, and the kindness which withheld her from



<P>imputing the smallest blame to him, were all perverted by this



<P>ingenious self-tormentor into further aggravations of his



<P>sufferings.&nbsp; And thus the mind preyed upon the body, and disordered



<P>the system of the nerves, and they in turn increased the troubles



<P>of the mind, till by action and reaction his health was seriously



<P>impaired; and not one of us could convince him that the aspect of



<P>our affairs was not half so gloomy, so utterly hopeless, as his



<P>morbid imagination represented it to be.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The useful pony phaeton was sold, together with the stout, well-fed



<P>pony - the old favourite that we had fully determined should end



<P>its days in peace, and never pass from our hands; the little coach-



<P>house and stable were let; the servant boy, and the more efficient



<P>(being the more expensive) of the two maid-servants, were



<P>dismissed.&nbsp; Our clothes were mended, turned, and darned to the



<P>utmost verge of decency; our food, always plain, was now simplified



<P>to an unprecedented degree - except my father's favourite dishes;



<P>our coals and candles were painfully economized - the pair of



<P>candles reduced to one, and that most sparingly used; the coals



<P>carefully husbanded in the half-empty grate:&nbsp; especially when my



<P>father was out on his parish duties, or confined to bed through



<P>illness - then we sat with our feet on the fender, scraping the



<P>perishing embers together from time to time, and occasionally



<P>adding a slight scattering of the dust and fragments of coal, just



<P>to keep them alive.&nbsp; As for our carpets, they in time were worn



<P>threadbare, and patched and darned even to a greater extent than



<P>our garments.&nbsp; To save the expense of a gardener, Mary and I



<P>undertook to keep the garden in order; and all the cooking and



<P>household work that could not easily be managed by one servant-



<P>girl, was done by my mother and sister, with a little occasional



<P>help from me:&nbsp; only a little, because, though a woman in my own



<P>estimation, I was still a child in theirs; and my mother, like most



<P>active, managing women, was not gifted with very active daughters:



<P>for this reason - that being so clever and diligent herself, she



<P>was never tempted to trust her affairs to a deputy, but, on the



<P>contrary, was willing to act and think for others as well as for



<P>number one; and whatever was the business in hand, she was apt to



<P>think that no one could do it so well as herself:&nbsp; so that whenever



<P>I offered to assist her, I received such an answer as - 'No, love,



<P>you cannot indeed - there's nothing here you can do.&nbsp; Go and help



<P>your sister, or get her to take a walk with you - tell her she must



<P>not sit so much, and stay so constantly in the house as she does -



<P>she may well look thin and dejected.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Mary, mamma says I'm to help you; or get you to take a walk with



<P>me; she says you may well look thin and dejected, if you sit so



<P>constantly in the house.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Help me you cannot, Agnes; and I cannot go out with YOU - I have



<P>far too much to do.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Then let me help you.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'You cannot, indeed, dear child.&nbsp; Go and practise your music, or



<P>play with the kitten.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was always plenty of sewing on hand; but I had not been



<P>taught to cut out a single garment, and except plain hemming and



<P>seaming, there was little I could do, even in that line; for they



<P>both asserted that it was far easier to do the work themselves than



<P>to prepare it for me:&nbsp; and besides, they liked better to see me



<P>prosecuting my studies, or amusing myself - it was time enough for



<P>me to sit bending over my work, like a grave matron, when my



<P>favourite little pussy was become a steady old cat.&nbsp; Under such



<P>circumstances, although I was not many degrees more useful than the



<P>kitten, my idleness was not entirely without excuse.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Through all our troubles, I never but once heard my mother complain



<P>of our want of money.&nbsp; As summer was coming on she observed to

Mary



<P>and me, 'What a desirable thing it would be for your papa to spend



<P>a few weeks at a watering-place.&nbsp; I am convinced the sea-air and



<P>the change of scene would be of incalculable service to him.&nbsp; But



<P>then, you see, there's no money,' she added, with a sigh.&nbsp; We both



<P>wished exceedingly that the thing might be done, and lamented



<P>greatly that it could not.&nbsp; 'Well, well!' said she, 'it's no use



<P>complaining.&nbsp; Possibly something might be done to further the



<P>project after all.&nbsp; Mary, you are a beautiful drawer.&nbsp; What

do you



<P>say to doing a few more pictures in your best style, and getting



<P>them framed, with the water-coloured drawings you have already



<P>done, and trying to dispose of them to some liberal picture-dealer,



<P>who has the sense to discern their merits?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Mamma, I should be delighted if you think they COULD be sold; and



<P>for anything worth while.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'It's worth while trying, however, my dear:&nbsp; do you procure the



<P>drawings, and I'll endeavour to find a purchaser.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I wish I could do something,' said I.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'You, Agnes! well, who knows?&nbsp; You draw pretty well, too:&nbsp;

if you



<P>choose some simple piece for your subject, I daresay you will be



<P>able to produce something we shall all be proud to exhibit.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But I have another scheme in my head, mamma, and have had long,



<P>only I did not like to mention it.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Indeed! pray tell us what it is.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I should like to be a governess.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>My mother uttered an exclamation of surprise, and laughed.&nbsp; My



<P>sister dropped her work in astonishment, exclaiming, 'YOU a



<P>governess, Agnes!&nbsp; What can you be dreaming of?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well!&nbsp; I don't see anything so VERY extraordinary in it.&nbsp;

I do not



<P>pretend to be able to instruct great girls; but surely I could



<P>teach little ones:&nbsp; and I should like it so much:&nbsp; I am so

fond of



<P>children.&nbsp; Do let me, mamma!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But, my love, you have not learned to take care of YOURSELF yet:



<P>and young children require more judgment and experience to manage



<P>than elder ones.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But, mamma, I am above eighteen, and quite able to take care of



<P>myself, and others too.&nbsp; You do not know half the wisdom and



<P>prudence I possess, because I have never been tried.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Only think,' said Mary, 'what would you do in a house full of



<P>strangers, without me or mamma to speak and act for you - with a



<P>parcel of children, besides yourself, to attend to; and no one to



<P>look to for advice?&nbsp; You would not even know what clothes to put



<P>on.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'You think, because I always do as you bid me, I have no judgment



<P>of my own:&nbsp; but only try me - that is all I ask - and you shall

see



<P>what I can do.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At that moment my father entered and the subject of our discussion



<P>was explained to him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'What, my little Agnes a governess!' cried he, and, in spite of his



<P>dejection, he laughed at the idea.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes, papa, don't YOU say anything against it:&nbsp; I should like it

so



<P>much; and I am sure I could manage delightfully.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But, my darling, we could not spare you.'&nbsp; And a tear glistened

in



<P>his eye as he added - 'No, no! afflicted as we are, surely we are



<P>not brought to that pass yet.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, no!' said my mother.&nbsp; 'There is no necessity whatever for

such



<P>a step; it is merely a whim of her own.&nbsp; So you must hold your



<P>tongue, you naughty girl; for, though you are so ready to leave us,



<P>you know very well we cannot part with YOU.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I was silenced for that day, and for many succeeding ones; but



<P>still I did not wholly relinquish my darling scheme.&nbsp; Mary got

her



<P>drawing materials, and steadily set to work.&nbsp; I got mine too; but



<P>while I drew, I thought of other things.&nbsp; How delightful it would



<P>be to be a governess!&nbsp; To go out into the world; to enter upon

a



<P>new life; to act for myself; to exercise my unused faculties; to



<P>try my unknown powers; to earn my own maintenance, and something to



<P>comfort and help my father, mother, and sister, besides exonerating



<P>them from the provision of my food and clothing; to show papa what



<P>his little Agnes could do; to convince mamma and Mary that I was



<P>not quite the helpless, thoughtless being they supposed.&nbsp; And then,



<P>how charming to be entrusted with the care and education of



<P>children!&nbsp; Whatever others said, I felt I was fully competent to



<P>the task:&nbsp; the clear remembrance of my own thoughts in early



<P>childhood would be a surer guide than the instructions of the most



<P>mature adviser.&nbsp; I had but to turn from my little pupils to myself



<P>at their age, and I should know, at once, how to win their



<P>confidence and affections:&nbsp; how to waken the contrition of the



<P>erring; how to embolden the timid and console the afflicted; how to



<P>make Virtue practicable, Instruction desirable, and Religion lovely



<P>and comprehensible.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>- Delightful task!



<P>To teach the young idea how to shoot!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To train the tender plants, and watch their buds unfolding day by



<P>day!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Influenced by so many inducements, I determined still to persevere;



<P>though the fear of displeasing my mother, or distressing my



<P>father's feelings, prevented me from resuming the subject for



<P>several days.&nbsp; At length, again, I mentioned it to my mother in



<P>private; and, with some difficulty, got her to promise to assist me



<P>with her endeavours.&nbsp; My father's reluctant consent was next



<P>obtained, and then, though Mary still sighed her disapproval, my



<P>dear, kind mother began to look out for a situation for me.&nbsp; She



<P>wrote to my father's relations, and consulted the newspaper



<P>advertisements - her own relations she had long dropped all



<P>communication with:&nbsp; a formal interchange of occasional letters

was



<P>all she had ever had since her marriage, and she would not at any



<P>time have applied to them in a case of this nature.&nbsp; But so long



<P>and so entire had been my parents' seclusion from the world, that



<P>many weeks elapsed before a suitable situation could be procured.



<P>At last, to my great joy, it was decreed that I should take charge



<P>of the young family of a certain Mrs. Bloomfield; whom my kind,



<P>prim aunt Grey had known in her youth, and asserted to be a very



<P>nice woman.&nbsp; Her husband was a retired tradesman, who had realized



<P>a very comfortable fortune; but could not be prevailed upon to give



<P>a greater salary than twenty-five pounds to the instructress of his



<P>children.&nbsp; I, however, was glad to accept this, rather than refuse



<P>the situation - which my parents were inclined to think the better



<P>plan.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But some weeks more were yet to be devoted to preparation.&nbsp; How



<P>long, how tedious those weeks appeared to me!&nbsp; Yet they were happy



<P>ones in the main - full of bright hopes and ardent expectations.



<P>With what peculiar pleasure I assisted at the making of my new



<P>clothes, and, subsequently, the packing of my trunks!&nbsp; But there



<P>was a feeling of bitterness mingling with the latter occupation



<P>too; and when it was done - when all was ready for my departure on



<P>the morrow, and the last night at home approached - a sudden



<P>anguish seemed to swell my heart.&nbsp; My dear friends looked so sad,



<P>and spoke so very kindly, that I could scarcely keep my eyes from



<P>overflowing:&nbsp; but I still affected to be gay.&nbsp; I had taken

my last



<P>ramble with Mary on the moors, my last walk in the garden, and



<P>round the house; I had fed, with her, our pet pigeons for the last



<P>time - the pretty creatures that we had tamed to peck their food



<P>from our hands:&nbsp; I had given a farewell stroke to all their silky



<P>backs as they crowded in my lap.&nbsp; I had tenderly kissed my own



<P>peculiar favourites, the pair of snow-white fantails; I had played



<P>my last tune on the old familiar piano, and sung my last song to



<P>papa:&nbsp; not the last, I hoped, but the last for what appeared to

me



<P>a very long time.&nbsp; And, perhaps, when I did these things again

it



<P>would be with different feelings:&nbsp; circumstances might be changed,



<P>and this house might never be my settled home again.&nbsp; My dear



<P>little friend, the kitten, would certainly be changed:&nbsp; she was



<P>already growing a fine cat; and when I returned, even for a hasty



<P>visit at Christmas, would, most likely, have forgotten both her



<P>playmate and her merry pranks.&nbsp; I had romped with her for the last



<P>time; and when I stroked her soft bright fur, while she lay purring



<P>herself to sleep in my lap, it was with a feeling of sadness I



<P>could not easily disguise.&nbsp; Then at bed-time, when I retired with



<P>Mary to our quiet little chamber, where already my drawers were



<P>cleared out and my share of the bookcase was empty - and where,



<P>hereafter, she would have to sleep alone, in dreary solitude, as



<P>she expressed it - my heart sank more than ever:&nbsp; I felt as if

I



<P>had been selfish and wrong to persist in leaving her; and when I



<P>knelt once more beside our little bed, I prayed for a blessing on



<P>her and on my parents more fervently than ever I had done before.



<P>To conceal my emotion, I buried my face in my hands, and they were



<P>presently bathed in tears.&nbsp; I perceived, on rising, that she had



<P>been crying too:&nbsp; but neither of us spoke; and in silence we betook



<P>ourselves to our repose, creeping more closely together from the



<P>consciousness that we were to part so soon.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But the morning brought a renewal of hope and spirits.&nbsp; I was to



<P>depart early; that the conveyance which took me (a gig, hired from



<P>Mr. Smith, the draper, grocer, and tea-dealer of the village) might



<P>return the same day.&nbsp; I rose, washed, dressed, swallowed a hasty



<P>breakfast, received the fond embraces of my father, mother, and



<P>sister, kissed the cat - to the great scandal of Sally, the maid -



<P>shook hands with her, mounted the gig, drew my veil over my face,



<P>and then, but not till then, burst into a flood of tears.&nbsp; The

gig



<P>rolled on; I looked back; my dear mother and sister were still



<P>standing at the door, looking after me, and waving their adieux.&nbsp;

I



<P>returned their salute, and prayed God to bless them from my heart:



<P>we descended the hill, and I could see them no more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'It's a coldish mornin' for you, Miss Agnes,' observed Smith; 'and



<P>a darksome 'un too; but we's happen get to yon spot afore there



<P>come much rain to signify.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes, I hope so,' replied I, as calmly as I could.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'It's comed a good sup last night too.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But this cold wind will happen keep it off.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Perhaps it will.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here ended our colloquy.&nbsp; We crossed the valley, and began to



<P>ascend the opposite hill.&nbsp; As we were toiling up, I looked back



<P>again; there was the village spire, and the old grey parsonage



<P>beyond it, basking in a slanting beam of sunshine - it was but a



<P>sickly ray, but the village and surrounding hills were all in



<P>sombre shade, and I hailed the wandering beam as a propitious omen



<P>to my home.&nbsp; With clasped hands I fervently implored a blessing

on



<P>its inhabitants, and hastily turned away; for I saw the sunshine



<P>was departing; and I carefully avoided another glance, lest I



<P>should see it in gloomy shadow, like the rest of the landscape.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>'OH, dear!&nbsp; I wish Hatfield had not been so precipitate!' said



<P>Rosalie next day at four P.M., as, with a portentous yawn, she laid



<P>down her worsted-work and looked listlessly towards the window.



<P>'There's no inducement to go out now; and nothing to look forward



<P>to.&nbsp; The days will be so long and dull when there are no parties

to



<P>enliven them; and there are none this week, or next either, that I



<P>know of.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Pity you were so cross to him,' observed Matilda, to whom this



<P>lamentation was addressed.&nbsp; 'He'll never come again:&nbsp; and

I suspect



<P>you liked him after all.&nbsp; I hoped you would have taken him for

your



<P>beau, and left dear Harry to me.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Humph! my beau must be an Adonis indeed, Matilda, the admired of



<P>all beholders, if I am to be contented with him alone.&nbsp; I'm sorry



<P>to lose Hatfield, I confess; but the first decent man, or number of



<P>men, that come to supply his place, will be more than welcome.



<P>It's Sunday to-morrow - I do wonder how he'll look, and whether



<P>he'll be able to go through the service.&nbsp; Most likely he'll pretend



<P>he's got a cold, and make Mr. Weston do it all.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Not he!' exclaimed Matilda, somewhat contemptuously.&nbsp; 'Fool as

he



<P>is, he's not so soft as that comes to.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her sister was slightly offended; but the event proved Matilda was



<P>right:&nbsp; the disappointed lover performed his pastoral duties as



<P>usual.&nbsp; Rosalie, indeed, affirmed he looked very pale and dejected:



<P>he might be a little paler; but the difference, if any, was



<P>scarcely perceptible.&nbsp; As for his dejection, I certainly did not



<P>hear his laugh ringing from the vestry as usual, nor his voice loud



<P>in hilarious discourse; though I did hear it uplifted in rating the



<P>sexton in a manner that made the congregation stare; and, in his



<P>transits to and from the pulpit and the communion-table, there was



<P>more of solemn pomp, and less of that irreverent, self-confident,



<P>or rather self-delighted imperiousness with which he usually swept



<P>along - that air that seemed to say, 'You all reverence and adore



<P>me, I know; but if anyone does not, I defy him to the teeth!'&nbsp;

But



<P>the most remarkable change was, that he never once suffered his



<P>eyes to wander in the direction of Mr. Murray's pew, and did not



<P>leave the church till we were gone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Hatfield had doubtless received a very severe blow; but his



<P>pride impelled him to use every effort to conceal the effects of



<P>it.&nbsp; He had been disappointed in his certain hope of obtaining

not



<P>only a beautiful, and, to him, highly attractive wife, but one



<P>whose rank and fortune might give brilliance to far inferior



<P>charms:&nbsp; he was likewise, no doubt, intensely mortified by his



<P>repulse, and deeply offended at the conduct of Miss Murray



<P>throughout.&nbsp; It would have given him no little consolation to have



<P>known how disappointed she was to find him apparently so little



<P>moved, and to see that he was able to refrain from casting a single



<P>glance at her throughout both services; though, she declared, it



<P>showed he was thinking of her all the time, or his eyes would have



<P>fallen upon her, if it were only by chance:&nbsp; but if they had so



<P>chanced to fall, she would have affirmed it was because they could



<P>not resist the attraction.&nbsp; It might have pleased him, too, in

some



<P>degree, to have seen how dull and dissatisfied she was throughout



<P>that week (the greater part of it, at least), for lack of her usual



<P>source of excitement; and how often she regretted having 'used him



<P>up so soon,' like a child that, having devoured its plumcake too



<P>hastily, sits sucking its fingers, and vainly lamenting its



<P>greediness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At length I was called upon, one fine morning, to accompany her in



<P>a walk to the village.&nbsp; Ostensibly she went to get some shades

of



<P>Berlin wool, at a tolerably respectable shop that was chiefly



<P>supported by the ladies of the vicinity:&nbsp; really - I trust there

is



<P>no breach of charity in supposing that she went with the idea of



<P>meeting either with the Rector himself, or some other admirer by



<P>the way; for as we went along, she kept wondering 'what Hatfield



<P>would do or say, if we met him,' &amp;c. &amp;c.; as we passed Mr. Green's



<P>park-gates, she 'wondered whether he was at home - great stupid



<P>blockhead'; as Lady Meltham's carriage passed us, she 'wondered



<P>what Mr. Harry was doing this fine day'; and then began to abuse



<P>his elder brother for being 'such a fool as to get married and go



<P>and live in London.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Why,' said I, 'I thought you wanted to live in London yourself.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes, because it's so dull here:&nbsp; but then he makes it still duller



<P>by taking himself off:&nbsp; and if he were not married I might have

him



<P>instead of that odious Sir Thomas.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then, observing the prints of a horse's feet on the somewhat miry



<P>road, she 'wondered whether it was a gentleman's horse,' and



<P>finally concluded it was, for the impressions were too small to



<P>have been made by a 'great clumsy cart-horse'; and then she



<P>'wondered who the rider could be,' and whether we should meet him



<P>coming back, for she was sure he had only passed that morning; and



<P>lastly, when we entered the village and saw only a few of its



<P>humble inhabitants moving about, she 'wondered why the stupid



<P>people couldn't keep in their houses; she was sure she didn't want



<P>to see their ugly faces, and dirty, vulgar clothes - it wasn't for



<P>that she came to Horton!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amid all this, I confess, I wondered, too, in secret, whether we



<P>should meet, or catch a glimpse of somebody else; and as we passed



<P>his lodgings, I even went so far as to wonder whether he was at the



<P>window.&nbsp; On entering the shop, Miss Murray desired me to stand

in



<P>the doorway while she transacted her business, and tell her if



<P>anyone passed.&nbsp; But alas! there was no one visible besides the



<P>villagers, except Jane and Susan Green coming down the single



<P>street, apparently returning from a walk.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Stupid things!' muttered she, as she came out after having



<P>concluded her bargain.&nbsp; 'Why couldn't they have their dolt of a



<P>brother with them? even he would be better than nothing.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She greeted them, however, with a cheerful smile, and protestations



<P>of pleasure at the happy meeting equal to their own.&nbsp; They placed



<P>themselves one on each side of her, and all three walked away



<P>chatting and laughing as young ladies do when they get together, if



<P>they be but on tolerably intimate terms.&nbsp; But I, feeling myself

to



<P>be one too many, left them to their merriment and lagged behind, as



<P>usual on such occasions:&nbsp; I had no relish for walking beside Miss



<P>Green or Miss Susan like one deaf and dumb, who could neither speak



<P>nor be spoken to.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But this time I was not long alone.&nbsp; It struck me, first, as very



<P>odd, that just as I was thinking about Mr. Weston he should come up



<P>and accost me; but afterwards, on due reflection, I thought there



<P>was nothing odd about it, unless it were the fact of his speaking



<P>to me; for on such a morning and so near his own abode, it was



<P>natural enough that he should be about; and as for my thinking of



<P>him, I had been doing that, with little intermission, ever since we



<P>set out on our journey; so there was nothing remarkable in that.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'You are alone again, Miss Grey,' said he.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'What kind of people are those ladies - the Misses Green?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I really don't know.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'That's strange - when you live so near and see them so often!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, I suppose they are lively, good-tempered girls; but I



<P>imagine you must know them better than I do, yourself, for I never



<P>exchanged a word with either of them.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Indeed?&nbsp; They don't strike me as being particularly reserved.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Very likely they are not so to people of their own class; but they



<P>consider themselves as moving in quite a different sphere from me!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He made no reply to this:&nbsp; but after a short pause, he said, -

'I



<P>suppose it's these things, Miss Grey, that make you think you could



<P>not live without a home?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Not exactly.&nbsp; The fact is I am too socially disposed to be able

to



<P>live contentedly without a friend; and as the only friends I have,



<P>or am likely to have, are at home, if it - or rather, if they were



<P>gone - I will not say I could not live - but I would rather not



<P>live in such a desolate world.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But why do you say the only friends you are likely to have?&nbsp; Are



<P>you so unsociable that you cannot make friends?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No, but I never made one yet; and in my present position there is



<P>no possibility of doing so, or even of forming a common



<P>acquaintance.&nbsp; The fault may be partly in myself, but I hope not



<P>altogether.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'The fault is partly in society, and partly, I should think, in



<P>your immediate neighbours:&nbsp; and partly, too, in yourself; for many



<P>ladies, in your position, would make themselves be noticed and



<P>accounted of.&nbsp; But your pupils should be companions for you in

some



<P>degree; they cannot be many years younger than yourself.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, yes, they are good company sometimes; but I cannot call them



<P>friends, nor would they think of bestowing such a name on me - they



<P>have other companions better suited to their tastes.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Perhaps you are too wise for them.&nbsp; How do you amuse yourself

when



<P>alone - do you read much?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Reading is my favourite occupation, when I have leisure for it and



<P>books to read.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>From speaking of books in general, he passed to different books in



<P>particular, and proceeded by rapid transitions from topic to topic,



<P>till several matters, both of taste and opinion, had been discussed



<P>considerably within the space of half an hour, but without the



<P>embellishment of many observations from himself; he being evidently



<P>less bent upon communicating his own thoughts and predilections,



<P>than on discovering mine.&nbsp; He had not the tact, or the art, to



<P>effect such a purpose by skilfully drawing out my sentiments or



<P>ideas through the real or apparent statement of his own, or leading



<P>the conversation by imperceptible gradations to such topics as he



<P>wished to advert to:&nbsp; but such gentle abruptness, and such single-



<P>minded straightforwardness, could not possibly offend me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And why should he interest himself at all in my moral and



<P>intellectual capacities:&nbsp; what is it to him what I think or feel?'



<P>I asked myself.&nbsp; And my heart throbbed in answer to the question.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Jane and Susan Green soon reached their home.&nbsp; As they stood



<P>parleying at the park-gates, attempting to persuade Miss Murray to



<P>come in, I wished Mr. Weston would go, that she might not see him



<P>with me when she turned round; but, unfortunately, his business,



<P>which was to pay one more visit to poor Mark Wood, led him to



<P>pursue the same path as we did, till nearly the close of our



<P>journey.&nbsp; When, however, he saw that Rosalie had taken leave of

her



<P>friends and I was about to join her, he would have left me and



<P>passed on at a quicker pace; but, as he civilly lifted his hat in



<P>passing her, to my surprise, instead of returning the salute with a



<P>stiff, ungracious bow, she accosted him with one of her sweetest



<P>smiles, and, walking by his side, began to talk to him with all



<P>imaginable cheerfulness and affability; and so we proceeded all



<P>three together.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a short pause in the conversation, Mr. Weston made some



<P>remark addressed particularly to me, as referring to something we



<P>had been talking of before; but before I could answer, Miss Murray



<P>replied to the observation and enlarged upon it:&nbsp; he rejoined;

and,



<P>from thence to the close of the interview, she engrossed him



<P>entirely to herself.&nbsp; It might be partly owing to my own stupidity,



<P>my want of tact and assurance:&nbsp; but I felt myself wronged:&nbsp;

I



<P>trembled with apprehension; and I listened with envy to her easy,



<P>rapid flow of utterance, and saw with anxiety the bright smile with



<P>which she looked into his face from time to time:&nbsp; for she was



<P>walking a little in advance, for the purpose (as I judged) of being



<P>seen as well as heard.&nbsp; If her conversation was light and trivial,



<P>it was amusing, and she was never at a loss for something to say,



<P>or for suitable words to express it in.&nbsp; There was nothing pert

or



<P>flippant in her manner now, as when she walked with Mr. Hatfield,



<P>there was only a gentle, playful kind of vivacity, which I thought



<P>must be peculiarly pleasing to a man of Mr. Weston's disposition



<P>and temperament.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When he was gone she began to laugh, and muttered to herself, 'I



<P>thought I could do it!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Do what?' I asked.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Fix that man.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'What in the world do you mean?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I mean that he will go home and dream of me.&nbsp; I have shot him



<P>through the heart!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'How do you know?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'By many infallible proofs:&nbsp; more especially the look he gave me



<P>when he went away.&nbsp; It was not an impudent look - I exonerate him



<P>from that - it was a look of reverential, tender adoration.&nbsp; Ha,



<P>ha! he's not quite such a stupid blockhead as I thought him!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I made no answer, for my heart was in my throat, or something like



<P>it, and I could not trust myself to speak.&nbsp; 'O God, avert it!'

I



<P>cried, internally - 'for his sake, not for mine!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Murray made several trivial observations as we passed up the



<P>park, to which (in spite of my reluctance to let one glimpse of my



<P>feelings appear) I could only answer by monosyllables.&nbsp; Whether

she



<P>intended to torment me, or merely to amuse herself, I could not



<P>tell - and did not much care; but I thought of the poor man and his



<P>one lamb, and the rich man with his thousand flocks; and I dreaded



<P>I knew not what for Mr. Weston, independently of my own blighted



<P>hopes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Right glad was I to get into the house, and find myself alone once



<P>more in my own room.&nbsp; My first impulse was to sink into the chair



<P>beside the bed; and laying my head on the pillow, to seek relief in



<P>a passionate burst of tears:&nbsp; there was an imperative craving for



<P>such an indulgence; but, alas! I must restrain and swallow back my



<P>feelings still:&nbsp; there was the bell - the odious bell for the



<P>schoolroom dinner; and I must go down with a calm face, and smile,



<P>and laugh, and talk nonsense - yes, and eat, too, if possible, as



<P>if all was right, and I was just returned from a pleasant walk.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>THE following day was as fine as the preceding one.&nbsp; Soon after



<P>breakfast Miss Matilda, having galloped and blundered through a few



<P>unprofitable lessons, and vengeably thumped the piano for an hour,



<P>in a terrible humour with both me and it, because her mamma would



<P>not give her a holiday, had betaken herself to her favourite places



<P>of resort, the yards, the stables, and the dog-kennels; and Miss



<P>Murray was gone forth to enjoy a quiet ramble with a new



<P>fashionable novel for her companion, leaving me in the schoolroom



<P>hard at work upon a water-colour drawing which I had promised to do



<P>for her, and which she insisted upon my finishing that day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At my feet lay a little rough terrier.&nbsp; It was the property of

Miss



<P>Matilda; but she hated the animal, and intended to sell it,



<P>alleging that it was quite spoiled.&nbsp; It was really an excellent

dog



<P>of its kind; but she affirmed it was fit for nothing, and had not



<P>even the sense to know its own mistress.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The fact was she had purchased it when but a small puppy, insisting



<P>at first that no one should touch it but herself; but soon becoming



<P>tired of so helpless and troublesome a nursling, she had gladly



<P>yielded to my entreaties to be allowed to take charge of it; and I,



<P>by carefully nursing the little creature from infancy to



<P>adolescence, of course, had obtained its affections:&nbsp; a reward

I



<P>should have greatly valued, and looked upon as far outweighing all



<P>the trouble I had had with it, had not poor Snap's grateful



<P>feelings exposed him to many a harsh word and many a spiteful kick



<P>and pinch from his owner, and were he not now in danger of being



<P>'put away' in consequence, or transferred to some rough, stony-



<P>hearted master.&nbsp; But how could I help it?&nbsp; I could not make

the dog



<P>hate me by cruel treatment, and she would not propitiate him by



<P>kindness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>However, while I thus sat, working away with my pencil, Mrs. Murray



<P>came, half-sailing, half-bustling, into the room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Miss Grey,' she began, - 'dear! how can you sit at your drawing



<P>such a day as this?'&nbsp; (She thought I was doing it for my own



<P>pleasure.)&nbsp; 'I WONDER you don't put on your bonnet and go out with



<P>the young ladies.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I think, ma'am, Miss Murray is reading; and Miss Matilda is



<P>amusing herself with her dogs.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'If you would try to amuse Miss Matilda yourself a little more, I



<P>think she would not be driven to seek amusement in the



<P>companionship of dogs and horses and grooms, so much as she is; and



<P>if you would be a little more cheerful and conversable with Miss



<P>Murray, she would not so often go wandering in the fields with a



<P>book in her hand.&nbsp; However, I don't want to vex you,' added she,



<P>seeing, I suppose, that my cheeks burned and my hand trembled with



<P>some unamiable emotion.&nbsp; 'Do, pray, try not to be so touchy -



<P>there's no speaking to you else.&nbsp; And tell me if you know where



<P>Rosalie is gone:&nbsp; and why she likes to be so much alone?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'She says she likes to be alone when she has a new book to read.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But why can't she read it in the park or the garden? - why should



<P>she go into the fields and lanes?&nbsp; And how is it that that Mr.



<P>Hatfield so often finds her out?&nbsp; She told me last week he'd walked



<P>his horse by her side all up Moss Lane; and now I'm sure it was he



<P>I saw, from my dressing-room window, walking so briskly past the



<P>park-gates, and on towards the field where she so frequently goes.



<P>I wish you would go and see if she is there; and just gently remind



<P>her that it is not proper for a young lady of her rank and



<P>prospects to be wandering about by herself in that manner, exposed



<P>to the attentions of anyone that presumes to address her; like some



<P>poor neglected girl that has no park to walk in, and no friends to



<P>take care of her:&nbsp; and tell her that her papa would be extremely



<P>angry if he knew of her treating Mr. Hatfield in the familiar



<P>manner that I fear she does; and - oh! if you - if ANY governess



<P>had but half a mother's watchfulness - half a mother's anxious



<P>care, I should be saved this trouble; and you would see at once the



<P>necessity of keeping your eye upon her, and making your company



<P>agreeable to -&nbsp; Well, go - go; there's no time to be lost,' cried



<P>she, seeing that I had put away my drawing materials, and was



<P>waiting in the doorway for the conclusion of her address.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>According to her prognostications, I found Miss Murray in her



<P>favourite field just without the park; and, unfortunately, not



<P>alone; for the tall, stately figure of Mr. Hatfield was slowly



<P>sauntering by her side.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here was a poser for me.&nbsp; It was my duty to interrupt the TETE-A-



<P>TETE:&nbsp; but how was it to be done?&nbsp; Mr. Hatfield could not

to be



<P>driven away by so insignificant person as I; and to go and place



<P>myself on the other side of Miss Murray, and intrude my unwelcome



<P>presence upon her without noticing her companion, was a piece of



<P>rudeness I could not be guilty of:&nbsp; neither had I the courage to



<P>cry aloud from the top of the field that she was wanted elsewhere.



<P>So I took the intermediate course of walking slowly but steadily



<P>towards them; resolving, if my approach failed to scare away the



<P>beau, to pass by and tell Miss Murray her mamma wanted her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She certainly looked very charming as she strolled, lingering along



<P>under the budding horse-chestnut trees that stretched their long



<P>arms over the park-palings; with her closed book in one hand, and



<P>in the other a graceful sprig of myrtle, which served her as a very



<P>pretty plaything; her bright ringlets escaping profusely from her



<P>little bonnet, and gently stirred by the breeze, her fair cheek



<P>flushed with gratified vanity, her smiling blue eyes, now slyly



<P>glancing towards her admirer, now gazing downward at her myrtle



<P>sprig.&nbsp; But Snap, running before me, interrupted her in the midst



<P>of some half-pert, half-playful repartee, by catching hold of her



<P>dress and vehemently tugging thereat; till Mr. Hatfield, with his



<P>cane, administered a resounding thwack upon the animal's skull, and



<P>sent it yelping back to me with a clamorous outcry that afforded



<P>the reverend gentleman great amusement:&nbsp; but seeing me so near,

he



<P>thought, I suppose, he might as well be taking his departure; and,



<P>as I stooped to caress the dog, with ostentatious pity to show my



<P>disapproval of his severity, I heard him say:&nbsp; 'When shall I see



<P>you again, Miss Murray?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'At church, I suppose,' replied she, 'unless your business chances



<P>to bring you here again at the precise moment when I happen to be



<P>walking by.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I could always manage to have business here, if I knew precisely



<P>when and where to find you.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But if I would, I could not inform you, for I am so immethodical,



<P>I never can tell to-day what I shall do tomorrow.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Then give me that, meantime, to comfort me,' said he, half



<P>jestingly and half in earnest, extending his hand for the sprig of



<P>myrtle.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No, indeed, I shan't.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Do! PRAY do!&nbsp; I shall be the most miserable of men if you don't.



<P>You cannot be so cruel as to deny me a favour so easily granted and



<P>yet so highly prized!' pleaded he as ardently as if his life



<P>depended on it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>By this time I stood within a very few yards of them, impatiently



<P>waiting his departure.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'There then! take it and go,' said Rosalie.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He joyfully received the gift, murmured something that made her



<P>blush and toss her head, but with a little laugh that showed her



<P>displeasure was entirely affected; and then with a courteous



<P>salutation withdrew.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Did you ever see such a man, Miss Grey?' said she, turning to me;



<P>'I'm so GLAD you came!&nbsp; I thought I never SHOULD, get rid of him;



<P>and I was so terribly afraid of papa seeing him.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Has he been with you long?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No, not long, but he's so extremely impertinent:&nbsp; and he's always



<P>hanging about, pretending his business or his clerical duties



<P>require his attendance in these parts, and really watching for poor



<P>me, and pouncing upon me wherever he sees me.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, your mamma thinks you ought not to go beyond the park or



<P>garden without some discreet, matronly person like me to accompany



<P>you, and keep off all intruders.&nbsp; She descried Mr. Hatfield



<P>hurrying past the park-gates, and forthwith despatched me with



<P>instructions to seek you up and to take care of you, and likewise



<P>to warn - '

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, mamma's so tiresome!&nbsp; As if I couldn't take care of myself.



<P>She bothered me before about Mr. Hatfield; and I told her she might



<P>trust me:&nbsp; I never should forget my rank and station for the most



<P>delightful man that ever breathed.&nbsp; I wish he would go down on

his



<P>knees to-morrow, and implore me to be his wife, that I might just



<P>show her how mistaken she is in supposing that I could ever - Oh,



<P>it provokes me so!&nbsp; To think that I could be such a fool as to

fall



<P>in LOVE!&nbsp; It is quite beneath the dignity of a woman to do such

a



<P>thing.&nbsp; Love!&nbsp; I detest the word!&nbsp; As applied to one

of our sex, I



<P>think it a perfect insult.&nbsp; A preference I MIGHT acknowledge; but



<P>never for one like poor Mr. Hatfield, who has not seven hundred a



<P>year to bless himself with.&nbsp; I like to talk to him, because he's

so



<P>clever and amusing - I wish Sir Thomas Ashby were half as nice;



<P>besides, I must have SOMEBODY to flirt with, and no one else has



<P>the sense to come here; and when we go out, mamma won't let me



<P>flirt with anybody but Sir Thomas - if he's there; and if he's NOT



<P>there, I'm bound hand and foot, for fear somebody should go and



<P>make up some exaggerated story, and put it into his head that I'm



<P>engaged, or likely to be engaged, to somebody else; or, what is



<P>more probable, for fear his nasty old mother should see or hear of



<P>my ongoings, and conclude that I'm not a fit wife for her excellent



<P>son:&nbsp; as if the said son were not the greatest scamp in



<P>Christendom; and as if any woman of common decency were not a world



<P>too good for him.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Is it really so, Miss Murray? and does your mamma know it, and yet



<P>wish you to marry him?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'To be sure, she does!&nbsp; She knows more against him than I do, I



<P>believe:&nbsp; she keeps it from me lest I should be discouraged; not



<P>knowing how little I care about such things.&nbsp; For it's no great



<P>matter, really:&nbsp; he'll be all right when he's married, as mamma



<P>says; and reformed rakes make the best husbands, EVERYBODY knows.



<P>I only wish he were not so ugly - THAT'S all I think about:&nbsp; but



<P>then there's no choice here in the country; and papa WILL NOT let



<P>us go to London - '

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But I should think Mr. Hatfield would be far better.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And so he would, if he were lord of Ashby Park - there's not a



<P>doubt of it:&nbsp; but the fact is, I MUST have Ashby Park, whoever



<P>shares it with me.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But Mr. Hatfield thinks you like him all this time; you don't



<P>consider how bitterly he will be disappointed when he finds himself



<P>mistaken.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'NO, indeed!&nbsp; It will be a proper punishment for his presumption

-



<P>for ever DARING to think I could like him.&nbsp; I should enjoy nothing



<P>so much as lifting the veil from his eyes.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'The sooner you do it the better then.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No; I tell you, I like to amuse myself with him.&nbsp; Besides, he



<P>doesn't really think I like him.&nbsp; I take good care of that:&nbsp;

you



<P>don't know how cleverly I manage.&nbsp; He may presume to think he can



<P>induce me to like him; for which I shall punish him as he



<P>deserves.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, mind you don't give too much reason for such presumption -



<P>that's all,' replied I.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But all my exhortations were in vain:&nbsp; they only made her somewhat



<P>more solicitous to disguise her wishes and her thoughts from me.



<P>She talked no more to me about the Rector; but I could see that her



<P>mind, if not her heart, was fixed upon him still, and that she was



<P>intent upon obtaining another interview:&nbsp; for though, in compliance



<P>with her mother's request, I was now constituted the companion of



<P>her rambles for a time, she still persisted in wandering in the



<P>fields and lanes that lay in the nearest proximity to the road;



<P>and, whether she talked to me or read the book she carried in her



<P>hand, she kept continually pausing to look round her, or gaze up



<P>the road to see if anyone was coming; and if a horseman trotted by,



<P>I could tell by her unqualified abuse of the poor equestrian,



<P>whoever he might be, that she hated him BECAUSE he was not Mr.



<P>Hatfield.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Surely,' thought I, 'she is not so indifferent to him as she



<P>believes herself to be, or would have others to believe her; and



<P>her mother's anxiety is not so wholly causeless as she affirms.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Three days passed away, and he did not make his appearance.&nbsp; On

the



<P>afternoon of the fourth, as we were walking beside the park-palings



<P>in the memorable field, each furnished with a book (for I always



<P>took care to provide myself with something to be doing when she did



<P>not require me to talk), she suddenly interrupted my studies by



<P>exclaiming -

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, Miss Grey! do be so kind as to go and see Mark Wood, and take



<P>his wife half-a-crown from me - I should have given or sent it a



<P>week ago, but quite forgot.&nbsp; There!' said she, throwing me her



<P>purse, and speaking very fast - 'Never mind getting it out now, but



<P>take the purse and give them what you like; I would go with you,



<P>but I want to finish this volume.&nbsp; I'll come and meet you when

I've



<P>done it.&nbsp; Be quick, will you - and - oh, wait; hadn't you better



<P>read to him a bit?&nbsp; Run to the house and get some sort of a good



<P>book.&nbsp; Anything will do.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I did as I was desired; but, suspecting something from her hurried



<P>manner and the suddenness of the request, I just glanced back



<P>before I quitted the field, and there was Mr. Hatfield about to



<P>enter at the gate below.&nbsp; By sending me to the house for a book,



<P>she had just prevented my meeting him on the road.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Never mind!' thought I, 'there'll be no great harm done.&nbsp; Poor



<P>Mark will be glad of the half-crown, and perhaps of the good book



<P>too; and if the Rector does steal Miss Rosalie's heart, it will



<P>only humble her pride a little; and if they do get married at last,



<P>it will only save her from a worse fate; and she will be quite a



<P>good enough partner for him, and he for her.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mark Wood was the consumptive labourer whom I mentioned before.&nbsp;

He



<P>was now rapidly wearing away.&nbsp; Miss Murray, by her liberality,



<P>obtained literally the blessing of him that was ready to perish;



<P>for though the half-crown could be of very little service to him,



<P>he was glad of it for the sake of his wife and children, so soon to



<P>be widowed and fatherless.&nbsp; After I had sat a few minutes, and

read



<P>a little for the comfort and edification of himself and his



<P>afflicted wife, I left them; but I had not proceeded fifty yards



<P>before I encountered Mr. Weston, apparently on his way to the same



<P>abode.&nbsp; He greeted me in his usual quiet, unaffected way, stopped



<P>to inquire about the condition of the sick man and his family, and



<P>with a sort of unconscious, brotherly disregard to ceremony took



<P>from my hand the book out of which I had been reading, turned over



<P>its pages, made a few brief but very sensible remarks, and restored



<P>it; then told me about some poor sufferer he had just been



<P>visiting, talked a little about Nancy Brown, made a few



<P>observations upon my little rough friend the terrier, that was



<P>frisking at his feet, and finally upon the beauty of the weather,



<P>and departed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I have omitted to give a detail of his words, from a notion that



<P>they would not interest the reader as they did me, and not because



<P>I have forgotten them.&nbsp; No; I remember them well; for I thought



<P>them over and over again in the course of that day and many



<P>succeeding ones, I know not how often; and recalled every



<P>intonation of his deep, clear voice, every flash of his quick,



<P>brown eye, and every gleam of his pleasant, but too transient



<P>smile.&nbsp; Such a confession will look very absurd, I fear:&nbsp;

but no



<P>matter:&nbsp; I have written it:&nbsp; and they that read it will not

know



<P>the writer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While I was walking along, happy within, and pleased with all



<P>around, Miss Murray came hastening to meet me; her buoyant step,



<P>flushed cheek, and radiant smiles showing that she, too, was happy,



<P>in her own way.&nbsp; Running up to me, she put her arm through mine,



<P>and without waiting to recover breath, began - 'Now, Miss Grey,



<P>think yourself highly honoured, for I'm come to tell you my news



<P>before I've breathed a word of it to anyone else.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, what is it?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, SUCH news!&nbsp; In the first place, you must know that Mr.



<P>Hatfield came upon me just after you were gone.&nbsp; I was in such

a



<P>way for fear papa or mamma should see him; but you know I couldn't



<P>call you back again, and so! - oh, dear!&nbsp; I can't tell you all



<P>about it now, for there's Matilda, I see, in the park, and I must



<P>go and open my budget to her.&nbsp; But, however, Hatfield was most



<P>uncommonly audacious, unspeakably complimentary, and



<P>unprecedentedly tender - tried to be so, at least - he didn't



<P>succeed very well in THAT, because it's not his vein.&nbsp; I'll tell



<P>you all he said another time.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But what did YOU say - I'm more interested in that?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I'll tell you that, too, at some future period.&nbsp; I happened to

be



<P>in a very good humour just then; but, though I was complaisant and



<P>gracious enough, I took care not to compromise myself in any



<P>possible way.&nbsp; But, however, the conceited wretch chose to



<P>interpret my amiability of temper his own way, and at length



<P>presumed upon my indulgence so far - what do you think? - he



<P>actually made me an offer!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And you - '

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I proudly drew myself up, and with the greatest coolness expressed



<P>my astonishment at such an occurrence, and hoped he had seen



<P>nothing in my conduct to justify his expectations.&nbsp; You should

have



<P>SEEN how his countenance fell!&nbsp; He went perfectly white in the



<P>face.&nbsp; I assured him that I esteemed him and all that, but could



<P>not possibly accede to his proposals; and if I did, papa and mamma



<P>could never be brought to give their consent.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'"But if they could," said he, "would yours be wanting?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'"Certainly, Mr. Hatfield," I replied, with a cool decision which



<P>quelled all hope at once.&nbsp; Oh, if you had seen how dreadfully



<P>mortified he was - how crushed to the earth by his disappointment!



<P>really, I almost pitied him myself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'One more desperate attempt, however, he made.&nbsp; After a silence

of



<P>considerable duration, during which he struggled to be calm, and I



<P>to be grave - for I felt a strong propensity to laugh - which would



<P>have ruined all - he said, with the ghost of a smile - "But tell me



<P>plainly, Miss Murray, if I had the wealth of Sir Hugh Meltham, or



<P>the prospects of his eldest son, would you still refuse me?&nbsp; Answer



<P>me truly, upon your honour."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'"Certainly," said I.&nbsp; "That would make no difference whatever."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'It was a great lie, but he looked so confident in his own



<P>attractions still, that I determined not to leave him one stone



<P>upon another.&nbsp; He looked me full in the face; but I kept my



<P>countenance so well that he could not imagine I was saying anything



<P>more than the actual truth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'"Then it's all over, I suppose," he said, looking as if he could



<P>have died on the spot with vexation and the intensity of his



<P>despair.&nbsp; But he was angry as well as disappointed.&nbsp; There

was he,



<P>suffering so unspeakably, and there was I, the pitiless cause of it



<P>all, so utterly impenetrable to all the artillery of his looks and



<P>words, so calmly cold and proud, he could not but feel some



<P>resentment; and with singular bitterness he began - "I certainly



<P>did not expect this, Miss Murray.&nbsp; I might say something about

your



<P>past conduct, and the hopes you have led me to foster, but I



<P>forbear, on condition - "

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'"No conditions, Mr. Hatfield!" said I, now truly indignant at his



<P>insolence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'"Then let me beg it as a favour," he replied, lowering his voice



<P>at once, and taking a humbler tone:&nbsp; "let me entreat that you will



<P>not mention this affair to anyone whatever.&nbsp; If you will keep



<P>silence about it, there need be no unpleasantness on either side -



<P>nothing, I mean, beyond what is quite unavoidable:&nbsp; for my own



<P>feelings I will endeavour to keep to myself, if I cannot annihilate



<P>them - I will try to forgive, if I cannot forget the cause of my



<P>sufferings.&nbsp; I will not suppose, Miss Murray, that you know how



<P>deeply you have injured me.&nbsp; I would not have you aware of it;

but



<P>if, in addition to the injury you have already done me - pardon me,



<P>but, whether innocently or not, you HAVE done it - and if you add



<P>to it by giving publicity to this unfortunate affair, or naming it



<P>AT ALL, you will find that I too can speak, and though you scorned



<P>my love, you will hardly scorn my - "

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'He stopped, but he bit his bloodless lip, and looked so terribly



<P>fierce that I was quite frightened.&nbsp; However, my pride upheld me



<P>still, and I answered disdainfully; "I do not know what motive you



<P>suppose I could have for naming it to anyone, Mr. Hatfield; but if



<P>I were disposed to do so, you would not deter me by threats; and it



<P>is scarcely the part of a gentleman to attempt it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'"Pardon me, Miss Murray," said he, "I have loved you so intensely



<P>- I do still adore you so deeply, that I would not willingly offend



<P>you; but though I never have loved, and never CAN love any woman as



<P>I have loved you, it is equally certain that I never was so ill-



<P>treated by any.&nbsp; On the contrary, I have always found your sex

the



<P>kindest and most tender and obliging of God's creation, till now."



<P>(Think of the conceited fellow saying that!)&nbsp; "And the novelty

and



<P>harshness of the lesson you have taught me to-day, and the



<P>bitterness of being disappointed in the only quarter on which the



<P>happiness of my life depended, must excuse any appearance of



<P>asperity.&nbsp; If my presence is disagreeable to you, Miss Murray,"

he



<P>said (for I was looking about me to show how little I cared for



<P>him, so he thought I was tired of him, I suppose) - "if my presence



<P>is disagreeable to you, Miss Murray, you have only to promise me



<P>the favour I named, and I will relieve you at once.&nbsp; There are

many



<P>ladies - some even in this parish - who would be delighted to



<P>accept what you have so scornfully trampled under your feet.&nbsp; They



<P>would be naturally inclined to hate one whose surpassing loveliness



<P>has so completely estranged my heart from them and blinded me to



<P>their attractions; and a single hint of the truth from me to one of



<P>these would be sufficient to raise such a talk against you as would



<P>seriously injure your prospects, and diminish your chance of



<P>success with any other gentleman you or your mamma might design to



<P>entangle."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'"What do your mean, sir?" said I, ready to stamp with passion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'"I mean that this affair from beginning to end appears to me like



<P>a case of arrant flirtation, to say the least of it - such a case



<P>as you would find it rather inconvenient to have blazoned through



<P>the world:&nbsp; especially with the additions and exaggerations of

your



<P>female rivals, who would be too glad to publish the matter, if I



<P>only gave them a handle to it.&nbsp; But I promise you, on the faith

of



<P>a gentleman, that no word or syllable that could tend to your



<P>prejudice shall ever escape my lips, provided you will - "

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'"Well, well, I won't mention it," said I.&nbsp; "You may rely upon

my



<P>silence, if that can afford you any consolation."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'"You promise it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'"Yes," I answered; for I wanted to get rid of him now.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'"Farewell, then!" said he, in a most doleful, heart-sick tone; and



<P>with a look where pride vainly struggled against despair, he turned



<P>and went away:&nbsp; longing, no doubt, to get home, that he might shut



<P>himself up in his study and cry - if he doesn't burst into tears



<P>before he gets there.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But you have broken your promise already,' said I, truly horrified



<P>at her perfidy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh! it's only to you; I know you won't repeat it.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Certainly, I shall not:&nbsp; but you say you are going to tell your



<P>sister; and she will tell your brothers when they come home, and



<P>Brown immediately, if you do not tell her yourself; and Brown will



<P>blazon it, or be the means of blazoning it, throughout the



<P>country.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No, indeed, she won't.&nbsp; We shall not tell her at all, unless it

be



<P>under the promise of the strictest secrecy.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But how can you expect her to keep her promises better than her



<P>more enlightened mistress?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, well, she shan't hear it then,' said Miss Murray, somewhat



<P>snappishly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But you will tell your mamma, of course,' pursued I; 'and she will



<P>tell your papa.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Of course I shall tell mamma - that is the very thing that pleases



<P>me so much.&nbsp; I shall now be able to convince her how mistaken she



<P>was in her fears about me.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, THAT'S it, is it?&nbsp; I was wondering what it was that delighted



<P>you so much.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes; and another thing is, that I've humbled Mr. Hatfield so



<P>charmingly; and another - why, you must allow me some share of



<P>female vanity:&nbsp; I don't pretend to be without that most essential



<P>attribute of our sex - and if you had seen poor Hatfield's intense



<P>eagerness in making his ardent declaration and his flattering



<P>proposal, and his agony of mind, that no effort of pride could



<P>conceal, on being refused, you would have allowed I had some cause



<P>to be gratified.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'The greater his agony, I should think, the less your cause for



<P>gratification.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, nonsense!' cried the young lady, shaking herself with



<P>vexation.&nbsp; 'You either can't understand me, or you won't.&nbsp;

If I had



<P>not confidence in your magnanimity, I should think you envied me.



<P>But you will, perhaps, comprehend this cause of pleasure - which is



<P>as great as any - namely, that I am delighted with myself for my



<P>prudence, my self-command, my heartlessness, if you please.&nbsp; I

was



<P>not a bit taken by surprise, not a bit confused, or awkward, or



<P>foolish; I just acted and spoke as I ought to have done, and was



<P>completely my own mistress throughout.&nbsp; And here was a man,



<P>decidedly good-looking - Jane and Susan Green call him bewitchingly



<P>handsome I suppose they're two of the ladies he pretends would be



<P>so glad to have him; but, however, he was certainly a very clever,



<P>witty, agreeable companion - not what you call clever, but just



<P>enough to make him entertaining; and a man one needn't be ashamed



<P>of anywhere, and would not soon grow tired of; and to confess the



<P>truth, I rather liked him - better even, of late, than Harry



<P>Meltham - and he evidently idolised me; and yet, though he came



<P>upon me all alone and unprepared, I had the wisdom, and the pride,



<P>and the strength to refuse him - and so scornfully and coolly as I



<P>did:&nbsp; I have good reason to be proud of that.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And are you equally proud of having told him that his having the



<P>wealth of Sir Hugh Meltham would make no difference to you, when



<P>that was not the case; and of having promised to tell no one of his



<P>misadventure, apparently without the slightest intention of keeping



<P>your promise?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Of course! what else could I do?&nbsp; You would not have had me -

but



<P>I see, Miss Grey, you're not in a good temper.&nbsp; Here's Matilda;



<P>I'll see what she and mamma have to say about it.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She left me, offended at my want of sympathy, and thinking, no



<P>doubt, that I envied her.&nbsp; I did not - at least, I firmly believed



<P>I did not.&nbsp; I was sorry for her; I was amazed, disgusted at her



<P>heartless vanity; I wondered why so much beauty should be given to



<P>those who made so bad a use of it, and denied to some who would



<P>make it a benefit to both themselves and others.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But, God knows best, I concluded.&nbsp; There are, I suppose, some men



<P>as vain, as selfish, and as heartless as she is, and, perhaps, such



<P>women may be useful to punish them.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>NEXT Sunday was one of the gloomiest of April days - a day of



<P>thick, dark clouds, and heavy showers.&nbsp; None of the Murrays were



<P>disposed to attend church in the afternoon, excepting Rosalie:&nbsp;

she



<P>was bent upon going as usual; so she ordered the carriage, and I



<P>went with her:&nbsp; nothing loth, of course, for at church I might

look



<P>without fear of scorn or censure upon a form and face more pleasing



<P>to me than the most beautiful of God's creations; I might listen



<P>without disturbance to a voice more charming than the sweetest



<P>music to my ears; I might seem to hold communion with that soul in



<P>which I felt so deeply interested, and imbibe its purest thoughts



<P>and holiest aspirations, with no alloy to such felicity except the



<P>secret reproaches of my conscience, which would too often whisper



<P>that I was deceiving my own self, and mocking God with the service



<P>of a heart more bent upon the creature than the Creator.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sometimes, such thoughts would give me trouble enough; but



<P>sometimes I could quiet them with thinking - it is not the man, it



<P>is his goodness that I love.&nbsp; 'Whatsoever things are pure,



<P>whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are honest and of



<P>good report, think on these things.'&nbsp; We do well to worship God

in



<P>His works; and I know none of them in which so many of His



<P>attributes - so much of His own spirit shines, as in this His



<P>faithful servant; whom to know and not to appreciate, were obtuse



<P>insensibility in me, who have so little else to occupy my heart.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Almost immediately after the conclusion of the service, Miss Murray



<P>left the church.&nbsp; We had to stand in the porch, for it was raining,



<P>and the carriage was not yet come.&nbsp; I wondered at her coming forth



<P>so hastily, for neither young Meltham nor Squire Green was there;



<P>but I soon found it was to secure an interview with Mr. Weston as



<P>he came out, which he presently did.&nbsp; Having saluted us both, he



<P>would have passed on, but she detained him; first with observations



<P>upon the disagreeable weather, and then with asking if he would be



<P>so kind as to come some time to-morrow to see the granddaughter of



<P>the old woman who kept the porter's lodge, for the girl was ill of



<P>a fever, and wished to see him.&nbsp; He promised to do so.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And at what time will you be most likely to come, Mr. Weston?&nbsp;

The



<P>old woman will like to know when to expect you - you know such



<P>people think more about having their cottages in order when decent



<P>people come to see them than we are apt to suppose.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here was a wonderful instance of consideration from the thoughtless



<P>Miss Murray.&nbsp; Mr. Weston named an hour in the morning at which

he



<P>would endeavour, to be there.&nbsp; By this time the carriage was ready,



<P>and the footman was waiting, with an open umbrella, to escort Miss



<P>Murray through the churchyard.&nbsp; I was about to follow; but Mr.



<P>Weston had an umbrella too, and offered me the benefit of its



<P>shelter, for it was raining heavily.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No, thank you, I don't mind the rain,' I said.&nbsp; I always lacked



<P>common sense when taken by surprise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But you don't LIKE it, I suppose? - an umbrella will do you no



<P>harm at any rate,' he replied, with a smile that showed he was not



<P>offended; as a man of worse temper or less penetration would have



<P>been at such a refusal of his aid.&nbsp; I could not deny the truth

of



<P>his assertion, and so went with him to the carriage; he even



<P>offered me his hand on getting in:&nbsp; an unnecessary piece of



<P>civility, but I accepted that too, for fear of giving offence.&nbsp;

One



<P>glance he gave, one little smile at parting - it was but for a



<P>moment; but therein I read, or thought I read, a meaning that



<P>kindled in my heart a brighter flame of hope than had ever yet



<P>arisen.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I would have sent the footman back for you, Miss Grey, if you'd



<P>waited a moment - you needn't have taken Mr. Weston's umbrella,'



<P>observed Rosalie, with a very unamiable cloud upon her pretty face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I would have come without an umbrella, but Mr. Weston offered me



<P>the benefit of his, and I could not have refused it more than I did



<P>without offending him,' replied I, smiling placidly; for my inward



<P>happiness made that amusing, which would have wounded me at another



<P>time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The carriage was now in motion.&nbsp; Miss Murray bent forwards, and



<P>looked out of the window as we were passing Mr. Weston.&nbsp; He was



<P>pacing homewards along the causeway, and did not turn his head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Stupid ass!' cried she, throwing herself back again in the seat.



<P>'You don't know what you've lost by not looking this way!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'What has he lost?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'A bow from me, that would have raised him to the seventh heaven!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I made no answer.&nbsp; I saw she was out of humour, and I derived a



<P>secret gratification from the fact, not that she was vexed, but



<P>that she thought she had reason to be so.&nbsp; It made me think my



<P>hopes were not entirely the offspring of my wishes and imagination.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I mean to take up Mr. Weston instead of Mr. Hatfield,' said my



<P>companion, after a short pause, resuming something of her usual



<P>cheerfulness.&nbsp; 'The ball at Ashby Park takes place on Tuesday,

you



<P>know; and mamma thinks it very likely that Sir Thomas will propose



<P>to me then:&nbsp; such things are often done in the privacy of the ball-



<P>room, when gentlemen are most easily ensnared, and ladies most



<P>enchanting.&nbsp; But if I am to be married so soon, I must make the



<P>best of the present time:&nbsp; I am determined Hatfield shall not be



<P>the only man who shall lay his heart at my feet, and implore me to



<P>accept the worthless gift in vain.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'If you mean Mr. Weston to be one of your victims,' said I, with



<P>affected indifference, 'you will have to make such overtures



<P>yourself that you will find it difficult to draw back when he asks



<P>you to fulfil the expectations you have raised.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I don't suppose he will ask me to marry him, nor should I desire



<P>it:&nbsp; that would be rather too much presumption! but I intend him

to



<P>feel my power.&nbsp; He has felt it already, indeed:&nbsp; but he shall



<P>ACKNOWLEDGE it too; and what visionary hopes he may have, he must



<P>keep to himself, and only amuse me with the result of them - for a



<P>time.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh! that some kind spirit would whisper those words in his ear,' I



<P>inwardly exclaimed.&nbsp; I was far too indignant to hazard a reply

to



<P>her observation aloud; and nothing more was said about Mr. Weston



<P>that day, by me or in my hearing.&nbsp; But next morning, soon after



<P>breakfast, Miss Murray came into the schoolroom, where her sister



<P>was employed at her studies, or rather her lessons, for studies



<P>they were not, and said, 'Matilda, I want you to take a walk with



<P>me about eleven o'clock.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, I can't, Rosalie!&nbsp; I have to give orders about my new bridle



<P>and saddle-cloth, and speak to the rat-catcher about his dogs:



<P>Miss Grey must go with you.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No, I want you,' said Rosalie; and calling her sister to the



<P>window, she whispered an explanation in her ear; upon which the



<P>latter consented to go.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I remembered that eleven was the hour at which Mr. Weston proposed



<P>to come to the porter's lodge; and remembering that, I beheld the



<P>whole contrivance.&nbsp; Accordingly, at dinner, I was entertained with



<P>a long account of how Mr. Weston had overtaken them as they were



<P>walking along the road; and how they had had a long walk and talk



<P>with him, and really found him quite an agreeable companion; and



<P>how he must have been, and evidently was, delighted with them and



<P>their amazing condescension, &amp;c. &amp;c.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>AS we drove along, my spirits revived again, and I turned, with



<P>pleasure, to the contemplation of the new life upon which I was



<P>entering.&nbsp; But though it was not far past the middle of September,



<P>the heavy clouds and strong north-easterly wind combined to render



<P>the day extremely cold and dreary; and the journey seemed a very



<P>long one, for, as Smith observed, the roads were 'very heavy'; and



<P>certainly, his horse was very heavy too:&nbsp; it crawled up the hills,



<P>and crept down them, and only condescended to shake its sides in a



<P>trot where the road was at a dead level or a very gentle slope,



<P>which was rarely the case in those rugged regions; so that it was



<P>nearly one o'clock before we reached the place of our destination.



<P>Yet, after all, when we entered the lofty iron gateway, when we



<P>drove softly up the smooth, well-rolled carriage-road, with the



<P>green lawn on each side, studded with young trees, and approached



<P>the new but stately mansion of Wellwood, rising above its mushroom



<P>poplar-groves, my heart failed me, and I wished it were a mile or



<P>two farther off.&nbsp; For the first time in my life I must stand alone:



<P>there was no retreating now.&nbsp; I must enter that house, and



<P>introduce myself among its strange inhabitants.&nbsp; But how was it

to



<P>be done?&nbsp; True, I was near nineteen; but, thanks to my retired

life



<P>and the protecting care of my mother and sister, I well knew that



<P>many a girl of fifteen, or under, was gifted with a more womanly



<P>address, and greater ease and self-possession, than I was.&nbsp; Yet,

if



<P>Mrs. Bloomfield were a kind, motherly woman, I might do very well,



<P>after all; and the children, of course, I should soon be at ease



<P>with them - and Mr. Bloomfield, I hoped, I should have but little



<P>to do with.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Be calm, be calm, whatever happens,' I said within myself; and



<P>truly I kept this resolution so well, and was so fully occupied in



<P>steadying my nerves and stifling the rebellious flutter of my



<P>heart, that when I was admitted into the hall and ushered into the



<P>presence of Mrs. Bloomfield, I almost forgot to answer her polite



<P>salutation; and it afterwards struck me, that the little I did say



<P>was spoken in the tone of one half-dead or half-asleep.&nbsp; The lady,



<P>too, was somewhat chilly in her manner, as I discovered when I had



<P>time to reflect.&nbsp; She was a tall, spare, stately woman, with thick



<P>black hair, cold grey eyes, and extremely sallow complexion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With due politeness, however, she showed me my bedroom, and left me



<P>there to take a little refreshment.&nbsp; I was somewhat dismayed at

my



<P>appearance on looking in the glass:&nbsp; the cold wind had swelled

and



<P>reddened my hands, uncurled and entangled my hair, and dyed my face



<P>of a pale purple; add to this my collar was horridly crumpled, my



<P>frock splashed with mud, my feet clad in stout new boots, and as



<P>the trunks were not brought up, there was no remedy; so having



<P>smoothed my hair as well as I could, and repeatedly twitched my



<P>obdurate collar, I proceeded to clomp down the two flights of



<P>stairs, philosophizing as I went; and with some difficulty found my



<P>way into the room where Mrs. Bloomfield awaited me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She led me into the dining-room, where the family luncheon had been



<P>laid out.&nbsp; Some beefsteaks and half-cold potatoes were set before



<P>me; and while I dined upon these, she sat opposite, watching me (as



<P>I thought) and endeavouring to sustain something like a



<P>conversation - consisting chiefly of a succession of commonplace



<P>remarks, expressed with frigid formality:&nbsp; but this might be more



<P>my fault than hers, for I really could NOT converse.&nbsp; In fact,

my



<P>attention was almost wholly absorbed in my dinner:&nbsp; not from



<P>ravenous appetite, but from distress at the toughness of the



<P>beefsteaks, and the numbness of my hands, almost palsied by their



<P>five-hours' exposure to the bitter wind.&nbsp; I would gladly have eaten



<P>the potatoes and let the meat alone, but having got a large piece



<P>of the latter on to my plate, I could not be so impolite as to



<P>leave it; so, after many awkward and unsuccessful attempts to cut



<P>it with the knife, or tear it with the fork, or pull it asunder



<P>between them, sensible that the awful lady was a spectator to the



<P>whole transaction, I at last desperately grasped the knife and fork



<P>in my fists, like a child of two years old, and fell to work with



<P>all the little strength I possessed.&nbsp; But this needed some apology



<P>- with a feeble attempt at a laugh, I said, 'My hands are so



<P>benumbed with the cold that I can scarcely handle my knife and



<P>fork.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I daresay you would find it cold,' replied she with a cool,



<P>immutable gravity that did not serve to re-assure me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the ceremony was concluded, she led me into the sitting-room



<P>again, where she rang and sent for the children.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'You will find them not very far advanced in their attainments,'



<P>said she, 'for I have had so little time to attend to their



<P>education myself, and we have thought them too young for a



<P>governess till now; but I think they are clever children, and very



<P>apt to learn, especially the little boy; he is, I think, the flower



<P>of the flock - a generous, noble-spirited boy, one to be led, but



<P>not driven, and remarkable for always speaking the truth.&nbsp; He seems



<P>to scorn deception' (this was good news).&nbsp; 'His sister Mary Ann



<P>will require watching,' continued she, 'but she is a very good girl



<P>upon the whole; though I wish her to be kept out of the nursery as



<P>much as possible, as she is now almost six years old, and might



<P>acquire bad habits from the nurses.&nbsp; I have ordered her crib to

be



<P>placed in your room, and if you will be so kind as to overlook her



<P>washing and dressing, and take charge of her clothes, she need have



<P>nothing further to do with the nursery maid.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I replied I was quite willing to do so; and at that moment my young



<P>pupils entered the apartment, with their two younger sisters.



<P>Master Tom Bloomfield was a well-grown boy of seven, with a



<P>somewhat wiry frame, flaxen hair, blue eyes, small turned-up nose,



<P>and fair complexion.&nbsp; Mary Ann was a tall girl too, somewhat dark



<P>like her mother, but with a round full face and a high colour in



<P>her cheeks.&nbsp; The second sister was Fanny, a very pretty little



<P>girl; Mrs. Bloomfield assured me she was a remarkably gentle child,



<P>and required encouragement:&nbsp; she had not learned anything yet;

but



<P>in a few days, she would be four years old, and then she might take



<P>her first lesson in the alphabet, and be promoted to the



<P>schoolroom.&nbsp; The remaining one was Harriet, a little broad, fat,



<P>merry, playful thing of scarcely two, that I coveted more than all



<P>the rest - but with her I had nothing to do.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I talked to my little pupils as well as I could, and tried to



<P>render myself agreeable; but with little success I fear, for their



<P>mother's presence kept me under an unpleasant restraint.&nbsp; They,



<P>however, were remarkably free from shyness.&nbsp; They seemed bold,



<P>lively children, and I hoped I should soon be on friendly terms



<P>with them - the little boy especially, of whom I had heard such a



<P>favourable character from his mamma.&nbsp; In Mary Ann there was a



<P>certain affected simper, and a craving for notice, that I was sorry



<P>to observe.&nbsp; But her brother claimed all my attention to himself;



<P>he stood bolt upright between me and the fire, with his hands



<P>behind his back, talking away like an orator, occasionally



<P>interrupting his discourse with a sharp reproof to his sisters when



<P>they made too much noise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, Tom, what a darling you are!' exclaimed his mother.&nbsp; 'Come

and



<P>kiss dear mamma; and then won't you show Miss Grey your schoolroom,



<P>and your nice new books?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I won't kiss YOU, mamma; but I WILL show Miss Grey my schoolroom,



<P>and my new books.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And MY schoolroom, and MY new books, Tom,' said Mary Ann.



<P>'They're mine too.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'They're MINE,' replied he decisively.&nbsp; 'Come along, Miss Grey

-



<P>I'll escort you.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the room and books had been shown, with some bickerings



<P>between the brother and sister that I did my utmost to appease or



<P>mitigate, Mary Ann brought me her doll, and began to be very



<P>loquacious on the subject of its fine clothes, its bed, its chest



<P>of drawers, and other appurtenances; but Tom told her to hold her



<P>clamour, that Miss Grey might see his rocking-horse, which, with a



<P>most important bustle, he dragged forth from its corner into the



<P>middle of the room, loudly calling on me to attend to it.&nbsp; Then,



<P>ordering his sister to hold the reins, he mounted, and made me



<P>stand for ten minutes, watching how manfully he used his whip and



<P>spurs.&nbsp; Meantime, however, I admired Mary Ann's pretty doll, and



<P>all its possessions; and then told Master Tom he was a capital



<P>rider, but I hoped he would not use his whip and spurs so much when



<P>he rode a real pony.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, yes, I will!' said he, laying on with redoubled ardour.&nbsp; 'I'll



<P>cut into him like smoke!&nbsp; Eeh! my word! but he shall sweat for

it.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was very shocking; but I hoped in time to be able to work a



<P>reformation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Now you must put on your bonnet and shawl,' said the little hero,



<P>'and I'll show you my garden.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And MINE,' said Mary Ann.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Tom lifted his fist with a menacing gesture; she uttered a loud,



<P>shrill scream, ran to the other side of me, and made a face at him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Surely, Tom, you would not strike your sister!&nbsp; I hope I shall



<P>NEVER see you do that.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'You will sometimes:&nbsp; I'm obliged to do it now and then to keep

her



<P>in order.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But it is not your business to keep her in order, you know - that



<P>is for - '

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, now go and put on your bonnet.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I don't know - it is so very cloudy and cold, it seems likely to



<P>rain; - and you know I have had a long drive.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No matter - you MUST come; I shall allow of no excuses,' replied



<P>the consequential little gentleman.&nbsp; And, as it was the first day



<P>of our acquaintance, I thought I might as well indulge him.&nbsp; It

was



<P>too cold for Mary Ann to venture, so she stayed with her mamma, to



<P>the great relief of her brother, who liked to have me all to



<P>himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The garden was a large one, and tastefully laid out; besides



<P>several splendid dahlias, there were some other fine flowers still



<P>in bloom:&nbsp; but my companion would not give me time to examine them:



<P>I must go with him, across the wet grass, to a remote sequestered



<P>corner, the most important place in the grounds, because it



<P>contained HIS garden.&nbsp; There were two round beds, stocked with

a



<P>variety of plants.&nbsp; In one there was a pretty little rose-tree.&nbsp;

I



<P>paused to admire its lovely blossoms.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, never mind that!' said he, contemptuously.&nbsp; 'That's only MARY



<P>ANN'S garden; look, THIS is mine.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After I had observed every flower, and listened to a disquisition



<P>on every plant, I was permitted to depart; but first, with great



<P>pomp, he plucked a polyanthus and presented it to me, as one



<P>conferring a prodigious favour.&nbsp; I observed, on the grass about

his



<P>garden, certain apparatus of sticks and corn, and asked what they



<P>were.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Traps for birds.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Why do you catch them?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Papa says they do harm.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And what do you do with them when you catch them?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Different things.&nbsp; Sometimes I give them to the cat; sometimes

I



<P>cut them in pieces with my penknife; but the next, I mean to roast



<P>alive.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And why do you mean to do such a horrible thing?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'For two reasons:&nbsp; first, to see how long it will live - and then,



<P>to see what it will taste like.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But don't you know it is extremely wicked to do such things?



<P>Remember, the birds can feel as well as you; and think, how would



<P>you like it yourself?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, that's nothing!&nbsp; I'm not a bird, and I can't feel what I do

to



<P>them.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But you will have to feel it some time, Tom:&nbsp; you have heard where



<P>wicked people go to when they die; and if you don't leave off



<P>torturing innocent birds, remember, you will have to go there, and



<P>suffer just what you have made them suffer.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, pooh!&nbsp; I shan't.&nbsp; Papa knows how I treat them, and he

never



<P>blames me for it:&nbsp; he says it is just what HE used to do when HE



<P>was a boy.&nbsp; Last summer, he gave me a nest full of young sparrows,



<P>and he saw me pulling off their legs and wings, and heads, and



<P>never said anything; except that they were nasty things, and I must



<P>not let them soil my trousers:&nbsp; end Uncle Robson was there too,

and



<P>he laughed, and said I was a fine boy.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But what would your mamma say?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, she doesn't care! she says it's a pity to kill the pretty



<P>singing birds, but the naughty sparrows, and mice, and rats, I may



<P>do what I like with.&nbsp; So now, Miss Grey, you see it is NOT wicked.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I still think it is, Tom; and perhaps your papa and mamma would



<P>think so too, if they thought much about it.&nbsp; However,' I



<P>internally added, 'they may say what they please, but I am



<P>determined you shall do nothing of the kind, as long as I have



<P>power to prevent it.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He next took me across the lawn to see his mole-traps, and then



<P>into the stack-yard to see his weasel-traps:&nbsp; one of which, to

his



<P>great joy, contained a dead weasel; and then into the stable to



<P>see, not the fine carriage-horses, but a little rough colt, which



<P>he informed me had been bred on purpose for him, and he was to ride



<P>it as soon as it was properly trained.&nbsp; I tried to amuse the little



<P>fellow, and listened to all his chatter as complacently as I could;



<P>for I thought if he had any affections at all, I would endeavour to



<P>win them; and then, in time, I might be able to show him the error



<P>of his ways:&nbsp; but I looked in vain for that generous, noble spirit



<P>his mother talked of; though I could see he was not without a



<P>certain degree of quickness and penetration, when he chose to exert



<P>it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When we re-entered the house it was nearly tea-time.&nbsp; Master Tom



<P>told me that, as papa was from home, he and I and Mary Ann were to



<P>have tea with mamma, for a treat; for, on such occasions, she



<P>always dined at luncheon-time with them, instead of at six o'clock.



<P>Soon after tea, Mary Ann went to bed, but Tom favoured us with his



<P>company and conversation till eight.&nbsp; After he was gone, Mrs.



<P>Bloomfield further enlightened me on the subject of her children's



<P>dispositions and acquirements, and on what they were to learn, and



<P>how they were to be managed, and cautioned me to mention their



<P>defects to no one but herself.&nbsp; My mother had warned me before

to



<P>mention them as little as possible to HER, for people did not like



<P>to be told of their children's faults, and so I concluded I was to



<P>keep silence on them altogether.&nbsp; About half-past nine, Mrs.



<P>Bloomfield invited me to partake of a frugal supper of cold meat



<P>and bread.&nbsp; I was glad when that was over, and she took her bedroom



<P>candlestick and retired to rest; for though I wished to be pleased



<P>with her, her company was extremely irksome to me; and I could not



<P>help feeling that she was cold, grave, and forbidding - the very



<P>opposite of the kind, warm-hearted matron my hopes had depicted her



<P>to be.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>I ROSE next morning with a feeling of hopeful exhilaration, in



<P>spite of the disappointments already experienced; but I found the



<P>dressing of Mary Ann was no light matter, as her abundant hair was



<P>to be smeared with pomade, plaited in three long tails, and tied



<P>with bows of ribbon:&nbsp; a task my unaccustomed fingers found great



<P>difficulty in performing.&nbsp; She told me her nurse could do it in



<P>half the time, and, by keeping up a constant fidget of impatience,



<P>contrived to render me still longer.&nbsp; When all was done, we went



<P>into the schoolroom, where I met my other pupil, and chatted with



<P>the two till it was time to go down to breakfast.&nbsp; That meal being



<P>concluded, and a few civil words having been exchanged with Mrs.



<P>Bloomfield, we repaired to the schoolroom again, and commenced the



<P>business of the day.&nbsp; I found my pupils very backward, indeed;

but



<P>Tom, though averse to every species of mental exertion, was not



<P>without abilities.&nbsp; Mary Ann could scarcely read a word, and was

so



<P>careless and inattentive that I could hardly get on with her at



<P>all.&nbsp; However, by dint of great labour and patience, I managed

to



<P>get something done in the course of the morning, and then



<P>accompanied my young charge out into the garden and adjacent



<P>grounds, for a little recreation before dinner.&nbsp; There we got along



<P>tolerably together, except that I found they had no notion of going



<P>with me:&nbsp; I must go with them, wherever they chose to lead me.&nbsp;

I



<P>must run, walk, or stand, exactly as it suited their fancy.&nbsp; This,



<P>I thought, was reversing the order of things; and I found it doubly



<P>disagreeable, as on this as well as subsequent occasions, they



<P>seemed to prefer the dirtiest places and the most dismal



<P>occupations.&nbsp; But there was no remedy; either I must follow them,



<P>or keep entirely apart from them, and thus appear neglectful of my



<P>charge.&nbsp; To-day, they manifested a particular attachment to a well



<P>at the bottom of the lawn, where they persisted in dabbling with



<P>sticks and pebbles for above half an hour.&nbsp; I was in constant fear



<P>that their mother would see them from the window, and blame me for



<P>allowing them thus to draggle their clothes and wet their feet and



<P>hands, instead of taking exercise; but no arguments, commands, or



<P>entreaties could draw them away.&nbsp; If SHE did not see them, some

one



<P>else did - a gentleman on horseback had entered the gate and was



<P>proceeding up the road; at the distance of a few paces from us he



<P>paused, and calling to the children in a waspish penetrating tone,



<P>bade them 'keep out of that water.'&nbsp; 'Miss Grey,' said he, '(I



<P>suppose it IS Miss Grey), I am surprised that you should allow them



<P>to dirty their clothes in that manner!&nbsp; Don't you see how Miss



<P>Bloomfield has soiled her frock? and that Master Bloomfield's socks



<P>are quite wet? and both of them without gloves?&nbsp; Dear, dear!&nbsp;

Let



<P>me REQUEST that in future you will keep them DECENT at least!' so



<P>saying, he turned away, and continued his ride up to the house.



<P>This was Mr. Bloomfield.&nbsp; I was surprised that he should nominate



<P>his children Master and Miss Bloomfield; and still more so, that he



<P>should speak so uncivilly to me, their governess, and a perfect



<P>stranger to himself.&nbsp; Presently the bell rang to summon us in.&nbsp;

I



<P>dined with the children at one, while he and his lady took their



<P>luncheon at the same table.&nbsp; His conduct there did not greatly



<P>raise him in my estimation.&nbsp; He was a man of ordinary stature -



<P>rather below than above - and rather thin than stout, apparently



<P>between thirty and forty years of age:&nbsp; he had a large mouth, pale,



<P>dingy complexion, milky blue eyes, and hair the colour of a hempen



<P>cord.&nbsp; There was a roast leg of mutton before him:&nbsp; he helped

Mrs.



<P>Bloomfield, the children, and me, desiring me to cut up the



<P>children's meat; then, after twisting about the mutton in various



<P>directions, and eyeing it from different points, he pronounced it



<P>not fit to be eaten, and called for the cold beef.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'What is the matter with the mutton, my dear?' asked his mate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'It is quite overdone.&nbsp; Don't you taste, Mrs. Bloomfield, that

all



<P>the goodness is roasted out of it?&nbsp; And can't you see that all

that



<P>nice, red gravy is completely dried away?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, I think the BEEF will suit you.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The beef was set before him, and he began to carve, but with the



<P>most rueful expressions of discontent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'What is the matter with the BEEF, Mr. Bloomfield?&nbsp; I'm sure I



<P>thought it was very nice.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And so it WAS very nice.&nbsp; A nicer joint could not be; but it is



<P>QUITE spoiled,' replied he, dolefully.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'How so?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'How so!&nbsp; Why, don't you see how it is cut?&nbsp; Dear - dear!

it is



<P>quite shocking!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'They must have cut it wrong in the kitchen, then, for I'm sure I



<P>carved it quite properly here, yesterday.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No DOUBT they cut it wrong in the kitchen - the savages!&nbsp; Dear

-



<P>dear!&nbsp; Did ever any one see such a fine piece of beef so completely



<P>ruined?&nbsp; But remember that, in future, when a decent dish leaves



<P>this table, they shall not TOUCH it in the kitchen.&nbsp; Remember THAT,



<P>Mrs. Bloomfield!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Notwithstanding the ruinous state of the beef, the gentleman



<P>managed to out himself some delicate slices, part of which he ate



<P>in silence.&nbsp; When he next spoke, it was, in a less querulous tone,



<P>to ask what there was for dinner.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Turkey and grouse,' was the concise reply.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And what besides?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Fish.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'What kind of fish?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I don't know.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'YOU DON'T KNOW?' cried he, looking solemnly up from his plate, and



<P>suspending his knife and fork in astonishment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No.&nbsp; I told the cook to get some fish - I did not particularize



<P>what.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, that beats everything!&nbsp; A lady professes to keep house,

and



<P>doesn't even know what fish is for dinner! professes to order fish,



<P>and doesn't specify what!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Perhaps, Mr. Bloomfield, you will order dinner yourself in



<P>future.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nothing more was said; and I was very glad to get out of the room



<P>with my pupils; for I never felt so ashamed and uncomfortable in my



<P>life for anything that was not my own fault.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the afternoon we applied to lessons again:&nbsp; then went out again;



<P>then had tea in the schoolroom; then I dressed Mary Ann for



<P>dessert; and when she and her brother had gone down to the dining-



<P>room, I took the opportunity of beginning a letter to my dear



<P>friends at home:&nbsp; but the children came up before I had half



<P>completed it.&nbsp; At seven I had to put Mary Ann to bed; then I played



<P>with Tom till eight, when he, too, went; and I finished my letter



<P>and unpacked my clothes, which I had hitherto found no opportunity



<P>for doing, and, finally, went to bed myself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But this is a very favourable specimen of a day's proceedings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>My task of instruction and surveillance, instead of becoming easier



<P>as my charges and I got better accustomed to each other, became



<P>more arduous as their characters unfolded.&nbsp; The name of governess,



<P>I soon found, was a mere mockery as applied to me:&nbsp; my pupils had



<P>no more notion of obedience than a wild, unbroken colt.&nbsp; The



<P>habitual fear of their father's peevish temper, and the dread of



<P>the punishments he was wont to inflict when irritated, kept them



<P>generally within bounds in his immediate presence.&nbsp; The girls,

too,



<P>had some fear of their mother's anger; and the boy might



<P>occasionally be bribed to do as she bid him by the hope of reward;



<P>but I had no rewards to offer; and as for punishments, I was given



<P>to understand, the parents reserved that privilege to themselves;



<P>and yet they expected me to keep my pupils in order.&nbsp; Other



<P>children might be guided by the fear of anger and the desire of



<P>approbation; but neither the one nor the other had any effect upon



<P>these.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Master Tom, not content with refusing to be ruled, must needs set



<P>up as a ruler, and manifested a determination to keep, not only his



<P>sisters, but his governess in order, by violent manual and pedal



<P>applications; and, as he was a tall, strong boy of his years, this



<P>occasioned no trifling inconvenience.&nbsp; A few sound boxes on the



<P>ear, on such occasions, might have settled the matter easily



<P>enough:&nbsp; but as, in that case, he might make up some story to his



<P>mother which she would be sure to believe, as she had such unshaken



<P>faith in his veracity - though I had already discovered it to be by



<P>no means unimpeachable - I determined to refrain from striking him,



<P>even in self-defence; and, in his most violent moods, my only



<P>resource was to throw him on his back and hold his hands and feet



<P>till the frenzy was somewhat abated.&nbsp; To the difficulty of



<P>preventing him from doing what he ought not, was added that of



<P>forcing him to do what he ought.&nbsp; Often he would positively refuse



<P>to learn, or to repeat his lessons, or even to look at his book.



<P>Here, again, a good birch rod might have been serviceable; but, as



<P>my powers were so limited, I must make the best use of what I had.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As there were no settled hours for study and play, I resolved to



<P>give my pupils a certain task, which, with moderate attention, they



<P>could perform in a short time; and till this was done, however



<P>weary I was, or however perverse they might be, nothing short of



<P>parental interference should induce me to suffer them to leave the



<P>schoolroom, even if I should sit with my chair against the door to



<P>keep them in.&nbsp; Patience, Firmness, and Perseverance were my only



<P>weapons; and these I resolved to use to the utmost.&nbsp; I determined



<P>always strictly to fulfil the threats and promises I made; and, to



<P>that end, I must be cautious to threaten and promise nothing that I



<P>could not perform.&nbsp; Then, I would carefully refrain from all



<P>useless irritability and indulgence of my own ill-temper:&nbsp; when



<P>they behaved tolerably, I would be as kind and obliging as it was



<P>in my power to be, in order to make the widest possible distinction



<P>between good and bad conduct; I would reason with them, too, in the



<P>simplest and most effective manner.&nbsp; When I reproved them, or



<P>refused to gratify their wishes, after a glaring fault, it should



<P>be more in sorrow than in anger:&nbsp; their little hymns and prayers

I



<P>would make plain and clear to their understanding; when they said



<P>their prayers at night and asked pardon for their offences, I would



<P>remind them of the sins of the past day, solemnly, but in perfect



<P>kindness, to avoid raising a spirit of opposition; penitential



<P>hymns should be said by the naughty, cheerful ones by the



<P>comparatively good; and every kind of instruction I would convey to



<P>them, as much as possible, by entertaining discourse - apparently



<P>with no other object than their present amusement in view.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>By these means I hoped in time both to benefit the children and to



<P>gain the approbation of their parents; and also to convince my



<P>friends at home that I was not so wanting in skill and prudence as



<P>they supposed.&nbsp; I knew the difficulties I had to contend with were



<P>great; but I knew (at least I believed) unremitting patience and



<P>perseverance could overcome them; and night and morning I implored



<P>Divine assistance to this end.&nbsp; But either the children were so



<P>incorrigible, the parents so unreasonable, or myself so mistaken in



<P>my views, or so unable to carry them out, that my best intentions



<P>and most strenuous efforts seemed productive of no better result



<P>than sport to the children, dissatisfaction to their parents, and



<P>torment to myself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The task of instruction was as arduous for the body as the mind.&nbsp;

I



<P>had to run after my pupils to catch them, to carry or drag them to



<P>the table, and often forcibly to hold them there till the lesson



<P>was done.&nbsp; Tom I frequently put into a corner, seating myself



<P>before him in a chair, with a book which contained the little task



<P>that must be said or read, before he was released, in my hand.&nbsp;

He



<P>was not strong enough to push both me and the chair away, so he



<P>would stand twisting his body and face into the most grotesque and



<P>singular contortions - laughable, no doubt, to an unconcerned



<P>spectator, but not to me - and uttering loud yells and doleful



<P>outcries, intended to represent weeping but wholly without the



<P>accompaniment of tears.&nbsp; I knew this was done solely for the



<P>purpose of annoying me; and, therefore, however I might inwardly



<P>tremble with impatience and irritation, I manfully strove to



<P>suppress all visible signs of molestation, and affected to sit with



<P>calm indifference, waiting till it should please him to cease this



<P>pastime, and prepare for a run in the garden, by casting his eye on



<P>the book and reading or repeating the few words he was required to



<P>say.&nbsp; Sometimes he was determined to do his writing badly; and

I



<P>had to hold his hand to prevent him from purposely blotting or



<P>disfiguring the paper.&nbsp; Frequently I threatened that, if he did

not



<P>do better, he should have another line:&nbsp; then he would stubbornly



<P>refuse to write this line; and I, to save my word, had finally to



<P>resort to the expedient of holding his fingers upon the pen, and



<P>forcibly drawing his hand up and down, till, in spite of his



<P>resistance, the line was in some sort completed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Yet Tom was by no means the most unmanageable of my pupils:



<P>sometimes, to my great joy, he would have the sense to see that his



<P>wisest policy was to finish his tasks, and go out and amuse himself



<P>till I and his sisters came to join him; which frequently was not



<P>at all, for Mary Ann seldom followed his example in this



<P>particular:&nbsp; she apparently preferred rolling on the floor to any



<P>other amusement:&nbsp; down she would drop like a leaden weight; and



<P>when I, with great difficulty, had succeeded in rooting her thence,



<P>I had still to hold her up with one arm, while with the other I



<P>held the book from which she was to read or spell her lesson.&nbsp;

As



<P>the dead weight of the big girl of six became too heavy for one arm



<P>to bear, I transferred it to the other; or, if both were weary of



<P>the burden, I carried her into a corner, and told her she might



<P>come out when she should find the use of her feet, and stand up:



<P>but she generally preferred lying there like a log till dinner or



<P>teatime, when, as I could not deprive her of her meals, she must be



<P>liberated, and would come crawling out with a grin of triumph on



<P>her round, red face.&nbsp; Often she would stubbornly refuse to



<P>pronounce some particular word in her lesson; and now I regret the



<P>lost labour I have had in striving to conquer her obstinacy.&nbsp; If

I



<P>had passed it over as a matter of no consequence, it would have



<P>been better for both parties, than vainly striving to overcome it



<P>as I did; but I thought it my absolute duty to crush this vicious



<P>tendency in the bud:&nbsp; and so it was, if I could have done it; and



<P>had my powers been less limited, I might have enforced obedience;



<P>but, as it was, it was a trial of strength between her and me, in



<P>which she generally came off victorious; and every victory served



<P>to encourage and strengthen her for a future contest.&nbsp; In vain

I



<P>argued, coaxed, entreated, threatened, scolded; in vain I kept her



<P>in from play, or, if obliged to take her out, refused to play with



<P>her, or to speak kindly or have anything to do with her; in vain I



<P>tried to set before her the advantages of doing as she was bid, and



<P>being loved, and kindly treated in consequence, and the



<P>disadvantages of persisting in her absurd perversity.&nbsp; Sometimes,



<P>when she would ask me to do something for her, I would answer, -



<P>'Yes, I will, Mary Ann, if you will only say that word.&nbsp; Come!



<P>you'd better say it at once, and have no more trouble about it.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Then, of course, I can do nothing for you.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With me, at her age, or under, neglect and disgrace were the most



<P>dreadful of punishments; but on her they made no impression.



<P>Sometimes, exasperated to the utmost pitch, I would shake her



<P>violently by the shoulder, or pull her long hair, or put her in the



<P>corner; for which she punished me with loud, shrill, piercing



<P>screams, that went through my head like a knife.&nbsp; She knew I hated



<P>this, and when she had shrieked her utmost, would look into my face



<P>with an air of vindictive satisfaction, exclaiming, - 'NOW, then!



<P>THAT'S for you!' and then shriek again and again, till I was forced



<P>to stop my ears.&nbsp; Often these dreadful cries would bring Mrs.



<P>Bloomfield up to inquire what was the matter?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Mary Ann is a naughty girl, ma'am.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But what are these shocking screams?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'She is screaming in a passion.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I never heard such a dreadful noise!&nbsp; You might be killing her.



<P>Why is she not out with her brother?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I cannot get her to finish her lessons.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'But Mary Ann must be a GOOD girl, and finish her lessons.'&nbsp; This



<P>was blandly spoken to the child.&nbsp; 'And I hope I shall NEVER hear



<P>such terrible cries again!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And fixing her cold, stony eyes upon me with a look that could not



<P>be mistaken, she would shut the door, and walk away.&nbsp; Sometimes

I



<P>would try to take the little obstinate creature by surprise, and



<P>casually ask her the word while she was thinking of something else;



<P>frequently she would begin to say it, and then suddenly cheek



<P>herself, with a provoking look that seemed to say, 'Ah! I'm too



<P>sharp for you; you shan't trick it out of me, either.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On another occasion, I pretended to forget the whole affair; and



<P>talked and played with her as usual, till night, when I put her to



<P>bed; then bending over her, while she lay all smiles and good



<P>humour, just before departing, I said, as cheerfully and kindly as



<P>before - 'Now, Mary Ann, just tell me that word before I kiss you



<P>good-night.&nbsp; You are a good girl now, and, of course, you will

say



<P>it.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'No, I won't.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Then I can't kiss you.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Well, I don't care.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In vain I expressed my sorrow; in vain I lingered for some symptom



<P>of contrition; she really 'didn't care,' and I left her alone, and



<P>in darkness, wondering most of all at this last proof of insensate



<P>stubbornness.&nbsp; In MY childhood I could not imagine a more



<P>afflictive punishment than for my mother to refuse to kiss me at



<P>night:&nbsp; the very idea was terrible.&nbsp; More than the idea I

never



<P>felt, for, happily, I never committed a fault that was deemed



<P>worthy of such penalty; but once I remember, for some transgression



<P>of my sister's, our mother thought proper to inflict it upon her:



<P>what SHE felt, I cannot tell; but my sympathetic tears and



<P>suffering for her sake I shall not soon forget.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Another troublesome trait in Mary Ann was her incorrigible



<P>propensity to keep running into the nursery, to play with her



<P>little sisters and the nurse.&nbsp; This was natural enough, but, as

it



<P>was against her mother's express desire, I, of course, forbade her



<P>to do so, and did my utmost to keep her with me; but that only



<P>increased her relish for the nursery, and the more I strove to keep



<P>her out of it, the oftener she went, and the longer she stayed, to



<P>the great dissatisfaction of Mrs. Bloomfield, who, I well knew,



<P>would impute all the blame of the matter to me.&nbsp; Another of my



<P>trials was the dressing in the morning:&nbsp; at one time she would

not



<P>be washed; at another she would not be dressed, unless she might



<P>wear some particular frock, that I knew her mother would not like



<P>her to have; at another she would scream and run away if I



<P>attempted to touch her hair.&nbsp; So that, frequently, when, after

much



<P>trouble and toil, I had, at length, succeeded in bringing her down,



<P>the breakfast was nearly half over; and black looks from 'mamma,'



<P>and testy observations from 'papa,' spoken at me, if not to me,



<P>were sure to be my meed:&nbsp; for few things irritated the latter so



<P>much as want of punctuality at meal times.&nbsp; Then, among the minor



<P>annoyances, was my inability to satisfy Mrs. Bloomfield with her



<P>daughter's dress; and the child's hair 'was never fit to be seen.'



<P>Sometimes, as a powerful reproach to me, she would perform the



<P>office of tire woman herself, and then complain bitterly of the



<P>trouble it gave her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When little Fanny came into the schoolroom, I hoped she would be



<P>mild and inoffensive, at least; but a few days, if not a few hours,



<P>sufficed to destroy the illusion:&nbsp; I found her a mischievous,



<P>intractable little creature, given up to falsehood and deception,



<P>young as she was, and alarmingly fond of exercising her two



<P>favourite weapons of offence and defence:&nbsp; that of spitting in

the



<P>faces of those who incurred her displeasure, and bellowing like a



<P>bull when her unreasonable desires were not gratified.&nbsp; As she,



<P>generally, was pretty quiet in her parents' presence, and they were



<P>impressed with the notion of her being a remarkably gentle child,



<P>her falsehoods were readily believed, and her loud uproars led them



<P>to suspect harsh and injudicious treatment on my part; and when, at



<P>length, her bad disposition became manifest even to their



<P>prejudiced eyes, I felt that the whole was attributed to me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'What a naughty girl Fanny is getting!' Mrs. Bloomfield would say



<P>to her spouse.&nbsp; 'Don't you observe, my dear, how she is altered



<P>since she entered the schoolroom?&nbsp; She will soon be as bad as the



<P>other two; and, I am sorry to say, they have quite deteriorated of



<P>late.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'You may say that,' was the answer.&nbsp; 'I've been thinking that same



<P>myself.&nbsp; I thought when we got them a governess they'd improve;



<P>but, instead of that, they get worse and worse:&nbsp; I don't know how



<P>it is with their learning, but their habits, I know, make no sort



<P>of improvement; they get rougher, and dirtier, and more unseemly



<P>every day.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I knew this was all pointed at me; and these, and all similar



<P>innuendoes, affected me far more deeply than any open accusations



<P>would have done; for against the latter I should have been roused



<P>to speak in my own defence:&nbsp; now I judged it my wisest plan to



<P>subdue every resentful impulse, suppress every sensitive shrinking,



<P>and go on perseveringly, doing my best; for, irksome as my



<P>situation was, I earnestly wished to retain it.&nbsp; I thought, if

I



<P>could struggle on with unremitting firmness and integrity, the



<P>children would in time become more humanized:&nbsp; every month would



<P>contribute to make them some little wiser, and, consequently, more



<P>manageable; for a child of nine or ten as frantic and ungovernable



<P>as these at six and seven would be a maniac.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I flattered myself I was benefiting my parents and sister by my



<P>continuance here; for small as the salary was, I still was earning



<P>something, and with strict economy I could easily manage to have



<P>something to spare for them, if they would favour me by taking it.



<P>Then it was by my own will that I had got the place:&nbsp; I had brought



<P>all this tribulation on myself, and I was determined to bear it;



<P>nay, more than that, I did not even regret the step I had taken.&nbsp;

I



<P>longed to show my friends that, even now, I was competent to



<P>undertake the charge, and able to acquit myself honourably to the



<P>end; and if ever I felt it degrading to submit so quietly, or



<P>intolerable to toil so constantly, I would turn towards my home,



<P>and say within myself -

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They may crush, but they shall not subdue me!



<P>'Tis of thee that I think, not of them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>About Christmas I was allowed to visit home; but my holiday was



<P>only of a fortnight's duration:&nbsp; 'For,' said Mrs. Bloomfield, 'I



<P>thought, as you had seen your friends so lately, you would not care



<P>for a longer stay.'&nbsp; I left her to think so still:&nbsp; but she

little



<P>knew how long, how wearisome those fourteen weeks of absence had



<P>been to me; how intensely I had longed for my holidays, how greatly



<P>I was disappointed at their curtailment.&nbsp; Yet she was not to blame



<P>in this.&nbsp; I had never told her my feelings, and she could not be



<P>expected to divine them; I had not been with her a full term, and



<P>she was justified in not allowing me a full vacation.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>CHAPTER XVII - CONFESSIONS</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>AS I am in the way of confessions I may as well acknowledge that,



<P>about this time, I paid more attention to dress than ever I had



<P>done before.&nbsp; This is not saying much - for hitherto I had been

a



<P>little neglectful in that particular; but now, also, it was no



<P>uncommon thing to spend as much as two minutes in the contemplation



<P>of my own image in the glass; though I never could derive any



<P>consolation from such a study.&nbsp; I could discover no beauty in those



<P>marked features, that pale hollow cheek, and ordinary dark brown



<P>hair; there might be intellect in the forehead, there might be



<P>expression in the dark grey eyes, but what of that? - a low Grecian



<P>brow, and large black eyes devoid of sentiment would be esteemed



<P>far preferable.&nbsp; It is foolish to wish for beauty.&nbsp; Sensible

people



<P>never either desire it for themselves or care about it in others.



<P>If the mind be but well cultivated, and the heart well disposed, no



<P>one ever cares for the exterior.&nbsp; So said the teachers of our



<P>childhood; and so say we to the children of the present day.&nbsp; All



<P>very judicious and proper, no doubt; but are such assertions



<P>supported by actual experience?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>We are naturally disposed to love what gives us pleasure, and what



<P>more pleasing than a beautiful face - when we know no harm of the



<P>possessor at least?&nbsp; A little girl loves her bird - Why?&nbsp;

Because



<P>it lives and feels; because it is helpless and harmless?&nbsp; A toad,



<P>likewise, lives and feels, and is equally helpless and harmless;



<P>but though she would not hurt a toad, she cannot love it like the



<P>bird, with its graceful form, soft feathers, and bright, speaking



<P>eyes.&nbsp; If a woman is fair and amiable, she is praised for both



<P>qualities, but especially the former, by the bulk of mankind:&nbsp;

if,



<P>on the other hand, she is disagreeable in person and character, her



<P>plainness is commonly inveighed against as her greatest crime,



<P>because, to common observers, it gives the greatest offence; while,



<P>if she is plain and good, provided she is a person of retired



<P>manners and secluded life, no one ever knows of her goodness,



<P>except her immediate connections.&nbsp; Others, on the contrary, are



<P>disposed to form unfavourable opinions of her mind, and



<P>disposition, if it be but to excuse themselves for their



<P>instinctive dislike of one so unfavoured by nature; and VISA VERSA



<P>with her whose angel form conceals a vicious heart, or sheds a



<P>false, deceitful charm over defects and foibles that would not be



<P>tolerated in another.&nbsp; They that have beauty, let them be thankful



<P>for it, and make a good use of it, like any other talent; they that



<P>have it not, let them console themselves, and do the best they can



<P>without it:&nbsp; certainly, though liable to be over-estimated, it

is a



<P>gift of God, and not to be despised.&nbsp; Many will feel this who have



<P>felt that they could love, and whose hearts tell them that they are



<P>worthy to be loved again; while yet they are debarred, by the lack



<P>of this or some such seeming trifle, from giving and receiving that



<P>happiness they seem almost made to feel and to impart.&nbsp; As well



<P>might the humble glowworm despise that power of giving light



<P>without which the roving fly might pass her and repass her a



<P>thousand times, and never rest beside her:&nbsp; she might hear her



<P>winged darling buzzing over and around her; he vainly seeking her,



<P>she longing to be found, but with no power to make her presence



<P>known, no voice to call him, no wings to follow his flight; - the



<P>fly must seek another mate, the worm must live and die alone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Such were some of my reflections about this period.&nbsp; I might go

on



<P>prosing more and more, I might dive much deeper, and disclose other



<P>thoughts, propose questions the reader might be puzzled to answer,



<P>and deduce arguments that might startle his prejudices, or,



<P>perhaps, provoke his ridicule, because he could not comprehend



<P>them; but I forbear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, therefore, let us return to Miss Murray.&nbsp; She accompanied

her



<P>mamma to the ball on Tuesday; of course splendidly attired, and



<P>delighted with her prospects and her charms.&nbsp; As Ashby Park was



<P>nearly ten miles distant from Horton Lodge, they had to set out



<P>pretty early, and I intended to have spent the evening with Nancy



<P>Brown, whom I had not seen for a long time; but my kind pupil took



<P>care I should spend it neither there nor anywhere else beyond the



<P>limits of the schoolroom, by giving me a piece of music to copy,



<P>which kept me closely occupied till bed-time.&nbsp; About eleven next



<P>morning, as soon as she had left her room, she came to tell me her



<P>news.&nbsp; Sir Thomas had indeed proposed to her at the ball; an event



<P>which reflected great credit on her mamma's sagacity, if not upon



<P>her skill in contrivance.&nbsp; I rather incline to the belief that

she



<P>had first laid her plans, and then predicted their success.&nbsp; The



<P>offer had been accepted, of course, and the bridegroom elect was



<P>coming that day to settle matters with Mr. Murray.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Rosalie was pleased with the thoughts of becoming mistress of Ashby



<P>Park; she was elated with the prospect of the bridal ceremony and



<P>its attendant splendour and eclat, the honeymoon spent abroad, and



<P>the subsequent gaieties she expected to enjoy in London and



<P>elsewhere; she appeared pretty well pleased too, for the time



<P>being, with Sir Thomas himself, because she had so lately seen him,



<P>danced with him, and been flattered by him; but, after all, she



<P>seemed to shrink from the idea of being so soon united:&nbsp; she wished



<P>the ceremony to be delayed some months, at least; and I wished it



<P>too.&nbsp; It seemed a horrible thing to hurry on the inauspicious



<P>match, and not to give the poor creature time to think and reason



<P>on the irrevocable step she was about to take.&nbsp; I made no



<P>pretension to 'a mother's watchful, anxious care,' but I was amazed



<P>and horrified at Mrs. Murray's heartlessness, or want of thought



<P>for the real good of her child; and by my unheeded warnings and



<P>exhortations, I vainly strove to remedy the evil.&nbsp; Miss Murray

only



<P>laughed at what I said; and I soon found that her reluctance to an



<P>immediate union arose chiefly from a desire to do what execution



<P>she could among the young gentlemen of her acquaintance, before she



<P>was incapacitated from further mischief of the kind.&nbsp; It was for



<P>this cause that, before confiding to me the secret of her



<P>engagement, she had extracted a promise that I would not mention a



<P>word on the subject to any one.&nbsp; And when I saw this, and when

I



<P>beheld her plunge more recklessly than ever into the depths of



<P>heartless coquetry, I had no more pity for her.&nbsp; 'Come what will,'



<P>I thought, 'she deserves it.&nbsp; Sir Thomas cannot be too bad for

her;



<P>and the sooner she is incapacitated from deceiving and injuring



<P>others the better.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The wedding was fixed for the first of June.&nbsp; Between that and

the



<P>critical ball was little more than six weeks; but, with Rosalie's



<P>accomplished skill and resolute exertion, much might be done, even



<P>within that period; especially as Sir Thomas spent most of the



<P>interim in London; whither he went up, it was said, to settle



<P>affairs with his lawyer, and make other preparations for the



<P>approaching nuptials.&nbsp; He endeavoured to supply the want of his



<P>presence by a pretty constant fire of billets-doux; but these did



<P>not attract the neighbours' attention, and open their eyes, as



<P>personal visits would have done; and old Lady Ashby's haughty, sour



<P>spirit of reserve withheld her from spreading the news, while her



<P>indifferent health prevented her coming to visit her future



<P>daughter-in-law; so that, altogether, this affair was kept far



<P>closer than such things usually are.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Rosalie would sometimes show her lover's epistles to me, to



<P>convince me what a kind, devoted husband he would make.&nbsp; She showed



<P>me the letters of another individual, too, the unfortunate Mr.



<P>Green, who had not the courage, or, as she expressed it, the



<P>'spunk,' to plead his cause in person, but whom one denial would



<P>not satisfy:&nbsp; he must write again and again.&nbsp; He would not

have



<P>done so if he could have seen the grimaces his fair idol made over



<P>his moving appeals to her feelings, and heard her scornful



<P>laughter, and the opprobrious epithets she heaped upon him for his



<P>perseverance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Why don't you tell him, at once, that you are engaged?' I asked.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, I don't want him to know that,' replied she.&nbsp; 'If he knew

it,



<P>his sisters and everybody would know it, and then there would be an



<P>end of my - ahem!&nbsp; And, besides, if I told him that, he would think



<P>my engagement was the only obstacle, and that I would have him if I



<P>were free; which I could not bear that any man should think, and



<P>he, of all others, at least.&nbsp; Besides, I don't care for his



<P>letters,' she added, contemptuously; 'he may write as often as he



<P>pleases, and look as great a calf as he likes when I meet him; it



<P>only amuses me.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meantime, young Meltham was pretty frequent in his visits to the



<P>house or transits past it; and, judging by Matilda's execrations



<P>and reproaches, her sister paid more attention to him than civility



<P>required; in other words, she carried on as animated a flirtation



<P>as the presence of her parents would admit.&nbsp; She made some attempts



<P>to bring Mr. Hatfield once more to her feet; but finding them



<P>unsuccessful, she repaid his haughty indifference with still



<P>loftier scorn, and spoke of him with as much disdain and



<P>detestation as she had formerly done of his curate.&nbsp; But, amid

all



<P>this, she never for a moment lost sight of Mr. Weston.&nbsp; She



<P>embraced every opportunity of meeting him, tried every art to



<P>fascinate him, and pursued him with as much perseverance as if she



<P>really loved him and no other, and the happiness of her life



<P>depended upon eliciting a return of affection.&nbsp; Such conduct was



<P>completely beyond my comprehension.&nbsp; Had I seen it depicted in

a



<P>novel, I should have thought it unnatural; had I heard it described



<P>by others, I should have deemed it a mistake or an exaggeration;



<P>but when I saw it with my own eyes, and suffered from it too, I



<P>could only conclude that excessive vanity, like drunkenness,



<P>hardens the heart, enslaves the faculties, and perverts the



<P>feelings; and that dogs are not the only creatures which, when



<P>gorged to the throat, will yet gloat over what they cannot devour,



<P>and grudge the smallest morsel to a starving brother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She now became extremely beneficent to the poor cottagers.&nbsp; Her



<P>acquaintance among them was more widely extended, her visits to



<P>their humble dwellings were more frequent and excursive than they



<P>had ever been before.&nbsp; Hereby, she earned among them the reputation



<P>of a condescending and very charitable young lady; and their



<P>encomiums were sure to be repeated to Mr. Weston:&nbsp; whom also she



<P>had thus a daily chance of meeting in one or other of their abodes,



<P>or in her transits to and fro; and often, likewise, she could



<P>gather, through their gossip, to what places he was likely to go at



<P>such and such a time, whether to baptize a child, or to visit the



<P>aged, the sick, the sad, or the dying; and most skilfully she laid



<P>her plans accordingly.&nbsp; In these excursions she would sometimes

go



<P>with her sister - whom, by some means, she had persuaded or bribed



<P>to enter into her schemes - sometimes alone, never, now, with me;



<P>so that I was debarred the pleasure of seeing Mr. Weston, or



<P>hearing his voice even in conversation with another:&nbsp; which would



<P>certainly have been a very great pleasure, however hurtful or



<P>however fraught with pain.&nbsp; I could not even see him at church:



<P>for Miss Murray, under some trivial pretext, chose to take



<P>possession of that corner in the family pew which had been mine



<P>ever since I came; and, unless I had the presumption to station



<P>myself between Mr. and Mrs. Murray, I must sit with my back to the



<P>pulpit, which I accordingly did.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, also, I never walked home with my pupils:&nbsp; they said their



<P>mamma thought it did not look well to see three people out of the



<P>family walking, and only two going in the carriage; and, as they



<P>greatly preferred walking in fine weather, I should be honoured by



<P>going with the seniors.&nbsp; 'And besides,' said they, 'you can't walk



<P>as fast as we do; you know you're always lagging behind.'&nbsp; I knew



<P>these were false excuses, but I made no objections, and never



<P>contradicted such assertions, well knowing the motives which



<P>dictated them.&nbsp; And in the afternoons, during those six memorable



<P>weeks, I never went to church at all.&nbsp; If I had a cold, or any



<P>slight indisposition, they took advantage of that to make me stay



<P>at home; and often they would tell me they were not going again



<P>that day, themselves, and then pretend to change their minds, and



<P>set off without telling me:&nbsp; so managing their departure that I



<P>never discovered the change of purpose till too late.&nbsp; Upon their



<P>return home, on one of these occasions, they entertained me with an



<P>animated account of a conversation they had had with Mr. Weston as



<P>they came along.&nbsp; 'And he asked if you were ill, Miss Grey,' said



<P>Matilda; 'but we told him you were quite well, only you didn't want



<P>to come to church - so he'll think you're turned wicked.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>All chance meetings on week-days were likewise carefully prevented;



<P>for, lest I should go to see poor Nancy Brown or any other person,



<P>Miss Murray took good care to provide sufficient employment for all



<P>my leisure hours.&nbsp; There was always some drawing to finish, some



<P>music to copy, or some work to do, sufficient to incapacitate me



<P>from indulging in anything beyond a short walk about the grounds,



<P>however she or her sister might be occupied.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One morning, having sought and waylaid Mr. Weston, they returned in



<P>high glee to give me an account of their interview.&nbsp; 'And he asked



<P>after you again,' said Matilda, in spite of her sister's silent but



<P>imperative intimation that she should hold her tongue.&nbsp; 'He



<P>wondered why you were never with us, and thought you must have



<P>delicate health, as you came out so seldom.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'He didn't Matilda - what nonsense you're talking!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Oh, Rosalie, what a lie!&nbsp; He did, you know; and you said - Don't,



<P>Rosalie - hang it! - I won't be pinched so!&nbsp; And, Miss Grey,



<P>Rosalie told him you were quite well, but you were always so buried



<P>in your books that you had no pleasure in anything else.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'What an idea he must have of me!' I thought.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'And,' I asked, 'does old Nancy ever inquire about me?'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'Yes; and we tell her you are so fond of reading and drawing that



<P>you can do nothing else.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'That is not the case though; if you had told her I was so busy I



<P>could not come to see her, it would have been nearer the truth.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>'I don't think it would,' replied Miss Murray, suddenly kindling



<P>up; 'I'm sure you have plenty of time to yourself now, when you



<P>have so little teaching to do.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was no use beginning to dispute with such indulged, unreasoning



<P>creatures:&nbsp; so I held my peace.&nbsp; I was accustomed, now, to

keeping



<P>silence when things distasteful to my ear were uttered; and now,



<P>too, I was used to wearing a placid smiling countenance when my



<P>heart was bitter within me.&nbsp; Only those who have felt the like

can



<P>imagine my feelings, as I sat with an assumption of smiling



<P>indifference, listening to the accounts of those meetings and



<P>interviews with Mr. Weston, which they seemed to find such pleasure



<P>in describing to me; and hearing things asserted of him which, from



<P>the character of the man, I knew to be exaggerations and



<P>perversions of the truth, if not entirely false - things derogatory



<P>to him, and flattering to them - especially to Miss Murray - which



<P>I burned to contradict, or, at least, to show my doubts about, but



<P>dared not; lest, in expressing my disbelief, I should display my



<P>interest too.&nbsp; Other things I heard, which I felt or feared were



<P>indeed too true:&nbsp; but I must still conceal my anxiety respecting



<P>him, my indignation against them, beneath a careless aspect;



<P>others, again, mere hints of something said or done, which I longed



<P>to hear more of, but could not venture to inquire.&nbsp; So passed the



<P>weary time.&nbsp; I could not even comfort myself with saying, 'She

will



<P>soon be married; and then there may be hope.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Soon after her marriage the holidays would come; and when I



<P>returned from home, most likely, Mr. Weston would be gone, for I



<P>was told that he and the Rector could not agree (the Rector's



<P>fault, of course), and he was about to remove to another place.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>No - besides my hope in God, my only consolation was in thinking



<P>that, though he know it not, I was more worthy of his love than



<P>Rosalie Murray, charming and engaging as she was; for I could



<P>appreciate his excellence, which she could not:&nbsp; I would devote

my



<P>life to the promotion of his happiness; she would destroy his



<P>happiness for the momentary gratification of her own vanity.&nbsp; 'Oh,



<P>if he could but know the difference!'&nbsp; I would earnestly exclaim.



<P>'But no!&nbsp; I would not have him see my heart:&nbsp; yet, if he could

but



<P>know her hollowness, her worthless, heartless frivolity, he would



<P>then be safe, and I should be - ALMOST happy, though I might never



<P>see him more!'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I fear, by this time, the reader is well nigh disgusted with the



<P>folly and weakness I have so freely laid before him.&nbsp; I never



<P>disclosed it then, and would not have done so had my own sister or



<P>my mother been with me in the house.&nbsp; I was a close and resolute



<P>dissembler - in this one case at least.&nbsp; My prayers, my tears,

my



<P>wishes, fears, and lamentations, were witnessed by myself and



<P>heaven alone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When we are harassed by sorrows or anxieties, or long oppressed by



<P>any powerful feelings which we must keep to ourselves, for which we



<P>can obtain and seek no sympathy from any living creature, and which



<P>yet we cannot, or will not wholly crush, we often naturally seek



<P>relief in poetry - and often find it, too - whether in the



<P>effusions of others, which seem to harmonize with our existing



<P>case, or in our own attempts to give utterance to those thoughts



<P>and feelings in strains less musical, perchance, but more



<P>appropriate, and therefore more penetrating and sympathetic, and,



<P>for the time, more soothing, or more powerful to rouse and to



<P>unburden the oppressed and swollen heart.&nbsp; Before this time, at



<P>Wellwood House and here, when suffering from home-sick melancholy,



<P>I had sought relief twice or thrice at this secret source of



<P>consolation; and now I flew to it again, with greater avidity than



<P>ever, because I seemed to need it more.&nbsp; I still preserve those



<P>relics of past sufferings and experience, like pillars of witness



<P>set up in travelling through the vale of life, to mark particular



<P>occurrences.&nbsp; The footsteps are obliterated now; the face of the



<P>country may be changed; but the pillar is still there, to remind me



<P>how all things were when it was reared.&nbsp; Lest the reader should

be



<P>curious to see any of these effusions, I will favour him with one



<P>short specimen:&nbsp; cold and languid as the lines may seem, it was



<P>almost a passion of grief to which they owed their being:-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Oh, they have robbed me of the hope



<P>My spirit held so dear;



<P>They will not let me hear that voice



<P>My soul delights to hear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They will not let me see that face



<P>I so delight to see;



<P>And they have taken all thy smiles,



<P>And all thy love from me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Well, let them seize on all they can; -



<P>One treasure still is mine, -



<P>A heart that loves to think on thee,



<P>And feels the worth of thine.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Yes, at least, they could not deprive me of that:&nbsp; I could think

of



<P>him day and night; and I could feel that he was worthy to be



<P>thought of.&nbsp; Nobody knew him as I did; nobody could appreciate

him



<P>as I did; nobody could love him as I - could, if I might:&nbsp; but



<P>there was the evil.&nbsp; What business had I to think so much of one



<P>that never thought of me?&nbsp; Was it not foolish? was it not wrong?



<P>Yet, if I found such deep delight in thinking of him, and if I kept



<P>those thoughts to myself, and troubled no one else with them, where



<P>was the harm of it? I would ask myself.&nbsp; And such reasoning



<P>prevented me from making any sufficient effort to shake off my



<P>fetters.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But, if those thoughts brought delight, it was a painful, troubled



<P>pleasure, too near akin to anguish; and one that did me more injury



<P>than I was aware of.&nbsp; It was an indulgence that a person of more



<P>wisdom or more experience would doubtless have denied herself.&nbsp;

And



<P>yet, how dreary to turn my eyes from the contemplation of that



<P>bright object and force them to dwell on the dull, grey, desolate



<P>prospect around:&nbsp; the joyless, hopeless, solitary path that lay



<P>before me.&nbsp; It was wrong to be so joyless, so desponding; I should



<P>have made God my friend, and to do His will the pleasure and the



<P>business of my life; but faith was weak, and passion was too



<P>strong.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In this time of trouble I had two other causes of affliction.&nbsp;

The



<P>first may seem a trifle, but it cost me many a tear:&nbsp; Snap, my



<P>little dumb, rough-visaged, but bright-eyed, warm-hearted



<P>companion, the only thing I had to love me, was taken away, and



<P>delivered over to the tender mercies of the village rat-catcher, a



<P>man notorious for his brutal treatment of his canine slaves.&nbsp; The



<P>other was serious enough; my letters from home gave intimation that



<P>my father's health was worse.&nbsp; No boding fears were expressed,

but



<P>I was grown timid and despondent, and could not help fearing that



<P>some dreadful calamity awaited us there.&nbsp; I seemed to see the black



<P>clouds gathering round my native hills, and to hear the angry



<P>muttering of a storm that was about to burst, and desolate our



<P>hearth.
