<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Custom AND EDUCATION</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>MEN'S thoughts, are much according to their



<P>inclination; their discourse and speeches,



<P>according to their learning and infused opinions;



<P>but their deeds, are after as they have been accus-



<P>tomed.&nbsp; And therefore, as Machiavel well noteth



<P>(though in an evil-favored instance), there is no



<P>trusting to the force of nature, nor to the bravery



<P>of words, except it be corroborate by custom.&nbsp; His



<P>instance is, that for the achieving of a desperate



<P>conspiracy, a man should not rest upon the fierce-



<P>ness of any man's nature, or his resolute under-



<P>takings; but take such an one, as hath had his



<P>hands formerly in blood.&nbsp; But Machiavel knew not



<P>of a Friar Clement, nor a Ravillac, nor a Jaureguy,



<P>nor a Baltazar Gerard; yet his rule holdeth still,



<P>that nature, nor the engagement of words, are not



<P>so forcible, as custom.&nbsp; Only superstition is now so



<P>well advanced, that men of the first blood, are as



<P>firm as butchers by occupation; and votary reso-



<P>lution, is made equipollent to custom, even in mat-



<P>ter of blood.&nbsp; In other things, the predominancy of



<P>custom is everywhere visible; insomuch as a man



<P>would wonder, to hear men profess, protest, en-



<P>gage, give great words, and then do, just as they



<P>have done before; as if they were dead images,



<P>and engines moved only by the wheels of custom.



<P>We see also the reign or tyranny of custom, what



<P>it is.&nbsp; The Indians (I mean the sect of their wise men)



<P>lay themselves quietly upon a stock of wood, and



<P>so sacrifice themselves by fire.&nbsp; Nay, the wives



<P>strive to be burned, with the corpses of their hus-



<P>bands.&nbsp; The lads of Sparta, of ancient time, were



<P>wont to be scourged upon the altar of Diana, with-



<P>out so much as queching.&nbsp; I remember, in the be-



<P>ginning of Queen Elizabeth's time of England, an



<P>Irish rebel condemned, put up a petition to the



<P>deputy, that he might be hanged in a withe, and



<P>not in an halter; because it had been so used, with



<P>former rebels.&nbsp; There be monks in Russia, for pen-



<P>ance, that will sit a whole night in a vessel of water,



<P>till they be engaged with hard ice.&nbsp; Many examples



<P>may be put of the force of custom, both upon mind



<P>and body.&nbsp; Therefore, since custom is the principal



<P>magistrate of man's life, let men by all means en-



<P>deavor, to obtain good customs.&nbsp; Certainly custom



<P>is most perfect, when it beginneth in young years:



<P>this we call education; which is, in effect, but an



<P>early custom.&nbsp; So we see, in languages, the tongue



<P>is more pliant to all expressions and sounds, the



<P>joints are more supple, to all feats of activity and



<P>motions,&nbsp; in youth than afterwards.&nbsp; For it is true,



<P>that late learners cannot so well take the ply; ex-



<P>cept it be in some minds, that have not suffered



<P>themselves to fix, but have kept themselves open,



<P>and prepared to receive continual amendment,



<P>which is exceeding rare.&nbsp; But if the force of cus-



<P>tom simple and separate, be great, the force of



<P>custom copulate and conjoined and collegiate, is



<P>far greater.&nbsp; For there example teacheth, company



<P>comforteth, emulation quickeneth, glory raiseth:



<P>so as in such places the force of custom is in his



<P>exaltation.&nbsp; Certainly the great multiplication of



<P>virtues upon human nature, resteth upon socie-



<P>ties well ordained and disciplined.&nbsp; For common-



<P>wealths, and good governments, do nourish virtue



<P>grown but do not much mend the deeds.&nbsp; But the



<P>misery is, that the most effectual means, are now



<P>applied to the ends, least to be desired.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Usury</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>MANY have made witty invectives against



<P>usury.&nbsp; They say that it is a pity, the devil



<P>should have God's part, which is the tithe.&nbsp; That the



<P>usurer is the greatest Sabbath-breaker, because his



<P>plough goeth every Sunday.&nbsp; That the usurer is the



<P>drone, that Virgil speaketh of;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Ignavum fucos pecus a praesepibus arcent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That the usurer breaketh the first law, that was



<P>made for mankind after the fall, which was, in



<P>sudore vultus tui comedes panem tuum; not, in



<P>sudore vultus alieni.&nbsp; That usurers should have



<P>orange-tawny bonnets, because they do judaize.



<P>That it is against nature for money to beget money;



<P>and the like.&nbsp; I say this only, that usury is a conces-



<P>sum propter duritiem cordis; for since there must



<P>be borrowing and lending, and men are so hard



<P>of heart, as they will not lend freely, usury must



<P>be permitted.&nbsp; Some others, have made suspicious



<P>and cunning propositions of banks, discovery of



<P>men's estates, and other inventions.&nbsp; But few have



<P>spoken of usury usefully.&nbsp; It is good to set before us,



<P>the incommodities and commodities of usury, that



<P>the good, may be either weighed out or culled out;



<P>and warily to provide, that while we make forth



<P>to that which is better, we meet not with that



<P>which is worse.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The discommodities of usury are, First, that it



<P>makes fewer merchants.&nbsp; For were it not for this



<P>lazy trade of usury, money would not he still, but



<P>would in great part be employed upon merchan-



<P>dizing; which is the vena porta of wealth in a state.



<P>The second, that it makes poor merchants.&nbsp; For, as



<P>a farmer cannot husband his ground so well, if he



<P>sit at a great rent; so the merchant cannot drive



<P>his trade so well, if he sit at great usury.&nbsp; The third



<P>is incident to the other two; and that is the decay of



<P>customs of kings or states, which ebb or flow, with



<P>merchandizing.&nbsp; The fourth, that it bringeth the



<P>treasure of a realm, or state, into a few hands.&nbsp; For



<P>the usurer being at certainties, and others at uncer-



<P>tainties, at the end of the game, most of the money



<P>will be in the box; and ever a state flourisheth,



<P>when wealth is more equally spread.&nbsp; The fifth,



<P>that it beats down the price of land; for the em-



<P>ployment of money, is chiefly either merchandiz-



<P>ing or purchasing; and usury waylays both.&nbsp; The



<P>sixth, that it doth dull and damp all industries, im-



<P>provements, and new inventions, wherein money



<P>would be stirring, if it were not for this slug.&nbsp; The



<P>last, that it is the canker and ruin of many men's



<P>estates; which, in process of time, breeds a public



<P>poverty.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On the other side, the commodities of usury are,



<P>first, that howsoever usury in some respect hinder-



<P>eth merchandizing, yet in some other it advanceth



<P>it; for it is certain that the greatest part of trade is



<P>driven by young merchants, upon borrowing at



<P>interest; so as if the usurer either call in, or keep



<P>back, his money, there will ensue, presently, a



<P>great stand of trade.&nbsp; The second is, that were it not



<P>for this easy borrowing upon interest, men's neces-



<P>sities would draw upon them a most sudden un-



<P>doing; in that they would be forced to sell their



<P>means (be it lands or goods) far under foot; and so,



<P>whereas usury doth but gnaw upon them, bad



<P>markets would swallow them quite up.&nbsp; As for



<P>mortgaging or pawning, it will little mend the



<P>matter: for either men will not take pawns with-



<P>out use; or if they do, they will look precisely for



<P>the forfeiture.&nbsp; I remember a cruel moneyed man



<P>in the country, that would say, The devil take this



<P>usury, it keeps us from forfeitures, of mortgages



<P>and bonds.&nbsp; The third and last is, that it is a vanity



<P>to conceive, that there would be ordinary borrow-



<P>ing without profit; and it is impossible to conceive,



<P>the number of inconveniences that will ensue, if



<P>borrowing be cramped.&nbsp; Therefore to speak of the



<P>abolishing of usury is idle.&nbsp; All states have ever had



<P>it, in one kind or rate, or other.&nbsp; So as that opinion



<P>must be sent to Utopia.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To speak now of the reformation, and reigle-



<P>ment, of usury; how the discommodities of it may



<P>be best avoided, and the commodities retained.&nbsp; It



<P>appears, by the balance of commodities and dis-



<P>commodities of usury, two things are to be recon-



<P>ciled.&nbsp; The one, that the tooth of usury be grinded,



<P>that it bite not too much; the other, that there be



<P>left open a means, to invite moneyed men to lend



<P>to the merchants, for the continuing and quicken-



<P>ing of trade.&nbsp; This cannot be done, except you intro-



<P>duce two several sorts of usury, a less and a greater.



<P>For if you reduce usury to one low rate, it will ease



<P>the common borrower, but the merchant will be



<P>to seek for money.&nbsp; And it is to be noted, that the



<P>trade of merchandize, being the most lucrative,



<P>may bear usury at a good rate; other contracts



<P>not so.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To serve both intentions, the way would be



<P>briefly thus.&nbsp; That there be two rates of usury:



<P>the one free, and general for all; the other under



<P>license only, to certain persons, and in certain



<P>places of merchandizing.&nbsp; First, therefore, let usury



<P>in general, be reduced to five in the hundred; and



<P>let that rate be proclaimed, to be free and current;



<P>and let the state shut itself out, to take any penalty



<P>for the same.&nbsp; This will preserve borrowing, from



<P>any general stop or dryness.&nbsp; This will ease infinite



<P>borrowers in the country.&nbsp; This will, in good part,



<P>raise the price of land, because land purchased



<P>at sixteen years' purchase will yield six in the



<P>hundred, and somewhat more; whereas this rate



<P>of interest, yields but five.&nbsp; This by like reason



<P>will encourage, and edge, industrious and profit-



<P>able improvements; because many will rather



<P>venture in that kind, than take five in the hun-



<P>dred, especially having been used to greater profit.



<P>Secondly, let there be certain persons licensed,



<P>to lend to known merchants, upon usury at a



<P>higher rate; and let it be with the cautions fol-



<P>lowing.&nbsp; Let the rate be, even with the merchant



<P>himself, somewhat more easy than that he used



<P>formerly to pay; for by that means, all bor-



<P>rowers, shall have some ease by this reformation,



<P>be he merchant, or whosoever.&nbsp; Let it be no



<P>bank or common stock, but every man be master



<P>of his own money.&nbsp; Not that I altogether mis-



<P>like banks, but they will hardly be brooked, in



<P>regard of certain suspicions.&nbsp; Let the state be



<P>answered some small matter for the license, and



<P>the rest left to the lender; for if the abatement be



<P>but small, it will no whit discourage the lender.



<P>For he, for example, that took before ten or nine in



<P>the hundred, will sooner descend to eight in the



<P>hundred than give over his trade of usury, and go



<P>from certain gains, to gains of hazard.&nbsp; Let these



<P>licensed lenders be in number indefinite, but re-



<P>strained to certain principal cities and towns of



<P>merchandizing; for then they will be hardly able



<P>to color other men's moneys in the country: so as



<P>the license of nine will not suck away the current



<P>rate of five; for no man will send his moneys far



<P>off, nor put them into unknown hands.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If it be objected that this doth in a sort authorize



<P>usury, which before, was in some places but per-



<P>missive; the answer is, that it is better to mitigate



<P>usury, by declaration, than to suffer it to rage, by



<P>connivance.

   <TITLE>Of Judicature</TITLE>

</HEAD>

<BODY>

&nbsp;



<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Judicature</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>JUDGES ought to remember, that their office is



<P>jus dicere, and not jus dare; to interpret law,



<P>and not to make law, or give law.&nbsp; Else will it be



<P>like the authority, claimed by the Church of Rome,



<P>which under pretext of exposition of Scripture,



<P>doth not stick to add and alter; and to pronounce



<P>that which they do not find; and by show of an-



<P>tiquity, to introduce novelty.&nbsp; Judges ought to be



<P>more learned, than witty, more reverend, than



<P>plausible,and more advised, than confident.&nbsp; Above



<P>all things, integrity is their portion and proper



<P>virtue.&nbsp; Cursed (saith the law) is he that removeth



<P>the landmark.&nbsp; The mislayer of a mere-stone is to



<P>blame.&nbsp; But it is the unjust judge, that is the capital



<P>remover of landmarks, when he defineth amiss, of



<P>lands and property.&nbsp; One foul sentence doth more



<P>hurt, than many foul examples.&nbsp; For these do but



<P>corrupt the stream, the other corrupteth the foun-



<P>tain.&nbsp; So with Solomon, Fons turbatus, et vena



<P>corrupta, est justus cadens in causa sua coram



<P>adversario.&nbsp; The office of judges may have reference



<P>unto the parties that use, unto the advocates that



<P>plead, unto the clerks and ministers of justice



<P>underneath them, and to the sovereign or state



<P>above them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>First, for the causes or parties that sue.&nbsp; There be



<P>(saith the Scripture) that turn judgment, into



<P>wormwood; and surely there be also, that turn it



<P>into vinegar; for injustice maketh it bitter, and



<P>delays make it sour.&nbsp; The principal duty of a judge,



<P>is to suppress force and fraud; whereof force is the



<P>more pernicious, when it is open, and fraud, when



<P>it is close and disguised.&nbsp; Add thereto contentious



<P>suits, which ought to be spewed out, as the surfeit



<P>of courts.&nbsp; A judge ought to prepare his way to a



<P>just sentence, as God useth to prepare his way, by



<P>raising valleys and taking down hills: so when



<P>there appeareth on either side an high hand, vio-



<P>lent prosecution, cunning advantages taken, com-



<P>bination, power, great counsel, then is the virtue



<P>of a judge seen, to make inequality equal; that he



<P>may plant his judgment as upon an even ground.



<P>Qui fortiter emungit, elicit sanguinem; and where



<P>the wine-press is hard wrought, it yields a harsh



<P>wine, that tastes of the grape-stone.&nbsp; Judges must



<P>beware of hard constructions, and strained infer-



<P>ences; for there is no worse torture, than the tor-



<P>ture of laws.&nbsp; Specially in case of laws penal, they



<P>ought to have care, that that which was meant for



<P>terror, be not turned into rigor; and that they



<P>bring not upon the people, that shower whereof



<P>the Scripture speaketh, Pluet super eos laqueos;



<P>for penal laws pressed, are a shower of snares upon



<P>the people.&nbsp; Therefore let penal laws, if they have



<P>been sleepers of long, or if they be grown unfit for



<P>the present time, be by wise judges confined in the



<P>execution: Judicis officium est, ut res, ita tempora



<P>rerum, etc.&nbsp; In causes of life and death, judges ought



<P>(as far as the law permitteth) in justice to remem-



<P>ber mercy; and to cast a severe eye upon the



<P>example, but a merciful eye upon the person.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Secondly, for the advocates and counsel that



<P>plead.&nbsp; Patience and gravity of hearing, is an essen-



<P>tial part of justice; and an overspeaking judge is no



<P>well-tuned cymbal.&nbsp; It is no grace to a judge, first



<P>to find that, which he might have heard in due



<P>time from the bar; or to show quickness of conceit,



<P>in cutting off evidence or counsel too short; or to



<P>prevent information by questions, though perti-



<P>nent.&nbsp; The parts of a judge in hearing, are four: to



<P>direct the evidence; to moderate length, repetition,



<P>or impertinency of speech; to recapitulate, select,



<P>and collate the material points, of that which hath



<P>been said; and to give the rule or sentence.&nbsp; What-



<P>soever is above these is too much; and proceedeth



<P>either of glory, and willingness to speak, or of im-



<P>patience to hear, or of shortness of memory, or of



<P>want of a staid and equal attention.&nbsp; It is a strange



<P>thing to see, that the boldness of advocates should



<P>prevail with judges; whereas they should imitate



<P>God, in whose seat they sit; who represseth the pre-



<P>sumptuous, and giveth grace to the modest.&nbsp; But it



<P>is more strange, that judges should have noted



<P>favorites; which cannot but cause multiplication



<P>of fees, and suspicion of by-ways.&nbsp; There is due from



<P>the judge to the advocate, some commendation



<P>and gracing, where causes are well handled and



<P>fair pleaded; especially towards the side which



<P>obtaineth not; for that upholds in the client, the



<P>reputation of his counsel, and beats down in him



<P>the conceit of his cause.&nbsp; There is likewise due to the



<P>public, a civil reprehension of advocates, where



<P>there appeareth cunning counsel, gross neglect,



<P>slight information, indiscreet pressing, or an over-



<P>bold defence.&nbsp; And let not the counsel at the bar,



<P>chop with the judge, nor wind himself into the



<P>handling of the cause anew, after the judge hath



<P>declared his sentence; but, on the other side, let



<P>not the judge meet the cause half way, nor give



<P>occasion to the party, to say his counsel or proofs



<P>were not heard.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Thirdly, for that that concerns clerks and minis-



<P>ters.&nbsp; The place of justice is an hallowed place; and



<P>therefore not only the bench, but the foot-place;



<P>and precincts and purprise thereof, ought to be



<P>preserved without scandal and corruption.&nbsp; For



<P>certainly grapes (as the Scripture saith) will not



<P>be gathered of thorns or thistles; either can justice



<P>yield her fruit with sweetness, amongst the briars



<P>and brambles of catching and polling clerks, and



<P>ministers.&nbsp; The attendance of courts, is subject to



<P>four bad instruments.&nbsp; First, certain persons that



<P>are sowers of suits; which make the court swell,



<P>and the country pine.&nbsp; The second sort is of those,



<P>that engage courts in quarrels of jurisdiction, and



<P>are not truly amici curiae, but parasiti curiae, in



<P>puffing a court up beyond her bounds, for their



<P>own scraps and advantage.&nbsp; The third sort, is of



<P>those that may be accounted the left hands of



<P>courts; persons that are full of nimble and sinister



<P>tricks and shifts, whereby they pervert the plain



<P>and direct courses of courts, and bring justice into



<P>oblique lines and labyrinths.&nbsp; And the fourth, is the



<P>poller and exacter of fees; which justifies the com-



<P>mon resemblance of the courts of justice, to the



<P>bush whereunto, while the sheep flies for defence



<P>in weather, he is sure to lose part of his fleece.&nbsp; On



<P>the other side, an ancient clerk, skilful in prece-



<P>dents, wary in proceeding, and understanding in



<P>the business of the court, is an excellent finger of



<P>a court; and doth many times point the way to the



<P>judge himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Fourthly, for that which may concern the sov-



<P>ereign and estate.&nbsp; Judges ought above all to re-



<P>member the conclusion of the Roman Twelve



<P>Tables; Salus populi suprema lex; and to know



<P>that laws, except they be in order to that end, are



<P>but things captious, and oracles not well inspired.



<P>Therefore it is an happy thing in a state, when



<P>kings and states do often consult with judges; and



<P>again, when judges do often consult with the king



<P>and state: the one, when there is matter of law,



<P>intervenient in business of state; the other, when



<P>there is some consideration of state, intervenient



<P>in matter of law.&nbsp; For many times the things de-



<P>duced to judgment may be meum and tuum, when



<P>the reason and consequence thereof may trench to



<P>point of estate: I call matter of estate, not only the



<P>parts of sovereignty, but whatsoever introduceth



<P>any great alteration, or dangerous precedent; or



<P>concerneth manifestly any great portion of peo-



<P>ple.&nbsp; And let no man weakly conceive, that just



<P>laws and true policy have any antipathy; for they



<P>are like the spirits and sinews, that one moves with



<P>the other.&nbsp; Let judges also remember, that Solo-



<P>mon's throne was supported by lions on both sides:



<P>let them be lions, but yet lions under the throne;



<P>being circumspect that they do not check or oppose



<P>any points of sovereignty.&nbsp; Let not judges also be



<P>ignorant of their own right, as to think there is not



<P>left to them, as a principal part of their office, a



<P>wise use and application of laws.&nbsp; For they may



<P>remember, what the apostle saith of a greater law



<P>than theirs; Nos scimus quia lex bona est, modo



<P>quis ea utatur legitime.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>HOUSES are built to live in, and not to look on;



<P>therefore let use be preferred before uni-



<P>formity, except where both may be had.&nbsp; Leave



<P>the goodly fabrics of houses, for beauty only, to



<P>the enchanted palaces of the poets; who build them



<P>with small cost.&nbsp; He that builds a fair house, upon



<P>an ill seat, committeth himself to prison.&nbsp; Neither



<P>do I reckon it an ill seat, only where the air is un-



<P>wholesome; but likewise where the air is unequal;



<P>as you shall see many fine seats set upon a knap of



<P>ground, environed with higher hills round about



<P>it; whereby the heat of the sun is pent in, and the



<P>wind gathereth as in troughs; so as you shall have,



<P>and that suddenly, as great diversity of heat and



<P>cold as if you dwelt in several places.&nbsp; Neither is it



<P>ill air only that maketh an ill seat, but ill ways, ill



<P>markets; and, if you will consult with Momus, ill



<P>neighbors.&nbsp; I speak not of many more; want of



<P>water; want of wood, shade, and shelter; want of



<P>fruitfulness, and mixture of grounds of several



<P>natures; want of prospect; want of level grounds;



<P>want of places at some near distance for sports of



<P>hunting, hawking, and races; too near the sea, too



<P>remote; having the commodity of navigable rivers,



<P>or the discommodity of their overflowing; too far



<P>off from great cities, which may hinder business,



<P>or too near them, which lurcheth all provisions,



<P>and maketh everything dear; where a man hath



<P>a great living laid together, and where he is



<P>scanted: all which, as it is impossible perhaps to



<P>find together, so it is good to know them, and think



<P>of them, that a man may take as many as he can;



<P>and if he have several dwellings, that he sort them



<P>so&nbsp; that what he wanteth in the one, he may find in



<P>the other.&nbsp; Lucullus answered Pompey well; who,



<P>when he saw his stately galleries, and rooms so



<P>large and lightsome, in one of his houses, said,



<P>Surely an excellent place for summer, but how do



<P>you in winter? Lucullus answered, Why, do you



<P>not think me as wise as some fowl are, that ever



<P>change their abode towards the winter?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To pass from the seat, to the house itself; we will



<P>do as Cicero doth in the orator's art; who writes



<P>books De Oratore, and a book he entitles Orator;



<P>whereof the former, delivers the precepts of the



<P>art, and the latter, the perfection.&nbsp; We will there-



<P>fore describe a princely palace, making a brief



<P>model thereof.&nbsp; For it is strange to see, now in



<P>Europe, such huge buildings as the Vatican and



<P>Escurial and some others be, and yet scarce a very



<P>fair room in them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>First, therefore, I say you cannot have a perfect



<P>palace except you have two several sides; a side for



<P>the banquet, as it is spoken of in the book of Hester,



<P>and a side for the household; the one for feasts and



<P>triumphs, and the other for dwelling.&nbsp; I understand



<P>both these sides to be not only returns, but parts



<P>of the front; and to be uniform without, though



<P>severally partitioned within; and to be on both



<P>sides of a great and stately tower, in the midst of



<P>the front, that, as it were, joineth them together



<P>on either hand.&nbsp; I would have on the side of the ban-



<P>quet, in front, one only goodly room above stairs,



<P>of some forty foot high; and under it a room for a



<P>dressing, or preparing place, at times of triumphs.



<P>On the other side, which is the household side, I



<P>wish it divided at the first, into a hall and a chapel



<P>(with a partition between); both of good state and



<P>bigness; and those not to go all the length, but to



<P>have at the further end, a winter and a summer



<P>parlor, both fair.&nbsp; And under these rooms, a fair



<P>and large cellar, sunk under ground; and likewise



<P>some privy kitchens, with butteries and pantries,



<P>and the like.&nbsp; As for the tower, I would have it two



<P>stories, of eighteen foot high apiece, above the two



<P>wings; and a goodly leads upon the top,railed with



<P>statuas interposed; and the same tower to be di-



<P>vided into rooms, as shall be thought fit.&nbsp; The stairs



<P>likewise to the upper rooms, let them be upon a



<P>fair open newel, and finely railed in, with images



<P>of wood, cast into a brass color; and a very fair



<P>landing-place at the top.&nbsp; But this to be, if you do



<P>not point any of the lower rooms, for a dining place



<P>of servants.&nbsp; For otherwise, you shall have the ser-



<P>vants' dinner after your own: for the steam of it,



<P>will come up as in a tunnel.&nbsp; And so much for the



<P>front.&nbsp; Only I understand the height of the first



<P>stairs to be sixteen foot, which is the height of the



<P>lower room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Beyond this front, is there to be a fair court, but



<P>three sides of it, of a far lower building than the



<P>front.&nbsp; And in all the four corners of that court, fair



<P>staircases, cast into turrets, on the outside, and not



<P>within the row of buildings themselves.&nbsp; But those



<P>towers, are not to be of the height of the front, but



<P>rather proportionable to the lower building.&nbsp; Let



<P>the court not be paved, for that striketh up a great



<P>heat in summer, and much cold in winter.&nbsp; But



<P>only some side alleys, with a cross, and the quar-



<P>ters to graze, being kept shorn, but not too near



<P>shorn.&nbsp; The row of return on the banquet side, let it



<P>be all stately galleries: in which galleries let there



<P>be three, or five, fine cupolas in the length of it,



<P>placed at equal distance; and fine colored windows



<P>of several works.&nbsp; On the household side, chambers



<P>of presence and ordinary entertainments, with



<P>some bed-chambers; and let all three sides be a



<P>double house, without thorough lights on the sides,



<P>that you may have rooms from the sun, both for



<P>forenoon and afternoon.&nbsp; Cast it also, that you may



<P>have rooms, both for summer and winter; shady



<P>for summer, and warm for winter.&nbsp; You shall have



<P>sometimes fair houses so full of glass, that one can-



<P>not tell where to become, to be out of the sun or



<P>cold.&nbsp; For inbowed windows, I hold them of good



<P>use (in cities, indeed, upright do better, in respect



<P>of the uniformity towards the street); for they be



<P>pretty retiring places for conference; and besides,



<P>they keep both the wind and sun off; for that



<P>which would strike almost through the room, doth



<P>scarce pass the window.&nbsp; But let them be but few,



<P>four in the court, on the sides only.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Beyond this court, let there be an inward court,



<P>of the same square and height; which is to be en-



<P>vironed with the garden on all sides; and in the



<P>inside, cloistered on all sides, upon decent and



<P>beautiful arches, as high as the first story.&nbsp; On the



<P>under story, towards the garden, let it be turned



<P>to a grotto, or a place of shade, or estivation.&nbsp; And



<P>only have opening and windows towards the gar-



<P>den; and be level upon the floor, no whit sunken



<P>under ground, to avoid all dampishness.&nbsp; And let



<P>there be a fountain, or some fair work of statuas, in



<P>the midst of this court; and to be paved as the other



<P>court was.&nbsp; These buildings to be for privy lodgings



<P>on both sides; and the end for privy galleries.



<P>Whereof you must foresee that one of them be for



<P>an infirmary, if the prince or any special person



<P>should be sick, with chambers, bed-chamber, ante-



<P>camera, and recamera joining to it.&nbsp; This upon the



<P>second story.&nbsp; Upon the ground story, a fair gallery,



<P>open, upon pillars; and upon the third story like-



<P>wise, an open gallery, upon pillars, to take the



<P>prospect and freshness of the garden.&nbsp; At both cor-



<P>ners of the further side, by way of return, let there



<P>be two delicate or rich cabinets, daintily paved,



<P>richly hanged, glazed with crystalline glass, and



<P>a rich cupola in the midst; and all other elegancy



<P>that may be thought upon.&nbsp; In the upper gallery



<P>too, I wish that there may be, if the place will yield



<P>it, some fountains running in divers places from



<P>the wall, with some fine avoidances.&nbsp; And thus



<P>much for the model of the palace; save that you



<P>must have, before you come to the front, three



<P>courts.&nbsp; A green court plain, with a wall about it;



<P>a second court of the same, but more garnished,



<P>with little turrets, or rather embellishments, upon



<P>the wall; and a third court, to make a square with



<P>the front, but not to be built, nor yet enclosed with



<P>a naked wall, but enclosed with terraces, leaded



<P>aloft, and fairly garnished, on the three sides; and



<P>cloistered on the inside, with pillars, and not with



<P>arches below.&nbsp; As for offices, let them stand at dis-



<P>tance, with some low galleries, to pass from them



<P>to the palace itself.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Adversity</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>IT WAS an high speech of Seneca (after the



<P>manner of the Stoics), that the good things,



<P>which belong to prosperity, are to be wished; but



<P>the good things, that belong to adversity, are to be



<P>admired.&nbsp; Bona rerum secundarum optabilia; ad-



<P>versarum mirabilia.&nbsp; Certainly if miracles be the



<P>command over nature, they appear most in adver-



<P>sity.&nbsp; It is yet a higher speech of his, than the other



<P>(much too high for a heathen), It is true greatness,



<P>to have in one the frailty of a man, and the security



<P>of a God.&nbsp; Vere magnum habere fragilitatem homi-



<P>nis, securitatem Dei.&nbsp; This would have done better



<P>in poesy, where transcendences are more allowed.



<P>And the poets indeed have been busy with it; for



<P>it is in effect the thing, which figured in that



<P>strange fiction of the ancient poets, which seemeth



<P>not to be without mystery; nay, and to have some



<P>approach to the state of a Christian; that Hercules,



<P>when he went to unbind Prometheus (by whom



<P>human nature is represented), sailed the length of



<P>the great ocean, in an earthen pot or pitcher; lively



<P>describing Christian resolution, that saileth in the



<P>frail bark of the flesh, through the waves of the



<P>world.&nbsp; But to speak in a mean.&nbsp; The virtue of pros-



<P>perity, is temperance; the virtue of adversity, is



<P>fortitude; which in morals is the more heroical



<P>virtue.&nbsp; Prosperity is the blessing of the Old Testa-



<P>ment; adversity is the blessing of the New; which



<P>carrieth the greater benediction, and the clearer



<P>revelation of God's favor.&nbsp; Yet even in the Old



<P>Testament, if you listen to David's harp, you shall



<P>hear as many hearse-like airs as carols; and the



<P>pencil of the Holy Ghost hath labored more in de-



<P>scribing the afflictions of Job, than the felicities of



<P>Solomon.&nbsp; Prosperity is not without many fears



<P>and distastes; and adversity is not without com-



<P>forts and hopes.&nbsp; We see in needle-works and em-



<P>broideries, it is more pleasing to have a lively work,



<P>upon a sad and solemn ground, than to have a dark



<P>and melancholy work, upon a lightsome ground:



<P>judge therefore of the pleasure of the heart, by the



<P>pleasure of the eye.&nbsp; Certainly virtue is like precious



<P>odors, most fragrant when they are incensed, or



<P>crushed: for prosperity doth best discover vice, but



<P>adversity doth best discover virtue.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Gardens</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>G0D Almighty first planted a garden.&nbsp; And



<P>indeed it is the purest of human pleasures.



<P>It is the greatest refreshment to the spirits of man;



<P>without which, buildings and palaces are but



<P>gross handiworks; and a man shall ever see, that



<P>when ages grow to civility and elegancy, men



<P>come to build stately sooner than to garden finely;



<P>as if gardening were the greater perfection.&nbsp; I do



<P>hold it, in the royal ordering of gardens, there



<P>ought to be gardens, for all the months in the year;



<P>in which severally things of beauty may be then



<P>in season.&nbsp; For December, and January, and the



<P>latter part of November, you must take such things



<P>as are green all winter: holly; ivy; bays; juniper;



<P>cypress-trees; yew; pine-apple-trees; fir-trees;



<P>rosemary; lavender; periwinkle, the white, the



<P>purple, and the blue; germander; flags; orange-



<P>trees; lemon-trees; and myrtles, if they be stoved;



<P>and sweet marjoram, warm set.&nbsp; There followeth,



<P>for the latter part of January and February, the



<P>mezereon-tree, which then blossoms; crocus ver-



<P>nus, both the yellow and the grey; primroses,



<P>anemones; the early tulippa; hyacinthus orien-



<P>talis; chamairis; fritellaria.&nbsp; For March, there



<P>come violets, specially the single blue, which are



<P>the earliest; the yellow daffodil; the daisy; the



<P>almond-tree in blossom; the peach-tree in blos-



<P>som; the cornelian-tree in blossom; sweet-briar.



<P>In April follow the double white violet; the wall-



<P>flower; the stock-gilliflower; the cowslip; flower-



<P>delices, and lilies of all natures; rosemary-flowers;



<P>the tulippa; the double peony; the pale daffodil;



<P>the French honeysuckle; the cherry-tree in blos-



<P>som; the damson and plum-trees in blossom; the



<P>white thorn in leaf; the lilac-tree.&nbsp; In May and



<P>June come pinks of all sorts, specially the blush-



<P>pink; roses of all kinds, except the musk, which



<P>comes later; honeysuckles; strawberries; bugloss;



<P>columbine; the French marigold, flos Africanus;



<P>cherry-tree in fruit; ribes; figs in fruit; rasps; vine-



<P>flowers; lavender in flowers; the sweet satyrian,



<P>with the white flower; herba muscaria; lilium



<P>convallium; the apple-tree in blossom.&nbsp; In July



<P>come gilliflowers of all varieties; musk-roses; the



<P>lime-tree in blossom; early pears and plums in



<P>fruit; jennetings, codlins.&nbsp; In August come plums



<P>of all sorts in fruit; pears; apricocks; berberries;



<P>filberds; musk-melons; monks-hoods, of all colors.



<P>In September come grapes; apples; poppies of



<P>all colors; peaches; melocotones; nectarines; cor-



<P>nelians; wardens; quinces.&nbsp; In October and the



<P>beginning of November come services; medlars;



<P>bullaces; roses cut or removed to come late; holly-



<P>hocks; and such like.&nbsp; These particulars are for the



<P>climate of London; but my meaning is perceived,



<P>that you may have ver perpetuum, as the place



<P>affords.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And because the breath of flowers is far sweeter



<P>in the air (where it comes and goes like the warb-



<P>ling of music) than in the hand, therefore nothing



<P>is more fit for that delight, than to know what be



<P>the flowers and plants that do best perfume the air.



<P>Roses, damask and red, are fast flowers of their



<P>smells; so that you may walk by a whole row of



<P>them, and find nothing of their sweetness; yea



<P>though it be in a morning's dew.&nbsp; Bays likewise



<P>yield no smell as they grow.&nbsp; Rosemary little; nor



<P>sweet marjoram.&nbsp; That which above all others



<P>yields the sweetest smell in the air is the violet,



<P>specially the white double violet, which comes



<P>twice a year; about the middle of April, and about



<P>Bartholomew-tide.&nbsp; Next to that is the musk-rose.



<P>Then the strawberry-leaves dying, which yield a



<P>most excellent cordial smell.&nbsp; Then the flower of



<P>vines; it is a little dust, like the dust of a bent, which



<P>grows upon the cluster in the first coming forth.



<P>Then sweet-briar.&nbsp; Then wall-flowers, which are



<P>very delightful to be set under a parlor or lower



<P>chamber window.&nbsp; Then pinks and gilliflowers,



<P>especially the matted pink and clove gilliflower.



<P>Then the flowers of the lime-tree.&nbsp; Then the honey-



<P>suckles, so they be somewhat afar off.&nbsp; Of bean-



<P>flowers I speak not, because they are field flowers.



<P>But those which perfume the air most delightfully,



<P>not passed by as the rest, but being trodden upon



<P>and crushed, are three; that is, burnet, wild-



<P>thyme, and watermints.&nbsp; Therefore you are to set



<P>whole alleys of them, to have the pleasure when



<P>you walk or tread.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For gardens (speaking of those which are indeed



<P>princelike, as we have done of buildings), the con-



<P>tents ought not well to be under thirty acres of



<P>ground; and to be divided into three parts; a green



<P>in the entrance; a heath or desert in the going



<P>forth; and the main garden in the midst; besides



<P>alleys on both sides.&nbsp; And I like well that four acres



<P>of ground be assigned to the green; six to the



<P>heath; four and four to either side; and twelve to



<P>the main garden.&nbsp; The green hath two pleasures:



<P>the one, because nothing is more pleasant to the



<P>eye than green grass kept finely shorn; the other,



<P>because it will give you a fair alley in the midst, by



<P>which you may go in front upon a stately hedge,



<P>which is to enclose the garden.&nbsp; But because the



<P>alley will be long, and, in great heat of the year or



<P>day, you ought not to buy the shade in the garden,



<P>by going in the sun through the green, therefore



<P>you are, of either side the green, to plant a covert



<P>alley upon carpenter's work, about twelve foot in



<P>height, by which you may go in shade into the



<P>garden.&nbsp; As for the making of knots or figures, with



<P>divers colored earths,&nbsp; that they may lie under the



<P>windows of the house on that side which the gar-



<P>den stands, they be but toys; you may see as good



<P>sights, many times, in tarts.&nbsp; The garden is best to



<P>be square, encompassed on all the four sides with



<P>a stately arched hedge.&nbsp; The arches to be upon pil-



<P>lars of carpenter's work, of some ten foot high, and



<P>six foot broad; and the spaces between of the same



<P>dimension with the breadth of the arch.&nbsp; Over the



<P>arches let there be an entire hedge of some four



<P>foot high, framed also upon carpenter's work; and



<P>upon the upper hedge, over every arch, a little tur-



<P>ret, with a belly, enough to receive a cage of birds:



<P>and over every space between the arches some



<P>other little figure, with broad plates of round col-



<P>ored glass gilt, for the sun to play upon.&nbsp; But this



<P>hedge I intend to be raised upon a bank, not steep,



<P>but gently slope, of some six foot, set all with



<P>flowers.&nbsp; Also I understand, that this square of the



<P>garden, should not be the whole breadth of the



<P>ground, but to leave on either side, ground enough



<P>for diversity of side alleys; unto which the two



<P>covert alleys of the green, may deliver you.&nbsp; But



<P>there must be no alleys with hedges, at either end



<P>of this great enclosure; not at the hither end, for



<P>letting your prospect upon this fair hedge from



<P>the green; nor at the further end, for letting your



<P>prospect from the hedge, through the arches upon



<P>the heath.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For the ordering of the ground, within the great



<P>hedge, I leave it to variety of device; advising



<P>nevertheless, that whatsoever form you cast it into,



<P>first, it be not too busy, or full of work.&nbsp; Wherein I,



<P>for my part, do not like images cut out in juniper



<P>or other garden stuff; they be for children.&nbsp; Little



<P>low hedges, round, like welts, with some pretty



<P>pyramids, I like well; and in some places, fair



<P>columns upon frames of carpenter's work.&nbsp; I would



<P>also have the alleys, spacious and fair.&nbsp; You may



<P>have closer alleys, upon the side grounds, but none



<P>in the main garden.&nbsp; I wish also, in the very middle,



<P>a fair mount, with three ascents, and alleys,



<P>enough for four to walk abreast; which I would



<P>have to be perfect circles, without any bulwarks



<P>or embossments; and the whole mount to be thirty



<P>foot high; and some fine banqueting-house, with



<P>some chimneys neatly cast, and without too much



<P>glass.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For fountains, they are a great beauty and re-



<P>freshment; but pools mar all, and make the garden



<P>unwholesome, and full of flies and frogs.&nbsp; Foun-



<P>tains I intend to be of two natures: the one that



<P>sprinkleth or spouteth water; the other a fair re-



<P>ceipt of water, of some thirty or forty foot square,



<P>but without fish, or slime, or mud.&nbsp; For the first,



<P>the ornaments of images gilt, or of marble, which



<P>are in use, do well: but the main matter is so to



<P>convey the water, as it never stay, either in the



<P>bowls or in the cistern; that the water be never by



<P>rest discolored, green or red or the like; or gather



<P>any mossiness or putrefaction.&nbsp; Besides that, it is to



<P>be cleansed every day by the hand.&nbsp; Also some



<P>steps up to it, and some fine pavement about it,



<P>doth well.&nbsp; As for the other kind of fountain, which



<P>we may call a bathing pool, it may admit much



<P>curiosity and beauty; wherewith we will not



<P>trouble ourselves: as, that the bottom be finely



<P>paved, and with images; the sides likewise; and



<P>withal embellished with colored glass, and such



<P>things of lustre; encompassed also with fine rails



<P>of low statuas.&nbsp; But the main point is the same



<P>which we mentioned in the former kind of foun-



<P>tain; which is, that the water be in perpetual



<P>motion, fed by a water higher than the pool, and



<P>delivered into it by fair spouts, and then dis-



<P>charged away under ground, by some equality of



<P>bores, that it stay little.&nbsp; And for fine devices, of



<P>arching water without spilling, and making it rise



<P>in several forms (of feathers, drinking glasses,



<P>canopies, and the like), they be pretty things to



<P>look on, but nothing to health and sweetness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For the heath, which was the third part of our



<P>plot, I wish it to be framed, as much as may be, to



<P>a natural wildness.&nbsp; Trees I would have none in it,



<P>but some thickets made only of sweet-briar and



<P>honeysuckle, and some wild vine amongst; and



<P>the ground set with violets, strawberries, and



<P>primroses.&nbsp; For these are sweet, and prosper in the



<P>shade.&nbsp; And these to be in the heath, here and there,



<P>not in any order.&nbsp; I like also little heaps, in the na-



<P>ture of mole-hills (such as are in wild heaths), to



<P>be set, some with wild thyme; some with pinks;



<P>some with germander, that gives a good flower to



<P>the eye; some with periwinkle; some with violets;



<P>some with strawberries; some&nbsp; with cowslips; some



<P>with daisies; some with red roses; some with lilium



<P>convallium; some with sweet-williams red; some



<P>with bear's-foot: and the like low flowers, being



<P>withal sweet and sightly.&nbsp; Part of which heaps, are



<P>to be with standards of little bushes pricked upon



<P>their top, and part without.&nbsp; The standards to be



<P>roses; juniper; holly; berberries (but here and



<P>there, because of the smell of their blossoms); red



<P>currants; gooseberries; rosemary; bays; sweet-



<P>briar; and such like.&nbsp; But these standards to be kept



<P>with cutting, that they grow not out of course.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For the side grounds, you are to fill them with



<P>variety of alleys, private, to give a full shade, some



<P>of them, wheresoever the sun be.&nbsp; You are to frame



<P>some of them, likewise, for shelter, that when the



<P>wind blows sharp you may walk as in a gallery.



<P>And those alleys must be likewise hedged at both



<P>ends, to keep out the wind; and these closer alleys



<P>must be ever finely gravelled, and no grass, be-



<P>cause of going wet.&nbsp; In many of these alleys, like-



<P>wise, you are to set fruit-trees of all sorts; as well



<P>upon the walls, as in ranges.&nbsp; And this would be



<P>generally observed, that the borders wherein you



<P>plant your fruit-trees, be fair and large, and low,



<P>and not steep; and set with fine flowers, but thin



<P>and sparingly, lest they deceive the trees.&nbsp; At the



<P>end of both the side grounds, I would have a mount



<P>of some pretty height, leaving the wall of the en-



<P>closure breast high, to look abroad into the fields.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For the main garden, I do not deny, but there



<P>should be some fair alleys ranged on both sides,



<P>with fruit-trees; and some pretty tufts of fruit-



<P>trees, and arbors with seats, set in some decent



<P>order; but these to be by no means set too thick; but



<P>to leave the main garden so as it be not close, but



<P>the air open and free.&nbsp; For as for shade, I would



<P>have you rest upon the alleys of the side grounds,



<P>there to walk, if you be disposed, in the heat of the



<P>year or day; but to make account, that the main



<P>garden is for the more temperate parts of the year;



<P>and in the heat of summer, for the morning and



<P>the evening, or overcast days.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For aviaries, I like them not, except they be of



<P>that largeness as they may be turfed, and have



<P>living plants and bushes set in them; that the birds



<P>may have more scope, and natural nesting, and



<P>that no foulness appear in the floor of the aviary.



<P>So I have made a platform of a princely garden,



<P>partly by precept, partly by drawing, not a model,



<P>but some general lines of it; and in this I have



<P>spared for no cost.&nbsp; But it is nothing for great



<P>princes, that for the most part taking advice with



<P>workmen, with no less cost set their things to-



<P>gether; and sometimes add statuas and such things



<P>for state and magnificence, but nothing to the true



<P>pleasure of a garden.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>IT WERE better to have no opinion of God at all,



<P>than such an opinion, as is unworthy of him.



<P>For the one is unbelief, the other is contumely;



<P>and certainly superstition is the reproach of the



<P>Deity.&nbsp; Plutarch saith well to that purpose: Surely



<P>(saith he) I had rather a great deal, men should



<P>say, there was no such man at all, as Plutarch,



<P>than that they should say, that there was one Plu-



<P>tarch, that would eat his children as soon as they



<P>were born; as the poets speak of Saturn.&nbsp; And as the



<P>contumely is greater towards God, so the danger is



<P>greater towards men.&nbsp; Atheism leaves a man to



<P>sense, to philosophy, to natural piety, to laws, to



<P>reputation; all which may be guides to an outward



<P>moral virtue, though religion were not; but super-



<P>stition dismounts all these, and erecteth an abso-



<P>lute monarchy, in the minds of men.&nbsp; Therefore



<P>theism did never perturb states; for it makes men



<P>wary of themselves, as looking no further: and we



<P>see the times inclined to atheism (as the time of



<P>Augustus Caesar) were civil times.&nbsp; But supersti-



<P>tion hath been the confusion of many states, and



<P>bringeth in a new primum mobile, that ravisheth



<P>all the spheres of government.The master of super-



<P>stition, is the people; and in all superstition, wise



<P>men follow fools; and arguments are fitted to prac-



<P>tice, in a reversed order.&nbsp; It was gravely said by



<P>some of the prelates in the Council of Trent, where



<P>the doctrine of the Schoolmen bare great sway,



<P>that the Schoolmen were like astronomers, which



<P>did feign eccentrics and epicycles, and such en-



<P>gines of orbs, to save the phenomena; though they



<P>knew there were no such things; and in like man-



<P>ner, that the Schoolmen had framed a number of



<P>subtle and intricate axioms, and theorems, to save



<P>the practice of the church.&nbsp; The causes of supersti-



<P>tion are: pleasing and sensual rites and ceremonies;



<P>excess of outward and pharisaical holiness; over-



<P>great reverence of traditions, which cannot but



<P>load the church; the stratagems of prelates, for



<P>their own ambition and lucre; the favoring too



<P>much of good intentions, which openeth the gate



<P>to conceits and novelties; the taking an aim at



<P>divine matters, by human, which cannot but



<P>breed mixture of imaginations: and, lastly, bar-



<P>barous times, especially joined with calamities



<P>and disasters.&nbsp; Superstition, without a veil, is a de-



<P>formed thing; for, as it addeth deformity to an



<P>ape, to be so like a man, so the similitude of super-



<P>stition to religion, makes it the more deformed.



<P>And as wholesome meat corrupteth to little worms,



<P>so good forms and orders corrupt, into a number of



<P>petty observances.&nbsp; There is a superstition in avoid-



<P>ing superstition, when men think to do best, if they



<P>go furthest from the superstition, formerly re-



<P>ceived; therefore care would be had that (as it



<P>fareth in ill purgings) the good be not taken away



<P>with the bad; which commonly is done, when the



<P>people is the reformer.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Deformity</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>DEFORMED persons are commonly even with



<P>nature; for as nature hath done ill by them,



<P>so do they by nature; being for the most part (as



<P>the Scripture saith) void of natural affection; and



<P>so they have their revenge of nature.&nbsp; Certainly



<P>there is a consent, between the body and the mind;



<P>and where nature erreth in the one, she ventureth



<P>in the other.&nbsp; Ubi peccat in uno, periclitatur in al-



<P>tero.&nbsp; But because there is, in man, an election



<P>touching the frame of his mind, and a necessity in



<P>the frame of his body, the stars of natural inclina-



<P>tion are sometimes obscured, by the sun of disci-



<P>pline and virtue.&nbsp; Therefore it is good to consider of



<P>deformity, not as a sign, which is more deceivable;



<P>but as a cause, which seldom faileth of the effect.



<P>Whosoever hath anything fixed in his person, that



<P>doth induce contempt, hath also a perpetual spur



<P>in himself, to rescue and deliver himself from



<P>scorn.&nbsp; Therefore all deformed persons, are extreme



<P>bold.&nbsp; First, as in their own defence, as being ex-



<P>posed to scorn; but in process of time, by a general



<P>habit.&nbsp; Also it stirreth in them industry, and espe-



<P>cially of this kind, to watch and observe the weak-



<P>ness of others, that they may have somewhat to



<P>repay.&nbsp; Again, in their superiors, it quencheth



<P>jealousy towards them, as persons that they think



<P>they may, at pleasure, despise: and it layeth their



<P>competitors and emulators asleep; as never believ-



<P>ing they should be in possibility of advancement,



<P>till they see them in possession.&nbsp; So that upon the



<P>matter, in a great wit, deformity is an advantage



<P>to rising.&nbsp; Kings in ancient times (and at this pres-



<P>ent in some countries) were wont to put great trust



<P>in eunuchs; because they that are envious towards



<P>all are more obnoxious and officious, towards one.



<P>But yet their trust towards them, hath rather



<P>been as to good spials, and good wbisperers, than



<P>good magistrates and officers.&nbsp; And much like is



<P>the reason of deformed persons.&nbsp; Still the ground



<P>is, they will, if they be of spirit, seek to free them-



<P>selves from scorn; which must be either by virtue



<P>or malice; and therefore let it not be marvelled, if



<P>sometimes they prove excellent persons; as was



<P>Agesilaus, Zanger the son of Solyman, AEsop,



<P>Gasca, President of Peru; and Socrates may go



<P>likewise amongst them; with others.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>THESE things are but toys, to come amongst



<P>such serious observations.&nbsp; But yet, since



<P>princes will have such things, it is better they



<P>should be graced with elegancy, than daubed with



<P>cost.&nbsp; Dancing to song, is a thing of great state and



<P>pleasure.&nbsp; I understand it, that the song be in quire,



<P>placed aloft, and accompanied with some broken



<P>music; and the ditty fitted to the device.&nbsp; Acting in



<P>song, especially in dialogues, hath an extreme



<P>good grace; I say acting, not dancing (for that is a



<P>mean and vulgar thing); and the voices of the dia-



<P>logue would be strong and manly (a base and a



<P>tenor; no treble); and the ditty high and tragical;



<P>not nice or dainty.&nbsp; Several quires, placed one over



<P>against another, and taking the voice by catches,



<P>anthem-wise, give great pleasure.&nbsp; Turning dances



<P>into figure, is a childish curiosity.&nbsp; And generally



<P>let it be noted, that those things which I here set



<P>down, are such as do naturally take the sense, and



<P>not respect petty wonderments.&nbsp; It is true, the al-



<P>terations of scenes, so it be quietly and without



<P>noise, are things of great beauty and pleasure; for



<P>they feed and relieve the eye, before it be full of



<P>the same object.&nbsp; Let the scenes abound with light,



<P>specially colored and varied; and let the masquers,



<P>or any other, that are to come down from the



<P>scene, have some motions upon the scene itself,



<P>before their coming down; for it draws the eye



<P>strangely, and makes it, with great pleasure, to



<P>desire to see, that it cannot perfectly discern.&nbsp; Let



<P>the songs be loud and cheerful, and not chirpings



<P>or pulings.&nbsp; Let the music likewise be sharp and



<P>loud, and well placed.&nbsp; The colors that show best by



<P>candle-light are white, carnation, and a kind of



<P>sea-water-green; and oes, or spangs, as they are of



<P>no great cost, so they are of most glory.&nbsp; As for rich



<P>embroidery, it is lost and not discerned.&nbsp; Let the



<P>suits of the masquers be graceful, and such as be-



<P>come the person, when the vizors are off; not after



<P>examples of known attires; Turke, soldiers, mari-



<P>ners', and the like.&nbsp; Let anti-masques not be long;



<P>they have been commonly of fools, satyrs, baboons,



<P>wild-men, antics, beasts, sprites, witches, Ethiops,



<P>pigmies, turquets, nymphs, rustics, Cupids, statuas



<P>moving, and the like.&nbsp; As for angels, it is not comi-



<P>cal enough, to put them in anti-masques; and



<P>anything that is hideous, as devils, giants, is on



<P>the other side as unfit.&nbsp; But chiefly, let the music



<P>of them be recreative, and with some strange



<P>changes.&nbsp; Some sweet odors suddenly coming forth,



<P>without any drops falling, are, in such a company



<P>as there is steam and heat, things of great pleasure



<P>and refreshment.&nbsp; Double masques, one of men,



<P>another of ladies, addeth state and variety.&nbsp; But all



<P>is nothing except the room be kept clear and neat.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For justs, and tourneys, and barriers; the glories



<P>of them are chiefly in the chariots, wherein the



<P>challengers make their entry; especially if they



<P>be drawn with strange beasts: as lions, bears,



<P>camels, and the like; or in the devices of their en-



<P>trance; or in the bravery of their liveries; or in the



<P>goodly furniture of their horses and armor.&nbsp; But



<P>enough of these toys.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Suspicion</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>SUSPICIONS amongst thoughts, are like bats



<P>amongst birds, they ever fly by twilight.&nbsp; Cer-



<P>tainly they are to be repressed, or at least well



<P>guarded: for they cloud the mind; they leese



<P>friends; and they check with business, whereby



<P>business cannot go on currently and constantly.



<P>They dispose kings to tyranny, husbands to jeal-



<P>ousy, wise men to irresolution and melancholy.



<P>They are defects, not in the heart, but in the brain;



<P>for they take place in the stoutest natures; as in the



<P>example of Henry the Seventh of England.&nbsp; There



<P>was not a more suspicious man, nor a more stout.



<P>And in such a composition they do small hurt.&nbsp; For



<P>commonly they are not admitted, but with exami-



<P>nation, whether they be likely or no.&nbsp; But in fearful



<P>natures they gain ground too fast.&nbsp; There is nothing



<P>makes a man suspect much, more than to know



<P>little; and therefore men should remedy suspicion,



<P>by procuring to know more, and not to keep their



<P>suspicions in smother.&nbsp; What would men have? Do



<P>they think, those they&nbsp; employ and deal with, are



<P>saints? Do they not think, they will have their own



<P>ends, and be truer to themselves, than to them?



<P>Therefore there is no better way, to moderate sus-



<P>picions, than to account upon such suspicions as



<P>true, and yet to bridle them as false.&nbsp; For so far a



<P>man ought to make use of suspicions, as to provide,



<P>as if that should be true, that he suspects, yet it



<P>may do him no hurt.&nbsp; Suspicions that the mind of



<P>itself gathers, are but buzzes; but suspicions that



<P>are artificially nourished, and put into men's



<P>heads, by the tales and whisperings of others, have



<P>stings.&nbsp; Certainly, the best mean, to clear the way



<P>in this same wood of suspicions, is frankly to com-



<P>municate them with the party, that he suspects;



<P>for thereby he shall be sure to know more of the



<P>truth of them, than he did before; and withal shall



<P>make that party more circumspect, not to give



<P>further cause of suspicion.&nbsp; But this would not be



<P>done to men of base natures; for they, if they find



<P>themselves once suspected, will never be true.&nbsp; The



<P>Italian says, Sospetto licentia fede; as if suspicion,



<P>did give a passport to faith; but it ought, rather, to



<P>kindle it to discharge itself.

   <TITLE>Of Fame</TITLE>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Fame</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>THE poets make Fame a monster.&nbsp; They de-



<P>scribe her in part finely and elegantly, and



<P>in part gravely and sententiously.&nbsp; They say, look



<P>how many feathers she hath, so many eyes she



<P>hath underneath; so many tongues; so many



<P>voices; she pricks up so many ears.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This is a flourish.&nbsp; There follow excellent par-



<P>ables; as that, she gathereth strength in going;



<P>that she goeth upon the ground, and yet hideth her



<P>head in the clouds; that in the daytime she sitteth



<P>in a watch tower, and flieth most by night; that



<P>she mingleth things done, with things not done;



<P>and that she is a terror to great cities.&nbsp; But that



<P>which passeth all the rest is: They do recount that



<P>the Earth, mother of the giants that made war



<P>against Jupiter, and were by him destroyed, there-



<P>upon in an anger brought forth Fame.&nbsp; For certain



<P>it is, that rebels, figured by the giants, and seditious



<P>fames and libels, are but brothers and sisters, mas-



<P>culine and feminine.&nbsp; But now, if a man can tame



<P>this monster, and bring her to feed at the hand,



<P>and govern her, and with her fly other ravening



<P>fowl and kill them, it is somewhat worth.&nbsp; But we



<P>are infected with the style of the poets.&nbsp; To speak



<P>now in a sad and serious manner: There is not, in



<P>all the politics, a place less handled and more



<P>worthy to be handled, than this of fame.&nbsp; We will



<P>therefore speak of these points: What are false



<P>fames; and what are true fames; and how they



<P>may be best discerned; how fames may be sown,



<P>and raised; how they may be spread, and multi-



<P>plied; and how they may be checked, and laid



<P>dead.&nbsp; And other things concerning the nature of



<P>fame.&nbsp; Fame is of that force, as there is scarcely any



<P>great action, wherein it hath not a great part; es-



<P>pecially in the war.&nbsp; Mucianus undid Vitellius, by



<P>a fame that he scattered, that Vitellius had in pur-



<P>pose to remove the legions of Syria into Germany,



<P>and the legions of Germany into Syria; where-



<P>upon the legions of Syria were infinitely inflamed.



<P>Julius Caesar took Pompey unprovided, and laid



<P>asleep his industry and preparations, by a fame



<P>that he cunningly gave out: Caesar's own soldiers



<P>loved him not, and being wearied with the wars,



<P>and laden with the spoils of Gaul, would forsake



<P>him, as soon as he came into Italy.&nbsp; Livia settled



<P>all things for the succession of her son Tiberius, by



<P>continual giving out, that her husband Augustus



<P>was upon recovery and amendment, and it is an



<P>usual thing with the pashas, to conceal the death



<P>of the Great Turk from the janizaries and men of



<P>war, to save the sacking of Constantinople and



<P>other towns, as their manner is.&nbsp; Themistocles made



<P>Xerxes, king of Persia, post apace out of Grecia, by



<P>giving out, that the Grecians had a purpose to



<P>break his bridge of ships, which he had made ath-



<P>wart Hellespont.&nbsp; There be a thousand such like



<P>examples; and the more they are, the less they



<P>need to be repeated; because a man meeteth with



<P>them everywhere.&nbsp; Therefore let all wise governors



<P>have as great a watch and care over fames, as they



<P>have of the actions and designs themselves.

<BODY>





<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Great Place</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>MEN in great place are thrice servants: ser-



<P>vants of the sovereign or state; servants of



<P>fame; and servants of business.&nbsp; So as they have no



<P>freedom; neither in their persons, nor in their ac-



<P>tions, nor in their times.&nbsp; It is a strange desire, to



<P>seek power and to lose liberty: or to seek power



<P>over others, and to lose power over a man's self.



<P>The rising unto place is laborious; and by pains,



<P>men come to greater pains; and it is sometimes



<P>base; and by indignities, men come to dignities.



<P>The standing is slippery, and the regress is either



<P>a downfall, or at least an eclipse, which is a melan-



<P>choly thing.&nbsp; Cum non sis qui fueris, non esse cur



<P>velis vivere.&nbsp; Nay, retire men cannot when they



<P>would, neither will they, when it were reason; but



<P>are impatient of privateness, even in age and sick-



<P>ness, which require the shadow; like old towns-



<P>men, that will be still sitting at their street door,



<P>though thereby they offer age to scom.&nbsp; Certainly



<P>great persons had need to borrow other men's



<P>opinions, to think themselves happy; for if they



<P>judge by their own feeling, they cannot find it; but



<P>if they think with themselves, what other men



<P>think of them, and that other men would fain be,



<P>as they are, then they are happy, as it were, by



<P>report; when perhaps they find the contrary



<P>within.&nbsp; For they are the first, that find their own



<P>griefs, though they be the last, that find their



<P>own faults.&nbsp; Certainly men in great fortunes are



<P>strangers to themselves, and while they are in the



<P>puzzle of business, they have no time to tend their



<P>health, either of body or mind.&nbsp; Illi mors gravis



<P>incubat, qui notus nimis omnibus, ignotus moritur



<P>sibi.&nbsp; In place, there is license to do good, and evil;



<P>whereof the latter is a curse: for in evil, the best



<P>condition is not to win; the second, not to can.&nbsp; But



<P>power to do good, is the true and lawful end of



<P>aspiring.&nbsp; For good thoughts (though God accept



<P>them) yet, towards men, are little better than good



<P>dreams, except they be put in act; and that cannot



<P>be, without power and place, as the vantage, and



<P>commanding ground.&nbsp; Merit and good works, is



<P>the end of man's motion; and conscience of the



<P>same is the accomplishment of man's rest.&nbsp; For if a



<P>man can be partaker of God's theatre, he shall like-



<P>wise be partaker of God's rest.&nbsp; Et conversus Deus,



<P>ut aspiceret opera quae fecerunt manus suae, vidit



<P>quod omnia essent bona nimis; and then the sab-



<P>bath.&nbsp; In the discharge of thy place, set before thee



<P>the best examples; for imitation is a globe of pre-



<P>cepts.&nbsp; And after a time, set before thee thine own



<P>example; and examine thyself strictly, whether



<P>thou didst not best at first.&nbsp; Neglect not also the



<P>examples, of those that have carried themselves



<P>ill, in the same place; not to set off thyself, by tax-



<P>ing their memory, but to direct thyself, what to



<P>avoid.&nbsp; Reform therefore, without bravery, or scan-



<P>dal of former times and persons; but yet set it down



<P>to thyself, as well to create good precedents, as to



<P>follow them.&nbsp; Reduce things to the first institution,



<P>and observe wherein, and how, they have degen-



<P>erate; but yet ask counsel of both times; of the



<P>ancient time, what is best; and of the latter time,



<P>what is fittest.&nbsp; Seek to make thy course regular,



<P>that men may know beforehand, what they may



<P>expect; but be not too positive and peremptory;



<P>and express thyself well, when thou digressest



<P>from thy rule.&nbsp; Preserve the right of thy place; but



<P>stir not questions of jurisdiction; and rather as-



<P>sume thy right, in silence and de facto, than voice



<P>it with claims, and challenges.&nbsp; Preserve likewise



<P>the rights of inferior places; and think it more



<P>honor, to direct in chief, than to be busy in all.



<P>Embrace and invite helps, and advices, touching



<P>the execution of thy place; and do not drive away



<P>such, as bring thee information, as meddlers; but



<P>accept of them in good part.&nbsp; The vices of authority



<P>are chiefly four: delays, corruption, roughness,



<P>and facility.&nbsp; For delays: give easy access; keep



<P>times appointed; go through with that which is in



<P>hand, and interlace not business, but of necessity.



<P>For corruption: do not only bind thine own hands,



<P>or thy servants' hands, from taking, but bind the



<P>hands of suitors also, from offering.&nbsp; For integrity



<P>used doth the one; but integrity professed, and



<P>with a manifest detestation of bribery, doth the



<P>other.&nbsp; And avoid not only the fault, but the sus-



<P>picion.&nbsp; Whosoever is found variable, and changeth



<P>manifestly without manifest cause, giveth sus-



<P>picion of corruption.&nbsp; Therefore always, when thou



<P>changest thine opinion or course, profess it plainly,



<P>and declare it, together with the reasons that move



<P>thee to change; and do not think to steal it.&nbsp; A



<P>servant or a favorite, if he be inward, and no



<P>other apparent cause of esteem, is commonly



<P>thought, but a by-way to close corruption.&nbsp; For



<P>roughness: it is a needless cause of discontent:



<P>severity breedeth fear, but roughness breedeth



<P>hate.&nbsp; Even reproofs from authority, ought to be



<P>grave, and not taunting.&nbsp; As for facility: it is worse



<P>than bribery.&nbsp; For bribes come but now and then;



<P>but if importunity, or idle respects, lead a man, he



<P>shall never be without.&nbsp; As Solomon saith, To re-



<P>spect persons is not good; for such a man will



<P>transgress for a piece of bread.&nbsp; It is most true, that



<P>was anciently spoken, A place showeth the man.



<P>And it showeth some to the better, and some to the



<P>worse.&nbsp; Omnium consensu capax imperii, nisi im-



<P>perasset, saith Tacitus of Galba; but of Vespasian



<P>he saith, Solus imperantium, Vespasianus mutatus



<P>in melius; though the one was meant of sufficiency,



<P>the other of manners, and affection.&nbsp; It is an assured



<P>sign of a worthy and generous spirit, whom honor



<P>amends.&nbsp; For honor is, or should be, the place of



<P>virtue; and as in nature, things move violently to



<P>their place, and calmly in their place, so virtue in



<P>ambition is violent, in authority settled and calm.



<P>All rising to great place is by a winding star; and



<P>if there be factions, it is good to side a man's self,



<P>whilst he is in the rising, and to balance himself



<P>when he is placed.&nbsp; Use the memory of thy prede-



<P>cessor, fairly and tenderly; for if thou dost not, it is



<P>a debt will sure be paid when thou art gone.&nbsp; If



<P>thou have colleagues, respect them, and rather call



<P>them, when they look not for it, than exclude



<P>them , when they have reason to look to be called.



<P>Be not too sensible, or too remembering, of thy



<P>place in conversation, and private answers to



<P>suitors; but let it rather be said, When he sits in



<P>place, he is another man.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>COSTLY followers are not to be liked; lest



<P>while a man maketh his train longer, he



<P>make his wings shorter.&nbsp; I reckon to be costly, not



<P>them alone which charge the purse, but which are



<P>wearisome, and importune in suits.&nbsp; Ordinary fol-



<P>lowers ought to challenge no higher conditions,



<P>than countenance, recommendation, and protec-



<P>tion from wrongs.&nbsp; Factious followers are worse to



<P>be liked, which follow not upon affection to him,



<P>with whom they range themselves, but upon



<P>discontentment conceived against some other;



<P>whereupon commonly ensueth that ill intelli-



<P>gence, that we many times see between great per-



<P>sonages.&nbsp; Likewise glorious followers, who make



<P>themselves as trumpets of the commendation of



<P>those they follow, are full of inconvenience; for



<P>they taint business through want of secrecy; and



<P>they export honor from a man, and make him a



<P>return in envy.&nbsp; There is a kind of followers like-



<P>wise, which are dangerous, being indeed espials;



<P>which inquire the secrets of the house, and bear



<P>tales of them, to others.&nbsp; Yet such men, many times,



<P>are in great favor; for they are officious, and com-



<P>monly exchange tales.&nbsp; The following by certain



<P>estates of men, answerable to that, which a great



<P>person himself professeth (as of soldiers, to him



<P>that hath been employed in the wars, and the like),



<P>hath ever been a thing civil, and well taken, even



<P>in monarchies; so it be without too much pomp



<P>or popularity.&nbsp; But the most honorable kind of fol-



<P>lowing, is to be followed as one, that apprehendeth



<P>to advance virtue, and desert, in all sorts of per-



<P>sons.&nbsp; And yet, where there is no eminent odds in



<P>sufficiency, it is better to take with the more pass-



<P>able, than with the more able.&nbsp; And besides, to



<P>speak truth, in base times, active men are of more



<P>use than virtuous.&nbsp; It is true that in government, it



<P>is good to use men of one rank equally: for to coun-



<P>tenance some extraordinarily, is to make them



<P>insolent, and the rest discontent; because they



<P>may claim a due.&nbsp; But contrariwise, in favor, to



<P>use men with much difference and election is



<P>good; for it maketh the persons preferred more



<P>thankful, and the rest more officious: because all is



<P>of favor.&nbsp; It is good discretion, not to make too much



<P>of any man at the first; because one cannot hold



<P>out that proportion.&nbsp; To be governed (as we call it)



<P>by one is not safe; for it shows softness, and gives



<P>a freedom, to scandal and disreputation; for those,



<P>that would not censure or speak ill of a man imme-



<P>diately, will talk more boldly of those that are so



<P>great with them, and thereby wound their honor.



<P>Yet to be distracted with many is worse; for it



<P>makes men to be of the last impression, and full of



<P>change.&nbsp; To take advice of some few friends, is ever



<P>honorable; for lookers-on many times see more



<P>than gamesters; and the vale best discovereth the



<P>hill.&nbsp; There is little friendship in the world, and least



<P>of all between equals, which was wont to be mag-



<P>nified.&nbsp; That that is, is between superior and in-



<P>ferior, whose fortunes may comprehend the one



<P>the other.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Praise</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>PRAISE is the reflection of virtue; but it is as



<P>the glass or body, which giveth the reflec-



<P>tion.&nbsp; If it be from the common people, it is com-



<P>monly false and naught; and rather followeth vain



<P>persons, than virtuous.&nbsp; For the common people



<P>understand not many excellent virtues.&nbsp; The lowest



<P>virtues draw praise from them; the middle virtues



<P>work in them astonishment or admiration; but of



<P>the highest virtues, they have no sense of perceiv-



<P>ing at all.&nbsp; But shows, and species virtutibus similes,



<P>serve best with them.&nbsp; Certainly fame is like a river,



<P>that beareth up things light and swoln, and drowns



<P>things weighty and solid.&nbsp; But if persons of quality



<P>and judgment concur, then it is (as the Scripture



<P>saith) nomen bonum instar unguenti fragrantis.



<P>It fireth all round about, and will not easily away.



<P>For the odors of ointments are more durable, than



<P>those of flowers.&nbsp; There be so many false points of



<P>praise, that a man may justly hold it a suspect.



<P>Some praises proceed merely of flattery; and if he



<P>be an ordinary flatterer, he will have certain com-



<P>mon attributes, which may serve every man; if he



<P>be a cunning flatterer, he will follow the arch-



<P>flatterer, which is a man's self; and wherein a man



<P>thinketh best of himself, therein the flatterer will



<P>uphold him most: but if he be an impudent flat-



<P>terer, look wherein a man is conscious to himself,



<P>that he is most defective, and is most out of counte-



<P>nance in himself, that will the flatterer entitle him



<P>to perforce, spreta conscientia.&nbsp; Some praises come



<P>of good wishes and respects, which is a form due, in



<P>civility, to kings and great persons, laudando



<P>praecipere, when by telling men what they are,



<P>they represent to them, what they should be.&nbsp; Some



<P>men are praised maliciously, to their hurt, thereby



<P>to stir envy and jealousy towards them: pessimum



<P>genus inimicorum laudantium; insomuch as it



<P>was a proverb, amongst the Grecians, that he that



<P>was praised to his hurt, should have a push rise



<P>upon his nose; as we say, that a blister will rise



<P>upon one's tongue, that tells a lie.&nbsp; Certainly mod-



<P>erate praise, used with opportunity, and not vul-



<P>gar, is that which doth the good.&nbsp; Solomon saith,



<P>He that praiseth his friend aloud, rising early, it



<P>shall be to him no better than a curse.&nbsp; Too much



<P>magnifying of man or matter, doth irritate con-



<P>tradiction, and procure envy and scorn.&nbsp; To praise



<P>a man's self, cannot be decent, except it be in rare



<P>cases; but to praise a man's office or profession, he



<P>may do it with good grace, and with a kind of mag-



<P>nanimity.&nbsp; The cardinals of Rome, which are theo-



<P>logues, and friars, and Schoolmen, have a phrase



<P>of notable contempt and scorn towards civil busi-



<P>ness: for they call all temporal business of wars,



<P>embassages, judicature, and other employments,



<P>sbirrerie, which is under-sheriffries; as if they



<P>were but matters, for under-sheriffs and catch-



<P>poles: though many times those under-sheriffries



<P>do more good, than their high speculations.&nbsp; St.



<P>Paul, when he boasts of himself, he doth oft inter-



<P>lace, I speak like a fool; but speaking of his calling,



<P>he saith, magnificabo apostolatum meum.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Expense</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>RICHES are for spending, and spending for



<P>honor and good actions.&nbsp; Therefore extra-



<P>ordinary expense must be limited by the worth of



<P>the occasion; for voluntary undoing, may be as



<P>well for a man's country, as for the kingdom of



<P>heaven.&nbsp; But ordinary expense, ought to be limited



<P>by a man's estate; and governed with such regard,



<P>as it be within his compass; and not subject to de-



<P>ceit and abuse of servants; and ordered to the best



<P>show, that the bills may be less than the estima-



<P>tion abroad.&nbsp; Certainly, if a man will keep but of



<P>even hand, his ordinary expenses ought to be but



<P>to the half of his receipts; and if he think to wax



<P>rich, but to the third part.&nbsp; It is no baseness, for the



<P>greatest to descend and look into their own estate.



<P>Some forbear it, not upon negligence alone, but



<P>doubting to bring themselves into melancholy, in



<P>respect they shall find it broken.&nbsp; But wounds can-



<P>not be cured without searching.&nbsp; He that cannot



<P>look into his own estate at all, had need both choose



<P>well those whom he employeth, and change them



<P>often; for new are more timorous and less subtle.



<P>He that can look into his estate but seldom, it be-



<P>hooveth him to turn all to certainties.&nbsp; A man had



<P>need, if he be plentiful in some kind of expense, to



<P>be as saving again in some other.&nbsp; As if he be plenti-



<P>ful in diet, to be saving in apparel; if he be plenti-



<P>ful in the hall, to be saving in the stable; and the



<P>like.&nbsp; For he that is plentiful in expenses of all kinds,



<P>will hardly be preserved from decay.&nbsp; In clearing



<P>of a man's estate, he may as well hurt himself in



<P>being too sudden, as in letting it run on too long.



<P>For hasty selling, is commonly as disadvantage-



<P>able as interest.&nbsp; Besides, he that clears at once will



<P>relapse; for finding himself out of straits, he will



<P>revert to his custom: but he that cleareth by de-



<P>grees, induceth a habit of frugality, and gaineth



<P>as well upon his mind, as upon his estate.&nbsp; Cer-



<P>tainly, who hath a state to repair, may not despise



<P>small things; and commonly it is less dishonor-



<P>able, to abridge petty charges, than to stoop to



<P>petty gettings.&nbsp; A man ought warily to begin



<P>charges which once begun will continue; but in



<P>matters that return not, he may be more magnificent.

   <TITLE>Of Cunning</TITLE>

</HEAD>

<BODY>





<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Cunning</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>WE TAKE cunning for a sinister or crooked



<P>wisdom.&nbsp; And certainly there is a great dif-



<P>ference, between a cunning man, and a wise man;



<P>not only in point of honesty, but in point of ability.



<P>There be, that can pack the cards, and yet cannot



<P>play well; so there are some that are good in can-



<P>vasses and factions, that are otherwise weak men.



<P>Again, it is one thing to understand persons, and



<P>another thing to understand matters; for many



<P>are perfect in men's humors, that are not greatly



<P>capable of the real part of business; which is the



<P>constitution of one that hath studied men, more



<P>than books.&nbsp; Such men are fitter for practice, than



<P>for counsel; and they are good, but in their own



<P>alley: turn them to new men, and they have lost



<P>their aim; so as the old rule, to know a fool from a



<P>wise man, Mitte ambos nudos ad ignotos, et vide-



<P>bis, doth scarce hold for them.&nbsp; And because these



<P>cunning men, are like haberdashers of small



<P>wares, it is not amiss to set forth their shop.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It is a point of cunning, to wait upon him with



<P>whom you speak, with your eye; as the Jesuits give



<P>it in precept: for there be many wise men, that



<P>have secret hearts, and transparent countenances.



<P>Yet this would be done with a demure abasing of



<P>your eye, sometimes, as the Jesuits also do use.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Another is, that when you have anything to



<P>obtain, of present despatch, you entertain and



<P>amuse the party, with whom you deal, with some



<P>other discourse; that he be not too much awake to



<P>make objections.&nbsp; I knew a counsellor and secre-



<P>tary, that never came to Queen Elizabeth of Eng-



<P>land, with bills to sign, but he would always first



<P>put her into some discourse of estate, that she



<P>mought the less mind the bills.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The like surprise may be made by moving



<P>things, when the party is in haste, and cannot stay



<P>to consider advisedly of that is moved.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If a man would cross a business, that he doubts



<P>some other would handsomely and effectually



<P>move, let him pretend to wish it well, and move it



<P>himself in such sort as may foil it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The breaking off, in the midst of that one was



<P>about to say, as if he took himself up, breeds a



<P>greater appetite in him with whom you confer, to



<P>know more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And because it works better, when anything



<P>seemeth to be gotten from you by question, than



<P>if you offer it of yourself, you may lay a bait for a



<P>question, by showing another visage, and counte-



<P>nance, than you are wont; to the end to give occa-



<P>sion, for the party to ask, what the matter is of the



<P>change? As Nehemias did; And I had not before



<P>that time, been sad before the king.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In things that are tender and unpleasing, it is



<P>good to break the ice, by some whose words are of



<P>less weight, and to reserve the more weighty voice,



<P>to come in as by chance, so that he may be asked



<P>the question upon the other's speech: as Narcissus



<P>did, relating to Claudius the marriage of Messa-



<P>lina and Silius.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In things that a man would not be seen in him-



<P>self, it is a point of cunning, to borrow the name of



<P>the world; as to say, The world says, or There is a



<P>speech abroad.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I knew one that, when he wrote a letter, he



<P>would put that, which was most material, in the



<P>postscript, as if it had been a by-matter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I knew another that, when he came to have



<P>speech, he would pass over that, that he intended



<P>most; and go forth, and come back again, and



<P>speak of it as of a thing, that he had almost forgot.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Some procure themselves, to be surprised, at



<P>such times as it is like the party that they work



<P>upon, will suddenly come upon them; and to be



<P>found with a letter in their hand, or doing some-



<P>what which they are not accustomed; to the end,



<P>they may be apposed of those things, which of



<P>themselves they are desirous to utter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It is a point of cunning, to let fall those words in



<P>a man's own name, which he would have another



<P>man learn, and use, and thereupon take advan-



<P>tage.&nbsp; I knew two, that were competitors for the



<P>secretary's place in Queen Elizabeth's time, and



<P>yet kept good quarter between themselves; and



<P>would confer, one with another, upon the busi-



<P>ness; and the one of them said, That to be a secre-



<P>tary, in the declination of a monarchy, was a



<P>ticklish thing, and that he did not affect it: the



<P>other straight caught up those words, and dis-



<P>coursed with divers of his friends, that he had no



<P>reason to desire to be secretary, in the declination



<P>of a monarchy.&nbsp; The first man took hold of it, and



<P>found means it was told the Queen; who, hearing



<P>of a declination of a monarchy, took it so ill, as she



<P>would never after hear of the other's suit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There is a cunning, which we in England call,



<P>the turning of the cat in the pan; which is, when



<P>that which a man says to another, he lays it as if



<P>another had said it to him.&nbsp; And to say truth, it is



<P>not easy, when such a matter passed between two,



<P>to make it appear from which of them it first



<P>moved and began.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It is a way that some men have, to glance and



<P>dart at others, by justifying themselves by nega-



<P>tives; as to say, This I do not; as Tigellinus did



<P>towards Burrhus, Se non&nbsp; diversas&nbsp; spes,&nbsp; sed&nbsp; incolu-



<P>mitatem imperatoris simpliciter spectare.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Some have in readiness so many tales and



<P>stories, as there is nothing they would insinuate,



<P>but they can wrap it into a tale; which serveth both



<P>to keep themselves more in guard, and to make



<P>others carry it with more pleasure.&nbsp; It is a good



<P>point of cunning, for a man to shape the answer



<P>he would have, in his own words and propositions;



<P>for it makes the other party stick the less.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It is strange how long some men will lie in wait



<P>to speak somewhat they desire to say; and how far



<P>about they will fetch; and how many other mat-



<P>ters they will beat over, to come near it.&nbsp; It is a thing



<P>of great patience, but yet of much use.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A sudden, bold, and unexpected question doth



<P>many times surprise a man, and lay him open.



<P>Like to him that , having changed his name, and



<P>walking in Paul's, another suddenly came behind



<P>him, and called him by his true name, whereat



<P>straightways he looked back.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But these small wares, and petty points, of cun-



<P>ning, are infinite; and it were a good deed to make



<P>a list of them; for that nothing doth more hurt in



<P>a state, than that cunning men pass for wise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But certainly some there are that know the re-



<P>sorts and falls of business, that cannot sink into



<P>the main of it; like a house that hath convenient



<P>stairs and entries, but never a fair room.&nbsp; Therefore,



<P>you shall see them find out pretty looses in the con-



<P>clusion, but are no ways able to examine or debate



<P>matters.&nbsp; And yet commonly they take advantage



<P>of their inability, and would be thought wits of



<P>direction.&nbsp; Some build rather upon the abusing of



<P>others, and (as we now say) putting tricks upon



<P>them, than upon soundness of their own proceed-



<P>ings.&nbsp; But Solomon saith, Prudens advertit ad gres-



<P>sus suos; stultus divertit ad dolos.

   <TITLE>Of Envy</TITLE>

</HEAD>

<BODY>





<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Envy</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>THERE be none of the affections, which have



<P>been noted to fascinate or bewitch, but love



<P>and envy.&nbsp; They both have vehement wishes; they



<P>frame themselves readily into imaginations and



<P>suggestions; and they come easily into the eye,



<P>especially upon the present of the objects; which



<P>are the points that conduce to fascination, if any



<P>such thing there be.&nbsp; We see likewise, the Scripture



<P>calleth envy an evil eye; and the astrologers, call



<P>the evil influences of the stars, evil aspects; so that



<P>still there seemeth to be acknowledged, in the act



<P>of envy, an ejaculation or irradiation of the eye.



<P>Nay, some have been so curious, as to note, that



<P>the times when the stroke or percussion of an envi-



<P>ous eye doth most hurt, are when the party envied



<P>is beheld in glory or triumph; for that sets an edge



<P>upon envy: and besides, at such times the spirits



<P>of the person envied, do come forth most into the



<P>outward parts, and so meet the blow.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But leaving these curiosities (though not un-



<P>worthy to be thought on, in fit place), we will



<P>handle, what persons are apt to envy others; what



<P>persons are most subject to be envied themselves;



<P>and what is the difference between public and



<P>private envy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A man that hath no virtue in himself, ever en-



<P>vieth virtue in others.&nbsp; For men's minds, will either



<P>feed upon their own good, or upon others' evil; and



<P>who wanteth the one, will prey upon the other;



<P>and whoso is out of hope, to attain to another's



<P>virtue, will seek to come at even hand, by depress-



<P>ing another's fortune.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A man that is busy, and inquisitive, is com-



<P>monly envious.&nbsp; For to know much of other men's



<P>matters, cannot be because all that ado may con-



<P>cern his own estate; therefore it must needs be,



<P>that he taketh a kind of play-pleasure, in looking



<P>upon the fortunes of others.&nbsp; Neither can he, that



<P>mindeth but his own business, find much matter



<P>for envy.&nbsp; For envy is a gadding passion, and walk-



<P>eth the streets, and doth not keep home: Non est



<P>curiosus, quin idem sit malevolus.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Men of noble birth, are noted to be envious



<P>towards new men, when they rise.&nbsp; For the distance



<P>is altered, and it is like a deceit of the eye, that



<P>when others come on, they think themselves, go



<P>back.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Deformed persons, and eunuchs, and old men,



<P>and bastards, are envious.&nbsp; For he that cannot pos-



<P>sibly mend his own case, will do what he can, to



<P>impair another's; except these defects light upon



<P>a very brave, and heroical nature, which thinketh



<P>to make his natural wants part of his honor; in that



<P>it should be said, that an eunuch, or a lame man,



<P>did such great matters; affecting the honor of a



<P>miracle; as it was in Narses the eunuch, and Agesi-



<P>laus and Tamberlanes, that were lame men.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The same is the case of men, that rise after ca-



<P>lamities and misfortunes.&nbsp; For they are as men



<P>fallen out with the times; and think other men's



<P>harms, a redemption of their own sufferings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They that desire to excel in too many matters,



<P>out of levity and vain glory, are ever envious.&nbsp; For



<P>they cannot want work; it being impossible, but



<P>many, in some one of those things, should surpass



<P>them.&nbsp; Which was the character of Adrian the Em-



<P>peror; that mortally envied poets, and painters,



<P>and artificers, in works wherein he had a vein to



<P>excel.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lastly, near kinsfolks, and fellows in office, and



<P>those that have been bred together, are more apt



<P>to envy their equals, when they are raised.&nbsp; For it



<P>doth upbraid unto them their own fortunes, and



<P>pointeth at them, and cometh oftener into their



<P>remembrance, and incurreth likewise more into



<P>the note of others; and envy ever redoubleth from



<P>speech and fame.&nbsp; Cain's envy was the more vile



<P>and malignant, towards his brother Abel, because



<P>when his sacrifice was better accepted, there was



<P>no body to look on.&nbsp; Thus much for those, that are



<P>apt to envy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Concerning those that are more or less subject



<P>to envy: First, persons of eminent virtue, when



<P>they are advanced, are less envied.&nbsp; For their for-



<P>tune seemeth , but due unto them; and no man



<P>envieth the payment of a debt, but rewards and



<P>liberality rather.&nbsp; Again, envy is ever joined with



<P>the comparing of a man's self; and where there is



<P>no comparison, no envy; and therefore kings are



<P>not envied, but by kings.&nbsp; Nevertheless it is to be



<P>noted, that unworthy persons are most envied, at



<P>their first coming in, and afterwards overcome it



<P>better; whereas contrariwise, persons of worth



<P>and merit are most envied, when their fortune



<P>continueth long.&nbsp; For by that time, though their



<P>virtue be the same, yet it hath not the same lustre;



<P>for fresh men grow up that darken it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Persons of noble blood, are less envied in their



<P>rising.&nbsp; For it seemeth but right done to their birth.



<P>Besides, there seemeth not much added to their



<P>fortune; and envy is as the sunbeams, that beat



<P>hotter upon a bank, or steep rising ground, than



<P>upon a flat.&nbsp; And for the same reason, those that are



<P>advanced by degrees, are less envied than those



<P>that are advanced suddenly and per saltum.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Those that have joined with their honor great



<P>travels, cares, or perils, are less subject to envy.



<P>For men think that they earn their honors hardly,



<P>and pity them sometimes; and pity ever healeth



<P>envy.&nbsp; Wherefore you shall observe, that the more



<P>deep and sober sort of politic persons, in their



<P>greataess, are ever bemoaning themselves, what



<P>a life they lead; chanting a quanta patimur! Not



<P>that they feel it so, but only to abate the edge of



<P>envy.&nbsp; But this is to be understood, of business that



<P>is laid upon men, and not such, as they call unto



<P>themselves.&nbsp; For nothing increaseth envy more,



<P>than an unnecessary and ambitious engrossing of



<P>business.&nbsp; And nothing doth extinguish envy more,



<P>than for a great person to preserve all other infe-



<P>rior officers, in their full lights and pre-eminences



<P>of their places.&nbsp; For by that means, there be so



<P>many screens between him and envy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Above all, those are most subject to envy, which



<P>carry the greatness of their fortunes, in an insolent



<P>and proud manner; being never well, but while



<P>they are showing how great they are, either by



<P>outward pomp, or by triumphing over all opposi-



<P>tion or competition; whereas wise men will rather



<P>do sacrifice to envy, in suffering themselves some-



<P>times of purpose to be crossed, and overborne in



<P>things that do not much concern them.&nbsp; Notwith-



<P>standing, so much is true, that the carriage of



<P>greatness, in a plain and open manner (so it be



<P>without arrogancy and vain glory) doth draw less



<P>envy, than if it be in a more crafty and cunning



<P>fashion.&nbsp; For in that course, a man doth but dis-



<P>avow fortune; and seemeth to be conscious of his



<P>own want in worth; and doth but teach others, to



<P>envy him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lastly, to conclude this part; as we said in the



<P>beginning, that the act of envy had somewhat in



<P>it of witchcraft, so there is no other cure of envy,



<P>but the cure of witchcraft; and that is, to remove



<P>the lot (as they call it) and to lay it upon another.



<P>For which purpose, the wiser sort of great persons,



<P>bring in ever upon the stage somebody upon whom



<P>to derive the envy, that would come upon them-



<P>selves; sometimes upon ministers and servants;



<P>sometimes upon colleagues and associates; and the



<P>like; and for that turn there are never wanting,



<P>some persons of violent and undertaking natures,



<P>who, so they may have power and business, will



<P>take it at any cost.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, to speak of public envy.&nbsp; There is yet some



<P>good in public envy, whereas in private, there is



<P>none.&nbsp; For public envy, is as an ostracism, that



<P>eclipseth men, when they grow too great.&nbsp; And



<P>therefore it is a bridle also to great ones, to keep



<P>them within bounds.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This envy, being in the Latin word invidia,



<P>goeth in the modern language, by the name of



<P>discontentment; of which we shall speak, in hand-



<P>ling sedition.&nbsp; It is a disease, in a state, like to infec-



<P>tion.&nbsp; For as infection spreadeth upon that which is



<P>sound, and tainteth it; so when envy is gotten once



<P>into a state, it traduceth even the best actions



<P>thereof, and turneth them into an ill odor.&nbsp; And



<P>therefore there is little won, by intermingling of



<P>plausible actions.&nbsp; For that doth argue but a weak-



<P>ness, and fear of envy, which hurteth so much the



<P>more, as it is likewise usual in infections; which



<P>if you fear them, you call them upon you.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This public envy, seemeth to beat chiefly upon



<P>principal officers or ministers, rather than upon



<P>kings, and estates themselves.&nbsp; But this is a sure



<P>rule, that if the envy upon the minister be great,



<P>when the cause of it in him is small; or if the envy



<P>be general, in a manner upon all the ministers of



<P>an estate; then the envy (though hidden) is truly



<P>upon the state itself.&nbsp; And so much of public envy



<P>or discontentment, and the difference thereof from



<P>private envy, which was handled in the first place.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>We will add this in general, touching the affec-



<P>tion of envy; that of all other affections, it is the



<P>most importune and continual.&nbsp; For of other affec-



<P>tions, there is occasion given, but now and then;



<P>and therefore it was well said, Invidia festos dies



<P>non agit: for it is ever working upon some or other.



<P>And it is also noted, that love and envy do make a



<P>man pine, which other affections do not, because



<P>they are not so continual.&nbsp; It is also the vilest affec-



<P>tion, and the most depraved; for which cause it



<P>is the proper attribute of the devil, who is called,



<P>the envious man, that soweth tares amongst the



<P>wheat by night; as it always cometh to pass, that



<P>envy worketh subtilly, and in the dark, and to the



<P>prejudice of good things, such as is the wheat.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Death</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>MEN fear death, as children fear to go in the



<P>dark; and as that natural fear in children,



<P>is increased with tales, so is the other.&nbsp; Certainly,



<P>the contemplation of death, as the wages of sin,



<P>and passage to another world, is holy and relig-



<P>ious; but the fear of it, as a tribute due unto nature,



<P>is weak.&nbsp; Yet in religious meditations, there is some-



<P>times mixture of vanity, and of superstition.&nbsp; You



<P>shall read, in some of the friars' books of mortifica-



<P>tion, that a man should think with himself, what



<P>the pain is, if he have but his finger's end pressed,



<P>or tortured, and thereby imagine, what the pains



<P>of death are, when the whole body is corrupted,



<P>and dissolved; when many times death passeth,



<P>with less pain than the torture of a limb; for the



<P>most vital parts, are not the quickest of sense.&nbsp; And



<P>by him that spake only as a philosopher, and nat-



<P>ural man, it was well said, Pompa mortis magis



<P>terret, quam mors ipsa.&nbsp; Groans, and convulsions,



<P>and a discolored face, and friends weeping, and



<P>blacks, and obsequies, and the like, show death



<P>terrible.&nbsp; It is worthy the observing, that there is no



<P>passion in the mind of man, so weak, but it mates,



<P>and masters, the fear of death; and therefore,



<P>death is no such terrible enemy, when a man hath



<P>so many attendants about him, that can win the



<P>combat of him.&nbsp; Revenge triumphs over death; love



<P>slights it; honor aspireth to it; grief flieth to it; fear



<P>preoccupateth it; nay, we read, after Otho the em-



<P>peror had slain himself, pity (which is the tender-



<P>est of affections) provoked many to die, out of mere



<P>compassion to their sovereign, and as the truest



<P>sort of followers.&nbsp; Nay, Seneca adds niceness and



<P>satiety: Cogita quamdiu eadem feceris; mori velle,



<P>non tantum fortis aut miser, sed etiam fastidiosus



<P>potest.&nbsp; A man would die, though he were neither



<P>valiant, nor miserable, only upon a weariness to



<P>do the same thing so oft, over and over.&nbsp; It is no less



<P>worthy, to observe, how little alteration in good



<P>spirits, the approaches of death make; for they



<P>appear to be the same men, till the last instant.



<P>Augustus Caesar died in a compliment; Livia, con-



<P>jugii nostri memor, vive et vale.&nbsp; Tiberius in dissi-



<P>mulation; as Tacitus saith of him, Jam Tiberium



<P>vires et corpus, non dissimulatio, deserebant.&nbsp; Ves-



<P>pasian in a jest, sitting upon the stool; Ut puto deus



<P>fio.&nbsp; Galba with a sentence; Feri, si ex re sit populi



<P>Romani; holding forth his neck.&nbsp; Septimius Severus



<P>in despatch; Adeste si quid mihi restat agendum.



<P>And the like.&nbsp; Certainly the Stoics bestowed too



<P>much cost upon death, and by their great prepara-



<P>tions, made it appear more fearful.&nbsp; Better saith he,



<P>qui finem vitae extremum inter munera ponat



<P>naturae.&nbsp; It is as natural to die, as to be born; and to



<P>a little infant, perhaps, the one is as painful, as the



<P>other.&nbsp; He that dies in an earnest pursuit, is like one



<P>that is wounded in hot blood; who, for the time,



<P>scarce feels the hurt; and therefore a mind fixed,



<P>and bent upon somewhat that is good, doth avert



<P>the dolors of death.&nbsp; But, above all, believe it, the



<P>sweetest canticle is', Nunc dimittis; when a man



<P>hath obtained worthy ends, and expectations.



<P>Death hath this also; that it openeth the gate to



<P>good fame, and extinguisheth envy. - Extinctus



<P>amabitur idem.

<BODY>





<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Love</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>THE stage is more beholding to love, than the



<P>life of man.&nbsp; For as to the stage, love is ever



<P>matter of comedies, and now and then of tragedies;



<P>but in life it doth much mischief; sometimes like a



<P>siren, sometimes like a fury.&nbsp; You may observe, that



<P>amongst all the great and worthy persons (whereof



<P>the memory remaineth, either ancient or recent)



<P>there is not one, that hath been transported to



<P>the mad degree of love: which shows that great



<P>spirits, and great business, do keep out this weak



<P>passion.&nbsp; You must except, nevertheless, Marcus



<P>Antonius, the half partner of the empire of Rome,



<P>and Appius Claudius, the decemvir and lawgiver;



<P>whereof the former was indeed a voluptuous man,



<P>and inordinate; but the latter was an austere and



<P>wise man: and therefore it seems (though rarely)



<P>that love can find entrance, not only into an open



<P>heart, but also into a heart well fortified, if watch



<P>be not well kept.&nbsp; It is a poor saying of Epicurus,



<P>Satis&nbsp; magnum&nbsp; alter&nbsp; alteri&nbsp; theatrum&nbsp; sumus;&nbsp;

as&nbsp;&nbsp; if



<P>man,&nbsp; made&nbsp; for&nbsp; the&nbsp; contemplation&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp;

heaven,&nbsp;&nbsp; and



<P>all noble objects, should do nothing but kneel be-



<P>fore a little idol, and make himself a subject,



<P>though not of the mouth (as beasts are), yet of the



<P>eye; which was given him for higher purposes.&nbsp; It



<P>is a strange thing, to note the excess of this passion,



<P>and how it braves the nature, and value of things,



<P>by this; that the speaking in a perpetual hyper-



<P>bole, is comely in nothing but in love.&nbsp; Neither is it



<P>merely in the phrase; for whereas it hath been



<P>well said, that the arch-flatterer, with whom all



<P>the petty flatterers have intelligence, is a man's



<P>self; certainly the lover is more.&nbsp; For there was



<P>never proud man thought so absurdly well of him-



<P>self, as the lover doth of the person loved; and



<P>therefore it was well said, That it is impossible to



<P>love, and to be wise.&nbsp; Neither doth this weakness



<P>appear to others only, and not to the party loved;



<P>but to the loved most of all, except the love be reci-



<P>proque.&nbsp; For it is a true rule, that love is ever re-



<P>warded, either with the reciproque, or with an



<P>inward and secret contempt.&nbsp; By how much the



<P>more, men ought to beware of this passion, which



<P>loseth not only other things, but itself! As for the



<P>other losses, the poet's relation doth well figure



<P>them: that he that preferred Helena, quitted the



<P>gifts of Juno and Pallas.&nbsp; For whosoever esteemeth



<P>too much of amorous affection, quitteth both riches



<P>and wisdom.&nbsp; This passion hath his floods, in very



<P>times of weakness; which are great prosperity, and



<P>great adversity; though this latter hath been less



<P>observed: both which times kindle love, and make



<P>it more fervent, and therefore show it to be the



<P>child of folly.&nbsp; They do best, who if they cannot but



<P>admit love, yet make it keep quarters; and sever it



<P>wholly from their serious affairs, and actions, of



<P>life; for if it check once with business, it troubleth



<P>men's fortunes, and maketh men, that they can no



<P>ways be true to their own ends.&nbsp; I know not how,



<P>but martial men are given to love: I think, it is but



<P>as they are given to wine; for perils commonly ask



<P>to be paid in pleasures.&nbsp; There is in man's nature, a



<P>secret inclination and motion, towards love of



<P>others, which if it be not spent upon some one or a



<P>few, doth naturally spread itself towards many,



<P>and maketh men become humane and charitable;



<P>as it is seen sometime in friars.&nbsp; Nuptial love maketh



<P>mankind; friendly love perfecteth it; but wanton



<P>love corrupteth, and embaseth it.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>I MEAN not to speak of divine prophecies; nor



<P>of heathen oracles; nor of natural predictions;



<P>but only of prophecies that have been of cer-



<P>tain memory, and from hidden causes.&nbsp; Saith the



<P>Pythonissa to Saul, To-morrow thou and thy son



<P>shall be with me.&nbsp; Homer hath these verses:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At domus AEneae cunctis dominabitur oris,



<P>Et nati natorum, et qui nascentur ab illis.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A prophecy, as it seems, of the Roman empire.



<P>Seneca the tragedian hath these verses:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp; --Venient annis



<P>Saecula seris, quibus Oceanus



<P>Vincula rerum laxet, et ingens



<P>Pateat Tellus, Tiphysque novos



<P>Detegat orbes; nec sit terris



<P>Ultima Thule:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>a prophecy of the discovery of America.&nbsp; The daugh-



<P>ter of Polycrates, dreamed that Jupiter bathed her



<P>father, and Apollo anointed him; and it came to



<P>pass, that he was crucified in an open place, where



<P>the sun made his body run with sweat, and the



<P>rain washed it.&nbsp; Philip of Macedon dreamed, he



<P>sealed up bis wife's belly; whereby he did expound



<P>it, that his wife should be barren; but Aristander



<P>the soothsayer, told him his wife was with child,



<P>because men do not use to seal vessels, that are



<P>empty.&nbsp; A phantasm that appeared to M. Brutus, in



<P>his tent, said to him, Philippis iterum me videbis.



<P>Tiberius said to Galba, Tu quoque, Galba, degusta-



<P>bis imperium.&nbsp; In Vespasian's time, there went a



<P>prophecy in the East, that those that should come



<P>forth of Judea, should reign over the world:



<P>which though it may be was meant of our Savior;



<P>yet Tacitus expounds it of Vespasian.&nbsp; Domitian



<P>dreamed, the night before he was slain, that a



<P>golden head was growing, out of the nape of his



<P>neck: and indeed, the succession that followed him



<P>for many years, made golden times.&nbsp; Henry the



<P>Sixth of England, said of Henry the Seventh, when



<P>he was a lad, and gave him water, This is the lad



<P>that shall enjoy the crown, for which we strive.



<P>When I was in France, I heard from one Dr. Pena,



<P>that the Queen Mother, who was given to curious



<P>arts, caused the King her husband's nativity to be



<P>calculated, under a false name; and the astrologer



<P>gave a judgment, that he should be killed in a duel;



<P>at which the Queen laughed, thinking her hus-



<P>band to be above challenges and duels: but he was



<P>slain upon a course at tilt, the splinters of the staff



<P>of Montgomery going in at his beaver.&nbsp; The trivial



<P>prophecy, which I heard when I was a child, and



<P>Queen Elizabeth was in the flower of her years,



<P>was,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When hempe is spun

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>England's done:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>whereby it was generally conceived, that after the



<P>princes had reigned, which had the principal



<P>letters of that word hempe (which were Henry,



<P>Edward, Mary, Philip, and Elizabeth), England



<P>should come to utter confusion; which, thanks be



<P>to God, is verified only in the change of the name;



<P>for that the King's style, is now no more of Eng-



<P>land but of Britain.&nbsp; There was also another proph-



<P>ecy, before the year of '88, which I do not well



<P>understand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There shall be seen upon a day,



<P>Between the Baugh and the May,



<P>The black fleet of Norway.



<P>When that that is come and gone,



<P>England build houses of lime and stone,



<P>For after wars shall you have none.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was generally conceived to be meant, of the



<P>Spanish fleet that came in '88: for that the king of



<P>Spain's surname, as they say, is Norway.&nbsp; The pre-



<P>diction of Regiomontanus,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Octogesimus octavus mirabilis annus,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>was thought likewise accomplished in the sending



<P>of that great fleet, being the greatest in strength,



<P>though not in number, of all that ever swam upon



<P>the sea.&nbsp; As for Cleon's dream, I think it was a jest.



<P>It was, that he was devoured of a long dragon; and



<P>it was expounded of a maker of sausages, that



<P>troubled him exceedingly.&nbsp; There are numbers of



<P>the like kind; especially if you include dreams, and



<P>predictions of astrology.&nbsp; But I have set down these



<P>few only, of certain credit, for example.&nbsp; My judg-



<P>ment is, that they ought all to be despised; and



<P>ought to serve but for winter talk by the fireside.



<P>Though when I say despised, I mean it as for be-



<P>lief; for otherwise, the spreading, or publishing,



<P>of them, is in no sort to be despised.&nbsp; For they have



<P>done much mischief; and I see many severe laws



<P>made, to suppress them.&nbsp; That that hath given them



<P>grace, and some credit, consisteth in three things.



<P>First, that men mark when they hit, and never



<P>mark when they miss; as they do generally also of



<P>dreams.&nbsp; The second is, that probable conjectures,



<P>or obscure traditions, many times turn themselves



<P>into prophecies; while the nature of man, which



<P>coveteth divination, thinks it no peril to foretell



<P>that which indeed they do but collect.&nbsp; As that of



<P>Seneca's verse.&nbsp; For so much was then subject to



<P>demonstration, that the globe of the earth had



<P>great parts beyond the Atlantic, which mought



<P>be probably conceived not to be all sea: and adding



<P>thereto the tradition in Plato's Timaeus, and his



<P>Atlanticus, it mought encourage one to turn it to



<P>a prediction.&nbsp; The third and last (which is the great



<P>one) is, that almost all of them, being infinite in



<P>number, have been impostures, and by idle and



<P>crafty brains merely contrived and feigned, after



<P>the event past.

   <TITLE>Of Anger</TITLE>

</HEAD>

<BODY>





<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Anger</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>TO SEEK to extinguish anger utterly, is but a



<P>bravery of the Stoics.&nbsp; We have better oracles:



<P>Be angry, but sin not.&nbsp; Let not the sun go down



<P>upon your anger.&nbsp; Anger must be limited and con-



<P>fined, both in race and in time.&nbsp; We will first speak



<P>how the natural inclination and habit to be angry,



<P>may be attempted and calmed.&nbsp; Secondly, how the



<P>particular motions of anger may be repressed, or



<P>at least refrained from doing mischief.&nbsp; Thirdly,



<P>how to raise anger, or appease anger in another.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For the first; there is no other way but to medi-



<P>tate, and ruminate well upon the effects of anger,



<P>how it troubles man's life.&nbsp; And the best time to do



<P>this, is to look back upon anger, when the fit is



<P>thoroughly over.&nbsp; Seneca saith well, That anger is



<P>like ruin, which breaks itself upon that it falls.



<P>The Scripture exhorteth us to possess our souls in



<P>patience.&nbsp; Whosoever is out of patience, is out of



<P>possession of his soul.&nbsp; Men must not turn bees;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>...&nbsp; animasque in vulnere ponunt.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anger is certainly a kind of baseness; as it ap-



<P>pears well in the weakness of those subjects in



<P>whom it reigns; children, women, old folks, sick



<P>folks.&nbsp; Only men must beware, that they carry



<P>their anger rather with scorn, than with fear; so



<P>that they may seem rather to be above the injury,



<P>than below it; which is a thing easily done, if a



<P>man will give law to himself in it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For the second point; the causes and motives of



<P>anger, are chiefly three.&nbsp; First, to be too sensible of



<P>hurt; for no man is angry, that feels not himself



<P>hurt; and therefore tender and delicate persons



<P>must needs be oft angry; they have so many things



<P>to trouble them, which more robust natures have



<P>little sense of.&nbsp; The next is, the apprehension and



<P>construction of the injury offered, to be, in the cir-



<P>cumstances thereof, full of contempt: for contempt



<P>is that, which putteth an edge upon anger, as much



<P>or more than the hurt itself.&nbsp; And therefore, when



<P>men are ingenious in picking out circumstances of



<P>contempt, they do kindle their anger much.&nbsp; Lastly,



<P>opinion of the touch of a man's reputation, doth



<P>multiply and sharpen anger.&nbsp; Wherein the remedy



<P>is, that a man should have, as Consalvo was wont



<P>to say, telam honoris crassiorem.&nbsp; But in all refrain-



<P>ings of anger, it is the best remedy to win time;



<P>and to make a man's self believe, that the oppor-



<P>tunity of his revenge is not yet come, but that he



<P>foresees a time for it; and so to still himself in the



<P>meantime, and reserve it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To contain anger from mischief, though it take



<P>hold of a man, there be two things, whereof you



<P>must have special caution.&nbsp; The one, of extreme bit-



<P>terness of words, especially if they be aculeate and



<P>proper; for cummunia maledicta are nothing so



<P>much; and again, that in anger a man reveal no



<P>secrets; for that, makes him not fit for society.&nbsp; The



<P>other, that you do not peremptorily break off, in



<P>any business, in a fit of anger; but howsoever you



<P>show bitterness, do not act anything, that is not



<P>revocable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For raising and appeasing anger in another; it



<P>is done chiefly by choosing of times, when men



<P>are frowardest and worst disposed, to incense



<P>them.&nbsp; Again, by gathering (as was touched before)



<P>all that you can find out, to aggravate the con-



<P>tempt.&nbsp; And the two remedies are by the contraries.



<P>The former to take good times, when first to relate



<P>to a man an angry business; for the first impres-



<P>sion is much; and the other is, to sever, as much as



<P>may be, the construction of the injury from the



<P>point of contempt; imputing it to misunderstand-



<P>ing, fear, passion, or what you will.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>IT IS a trivial grammar-school text, but yet



<P>worthy a wise man's consideration.&nbsp; Question



<P>was asked of Demosthenes, what was the chief



<P>part of an orator? he answered, action; what next?



<P>action; what next again? action.&nbsp; He said it, that



<P>knew it best, and had, by nature, himself no ad-



<P>vantage in that he commended.&nbsp; A strange thing,



<P>that that part of an orator, which is but superficial,



<P>and rather the virtue of a player, should be placed



<P>so high, above those other noble parts, of invention,



<P>elocution, and the rest; nay, almost alone, as if it



<P>were all in all.&nbsp; But the reason is plain.&nbsp; There is in



<P>human nature generally, more of the fool than of



<P>the wise; and therefore those faculties, by which



<P>the foolish part of men's minds is taken, are most



<P>potent.&nbsp; Wonderful like is the case of boldness in



<P>civil business: what first? boldness; what second



<P>and third? boldness.&nbsp; And yet boldness is a child of



<P>ignorance and baseness, far inferior to other parts.



<P>But nevertheless it doth fascinate, and bind hand



<P>and foot, those that are either shallow in judg-



<P>ment, or weak in courage, which are the greatest



<P>part; yea and prevaileth with wise men at weak



<P>times.&nbsp; Therefore we see it hath done wonders, in



<P>popular states; but with senates, and princes less;



<P>and more ever upon the first entrance of bold per-



<P>sons into action, than soon after; for boldness is an



<P>ill keeper of promise.&nbsp; Surely, as there are mounte-



<P>banks for the natural body, so are there mounte-



<P>banks for the politic body; men that undertake



<P>great cures, and perhaps have been lucky, in two



<P>or three experiments, but want the grounds of



<P>science, and therefore cannot hold out.&nbsp; Nay, you



<P>shall see a bold fellow many times do Mahomet's



<P>miracle.&nbsp; Mahomet made the people believe that



<P>he would call an hill to him, and from the top of it



<P>offer up his prayers, for the observers of his law.



<P>The people assembled; Mahomet called the hill to



<P>come to him, again and again; and when the hill



<P>stood still, he was never a whit abashed, but said,



<P>If the hill will not come to Mahomet, Mahomet



<P>will go to the hill.&nbsp; So these men, when they have



<P>promised great matters, and failed most shame-



<P>fully, yet (if they have the perfection of boldness)



<P>they will but slight it over, and make a turn, and



<P>no more ado.&nbsp; Certainly to men of great judgment,



<P>bold persons are a sport to behold; nay, and to the



<P>vulgar also, boldness has somewhat of the ridicu-



<P>lous.&nbsp; For if absurdity be the subject of laughter,



<P>doubt you not but great boldness is seldom without



<P>some absurdity.&nbsp; Especially it is a sport to see, when



<P>a bold fellow is out of countenance; for that puts



<P>his face into a most shrunken, and wooden pos-



<P>ture; as needs it must; for in bashfulness, the spirits



<P>do a little go and come; but with bold men, upon



<P>like occasion, they stand at a stay; like a stale at



<P>chess, where it is no mate, but yet the game cannot



<P>stir.&nbsp; But this last were fitter for a satire than for a



<P>serious observation.&nbsp; This is well to be weighed;



<P>that boldness is ever blind; for it seeth not danger,



<P>and inconveniences.&nbsp; Therefore it is ill in counsel,



<P>good in execution; so that the right use of bold per-



<P>sons is, that they never command in chief, but be



<P>seconds, and under the direction of others.&nbsp; For in



<P>counsel, it is good to see dangers; and in execution,



<P>not to see them, except they be very great.

<P>THERE is a wisdom in this; beyond the rules of



<P>physic: a man's own observation, what he



<P>finds good of, and what he finds hurt of, is the best



<P>physic to preserve health.&nbsp; But it is a safer conclu-



<P>sion to say, This agreeth not well with me, there-



<P>fore, I will not continue it; than this, I find no



<P>offence of this, therefore I may use it.&nbsp; For strength



<P>of nature in youth, passeth over many excesses,



<P>which are owing a man till his age.&nbsp; Discern of the



<P>coming on of years, and think not to do the same



<P>things still; for age will not be defied.&nbsp; Beware of



<P>sudden change, in any great point of diet, and, if



<P>necessity enforce it, fit the rest to it.&nbsp; For it is a secret



<P>both in nature and state, that it is safer to change



<P>many things, than one.&nbsp; Examine thy customs of



<P>diet, sleep, exercise, apparel, and the like; and try,



<P>in any thing thou shalt judge hurtful, to discon-



<P>tinue it, by little and little; but so, as if thou dost



<P>find any inconvenience by the change, thou come



<P>back to it again: for it is hard to distinguish that



<P>which is generally held good and wholesome,



<P>from that which is good particularly, and fit for



<P>thine own body.&nbsp; To be free-minded and cheerfully



<P>disposed, at hours of meat, and of sleep, and of



<P>exercise, is one of the best precepts of long lasting.



<P>As for the passions, and studies of the mind; avoid



<P>envy, anxious fears; anger fretting inwards;



<P>subtle and knotty inquisitions; joys and exhilara-



<P>tions in excess; sadness not communicated.&nbsp; Enter-



<P>tain hopes; mirth rather than joy; variety of



<P>delights, rather than surfeit of them; wonder and



<P>admiration, and therefore novelties; studies that



<P>fill the mind with splendid and illustrious objects,



<P>as histories, fables, and contemplations of nature.



<P>If you fly physic in health altogether, it will be too



<P>strange for your body, when you shall need it.&nbsp; If



<P>you make it too familiar, it will work no extra-



<P>ordinary effect, when sickness cometh.&nbsp; I commend



<P>rather some diet for certain seasons, than frequent



<P>use of physic, except it be grown into a custom.&nbsp; For



<P>those diets alter the body more, and trouble it less.



<P>Despise no new accident in your body, but ask



<P>opinion of it.&nbsp; In sickness, respect health prin-



<P>cipally; and in health, action.&nbsp; For those that put



<P>their bodies to endure in health, may in most sick-



<P>nesses, which are not very sharp, be cured only



<P>with diet, and tendering.&nbsp; Celsus could never have



<P>spoken it as a physician, had he not been a wise



<P>man withal, when he giveth it for one of the great



<P>precepts of health and lasting, that a man do vary,



<P>and interchange contraries, but with an inclina-



<P>tion to the more benign extreme: use fasting and



<P>full eating, but rather full eating; watching and



<P>sleep, but rather sleep; sitting and exercise, but



<P>rather exercise; and the like.&nbsp; So shall nature be



<P>cherished, and yet taught masteries.&nbsp; Physicians



<P>are, some of them, so pleasing and conformable to



<P>the humor of the patient, as they press not the true



<P>cure of the disease; and some other are so regular,



<P>in proceeding according to art for the disease, as



<P>they respect not sufficiently the condition of the



<P>patient.&nbsp; Take one of a middle temper; or if it may



<P>not be found in one man, combine two of either



<P>sort; and forget not to call as well, the best ac-



<P>quainted with your body, as the best reputed of



<P>for his faculty.

<P>IT HAD been hard for him that spake it to have



<P>put more truth and untruth together in few



<P>words, than in that speech, Whatsoever is delighted



<P>in solitude, is either a wild beast or a god.&nbsp; For it is



<P>most true, that a natural and secret hatred, and



<P>aversation towards society, in any man, hath



<P>somewhat of the savage beast; but it is most un-



<P>true, that it should have any character at all, of the



<P>divine nature; except it proceed, not out of a pleas-



<P>ure in solitude, but out of a love and desire to



<P>sequester a man's self, for a higher conversation:



<P>such as is found to have been falsely and feignedly



<P>in some of the heathen; as Epimenides the Can-



<P>dian, Numa the Roman, Empedocles the Sicilian,



<P>and Apollonius of Tyana; and truly and really, in



<P>divers of the ancient hermits and holy fathers of



<P>the church.&nbsp; But little do men perceive what soli-



<P>tude is, and how far it extendeth.&nbsp; For a crowd is



<P>not company; and faces are but a gallery of pic-



<P>tures; and talk but a tinkling cymbal, where



<P>there is no love.&nbsp; The Latin adage meeteth with it a



<P>little: Magna civitas, magna solitudo; because in



<P>a great town friends are scattered; so that there is



<P>not that fellowship, for the most part, which is in



<P>less neighborhoods.&nbsp; But we may go further, and



<P>affirm most truly, that it is a mere and miserable



<P>solitude to want true friends; without which the



<P>world is but a wilderness; and even in this sense



<P>also of solitude, whosoever in the frame of his



<P>nature and affections, is unfit for friendship, he



<P>taketh it of the beast, and not from humanity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A principal fruit of friendship, is the ease and



<P>discharge of the fulness and swellings of the heart,



<P>which passions of all kinds do cause and induce.



<P>We know diseases of stoppings, and suffocations,



<P>are the most dangerous in the body; and it is not



<P>much otherwise in the mind; you may take sarza



<P>to open the liver, steel to open the spleen, flowers



<P>of sulphur for the lungs, castoreum for the brain;



<P>but no receipt openeth the heart, but a true friend;



<P>to whom you may impart griefs, joys, fears, hopes,



<P>suspicions, counsels, and whatsoever lieth upon



<P>the heart to oppress it, in a kind of civil shrift or



<P>confession.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It is a strange thing to observe, how high a rate



<P>great kings and monarchs do set upon this fruit of



<P>friendship, whereof we speak: so great, as they



<P>purchase it, many times, at the hazard of their



<P>own safety and greatness.&nbsp; For princes, in regard



<P>of the distance of their fortune from that of their



<P>subjects and servants, cannot gather this fruit, ex-



<P>cept (to make themselves capable thereof) they



<P>raise some persons to be, as it were, companions



<P>and almost equals to themselves, which many



<P>times sorteth to inconvenience.&nbsp; The modern lan-



<P>guages give unto such persons the name of favor-



<P>ites, or privadoes; as if it were matter of grace, or



<P>conversation.&nbsp; But the Roman name attaineth the



<P>true use and cause thereof, naming them parti-



<P>cipes curarum; for it is that which tieth the knot.



<P>And we see plainly that this hath been done, not



<P>by weak and passionate princes only, but by the



<P>wisest and most politic that ever reigned; who



<P>have oftentimes joined to themselves some of



<P>their servants; whom both themselves have called



<P>friends, and allowed other likewise to call them in



<P>the same manner; using the word which is re-



<P>ceived between private men.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>L. Sylla, when he commanded Rome, raised



<P>Pompey (after surnamed the Great) to that height,



<P>that Pompey vaunted himself for Sylla's over-



<P>match.&nbsp; For when he had carried the consulship for



<P>a friend of his, against the pursuit of Sylla, and



<P>that Sylla did a little resent thereat, and began to



<P>speak great, Pompey turned upon him again, and



<P>in effect bade him be quiet; for that more men



<P>adored the sun rising, than the sun setting.&nbsp; With



<P>Julius Caesar, Decimus Brutus had obtained that



<P>interest as he set him down in his testament, for



<P>heir in remainder, after his nephew.&nbsp; And this was



<P>the man that had power with him, to draw him



<P>forth to his death.&nbsp; For when Caesar would have



<P>discharged the senate, in regard of some ill pres-



<P>ages, and specially a dream of Calpurnia; this



<P>man lifted him gently by the arm out of his chair,



<P>telling him he hoped he would not dismiss the



<P>senate, till his wife had dreamt a better dream.



<P>And it seemeth his favor was so great, as Antonius,



<P>in a letter which is recited verbatim in one of



<P>Cicero's Philippics, calleth him venefica, witch;



<P>as if he had enchanted Caesar.&nbsp; Augustus raised



<P>Agrippa (though of mean birth) to that height, as



<P>when he consulted with Maecenas, about the mar-



<P>riage of his daughter Julia, Maecenas took the



<P>liberty to tell him, that he must either marry his



<P>daughter to Agrippa, or take away his life; there



<P>was no third way, he had made him so great.&nbsp; With



<P>Tiberius Caesar, Sejanus had ascended to that



<P>height, as they two were termed, and reckoned, as



<P>a pair of friends.&nbsp; Tiberius in a letter to him saith,



<P>Haec pro amicitia nostra non occultavi; and the



<P>whole senate dedicated an altar to Friendship, as



<P>to a goddess, in respect of the great dearness of



<P>friendship, between them two.&nbsp; The like, or more,



<P>was between Septimius Severus and Plautianus.



<P>For he forced his eldest son to marry the daughter



<P>of Plautianus; and would often maintain Plau-



<P>tianus, in doing affronts to his son; and did write



<P>also in a letter to the senate, by these words: I love



<P>the man so well, as I wish he may over-live me.



<P>Now if these princes had been as a Trajan, or a



<P>Marcus Aurelius, a man might have thought that



<P>this had proceeded of an abundant goodness of



<P>nature; but being men so wise, of such strength



<P>and severity of mind, and so extreme lovers of



<P>themselves, as all these were, it proveth most



<P>plainly that they found their own felicity (though



<P>as great as ever happened to mortal men) but as



<P>an half piece, except they mought have a friend,



<P>to make it entire; and yet, which is more, they



<P>were princes that had wives, sons, nephews; and



<P>yet all these could not supply the comfort of friend-



<P>ship.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It is not to be forgotten, what Comineus observ-



<P>eth of his first master, Duke Charles the Hardy,



<P>namely, that he would communicate his secrets



<P>with none; and least of all, those secrets which



<P>troubled him most.&nbsp; Whereupon he goeth on, and



<P>saith that towards his latter time, that closeness



<P>did impair, and a little perish his understanding.



<P>Surely Comineus mought have made the same



<P>judgment also, if it had pleased him, of his second



<P>master, Lewis the Eleventh, whose closeness was



<P>indeed his tormentor.&nbsp; The parable of Pythagoras



<P>is dark, but true; Cor ne edito; Eat not the heart.



<P>Certainly, if a man would give it a hard phrase,



<P>those that want friends, to open themselves unto,



<P>are carnnibals of their own hearts.&nbsp; But one thing



<P>is most admirable (wherewith I will conclude this



<P>first fruit of friendship), which is, that this com-



<P>municating of a man's self to his friend, works



<P>two contrary effects; for it redoubleth joys, and



<P>cutteth griefs in halves.&nbsp; For there is no man, that



<P>imparteth his joys to his friend, but he joyeth the



<P>more; and no man that imparteth his griefs to his



<P>friend, but he grieveth the less.&nbsp; So that it is in truth,



<P>of operation upon a man's mind, of like virtue as



<P>the alchemists use to attribute to their stone, for



<P>man's body; that it worketh all contrary effects,



<P>but still to the good and benefit of nature.&nbsp; But yet



<P>without praying in aid of alchemists, there is a



<P>manifest image of this, in the ordinary course of



<P>nature.&nbsp; For in bodies, union strengtheneth and



<P>cherisheth any natural action; and on the other



<P>side, weakeneth and dulleth any violent impres-



<P>sion: and even so it is of minds.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The second fruit of friendship, is healthful and



<P>sovereign for the understanding, as the first is for



<P>the affections.&nbsp; For friendship maketh indeed a fair



<P>day in the affections, from storm and tempests; but



<P>it maketh daylight in the understanding, out of



<P>darkness, and confusion of thoughts.&nbsp; Neither is



<P>this to be understood only of faithful counsel,



<P>which a man receiveth from his friend; but before



<P>you come to that, certain it is, that whosoever hath



<P>his mind fraught with many thoughts, his wits



<P>and understanding do clarify and break up, in the



<P>communicating and discoursing with another; he



<P>tosseth his thoughts more easily; he marshalleth



<P>them more orderly, he seeth how they look when



<P>they are turned into words: finally, he waxeth



<P>wiser than himself; and that more by an hour's



<P>discourse, than by a day's meditation.&nbsp; It was well



<P>said by Themistocles, to the king of Persia, That



<P>speech was like cloth of Arras, opened and put



<P>abroad; whereby the imagery doth appear in



<P>figure; whereas in thoughts they lie but as in



<P>packs.&nbsp; Neither is this second fruit of friendship, in



<P>opening the understanding, restrained only to



<P>such friends as are able to give a man counsel;



<P>(they indeed are best;) but even without that, a



<P>man learneth of himself, and bringeth his own



<P>thoughts&nbsp; to light, and whetteth his wits as against



<P>a stone, which itself cuts not.&nbsp; In a word, a man



<P>were better relate himself to a statua, or picture,



<P>than to suffer his thoughts to pass in smother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Add now, to make this second fruit of friendship



<P>complete, that other point, which lieth more open,



<P>and falleth within vulgar observation; which is



<P>faithful counsel from a friend.&nbsp; Heraclitus saith



<P>well in one of his enigmas, Dry light is ever the



<P>best.&nbsp; And certain it is, that the light that a man



<P>receiveth by counsel from another, is drier and



<P>purer, than that which cometh from his own



<P>understanding and judgment; which is ever in-



<P>fused, and drenched, in his affections and customs.



<P>So as there is as much difference between the coun-



<P>sel, that a friend giveth, and that a man giveth



<P>himself, as there is between the counsel of a friend,



<P>and of a flatterer.&nbsp; For there is no such flatterer as



<P>is a man's self; and there is no such remedy against



<P>flattery of a man's self, as the liberty of a friend.



<P>Counsel is of two sorts: the one concerning man-



<P>ners, the other concerning business.&nbsp; For the first,



<P>the best preservative to keep the mind in health, is



<P>the faithful admonition of a friend.&nbsp; The calling of



<P>a man's self to a strict account, is a medicine, some-



<P>time too piercing and corrosive.&nbsp; Reading good



<P>books of morality, is a little flat and dead.&nbsp; Observ-



<P>ing our faults in others, is sometimes improper for



<P>our case.&nbsp; But the best receipt (best, I say, to work,



<P>and best to take) is the admonition of a friend.



<P>It is a strange thing to behold, what gross errors



<P>and extreme absurdities many (especially of the



<P>greater sort) do commit, for want of a friend to tell



<P>them of them; to the great damage both of their



<P>fame and fortune: for, as St. James saith, they are



<P>as men that look sometimes into a glass, and pres-



<P>ently forget their own shape and favor.&nbsp; As for



<P>business, a man may think, if he win, that two



<P>eyes see no more than one; or that a gamester seeth



<P>always more than a looker-on; or that a man in



<P>anger, is as wise as he that hath said over the four



<P>and twenty letters; or that a musket may be shot



<P>off as well upon the arm, as upon a rest; and such



<P>other fond and high imaginations, to think him-



<P>self all in all.&nbsp; But when all is done, the help of good



<P>counsel, is that which setteth business straight.



<P>And if any man think that he will take counsel,



<P>but it shall be by pieces; asking counsel in one



<P>business, of one man, and in another business, of



<P>another man; it is well (that is to say, better, per-



<P>haps, than if he asked none at all); but he runneth



<P>two dangers: one, that he shall not be faithfully



<P>counselled; for it is a rare thing, except it be from



<P>a perfect and entire friend, to have counsel given,



<P>but such as shall be bowed and crooked to some



<P>ends, which he hath, that giveth it.&nbsp; The other, that



<P>he shall have counsel given, hurtful and unsafe



<P>(though with good meaning), and mixed partly of



<P>mischief and partly of remedy; even as if you



<P>would call a physician, that is thought good for



<P>the cure of the disease you complain of, but is unac-



<P>quainted with your body; and therefore may put



<P>you in way for a present cure, but overthroweth



<P>your health in some other kind; and so cure the



<P>disease, and kill the patient.&nbsp; But a friend that is



<P>wholly acquainted with a man's estate, will be-



<P>ware, by furthering any present business, how he



<P>dasheth upon other inconvenience.&nbsp; And therefore



<P>rest not upon scattered counsels; they will rather



<P>distract and mislead, than settle and direct.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After these two noble fruits of friendship (peace



<P>in the affections, and support of the judgment),



<P>followeth the last fruit; which is like the pome-



<P>granate, full of many kernels; I mean aid, and



<P>bearing a part, in all actions and occasions.&nbsp; Here



<P>the best way to represent to life the manifold use



<P>of friendship, is to cast and see how many things



<P>there are, which a man cannot do himself; and



<P>then it will appear, that it was a sparing speech of



<P>the ancients, to say, that a friend is another him-



<P>self; for that a friend is far more than himself.



<P>Men have their time, and die many times, in de-



<P>sire of some things which they principally take to



<P>heart; the bestowing of a child, the finishing of a



<P>work, or the like.&nbsp; If a man have a true friend, he



<P>may rest almost secure that the care of those things



<P>will continue after him.&nbsp; So that a man hath, as it



<P>were, two lives in his desires.&nbsp; A man hath a body,



<P>and that body is confined to a place; but where



<P>friendship is, all offices of life are as it were granted



<P>to him, and his deputy.&nbsp; For he may exercise them



<P>by his friend.&nbsp; How many things are there which



<P>a man cannot, with any face or comeliness, say or



<P>do himself?&nbsp; A man can scarce allege his own



<P>merits with modesty, much less extol them; a man



<P>cannot sometimes brook to supplicate or beg; and



<P>a number of the like.&nbsp; But all these things are grace-



<P>ful, in a friend's mouth, which are blushing in a



<P>man's own.&nbsp; So again, a man's person hath many



<P>proper relations, which he cannot put off.&nbsp; A man



<P>cannot speak to his son but as a father; to his wife



<P>but as a husband; to his enemy but upon terms:



<P>whereas a friend may speak as the case requires,



<P>and not as it sorteth with the person.&nbsp; But to enu-



<P>merate these things were endless; I have given the



<P>rule, where a man cannot fitly play his own part;



<P>if he have not a friend, he may quit the stage.

<P>HE THAT hath wife and children hath given



<P>hostages to fortune; for they are impedi-



<P>ments to great enterprises, either of virtue or mis-



<P>chief.&nbsp; Certainly&nbsp; the&nbsp; best&nbsp; works,&nbsp; and&nbsp;

of&nbsp; greatest



<P>merit for the&nbsp; public,&nbsp; have&nbsp; proceeded&nbsp; from&nbsp;

the&nbsp; un-



<P>married or childless men; which both in affection



<P>and means, have married and endowed the public.



<P>Yet it were great reason that those that have chil-



<P>dren, should have greatest care of future times;



<P>unto which they know they must transmit their



<P>dearest pledges.&nbsp; Some there are, who though they



<P>lead a single life, yet their thoughts do end with



<P>themselves, and account future times imperti-



<P>nences.&nbsp; Nay, there are some other, that account



<P>wife and children, but as bills of charges.&nbsp; Nay



<P>more, there are some foolish rich covetous men,



<P>that take a pride, in having no children, because



<P>they may be thought so much the richer.&nbsp; For per-



<P>haps they have heard some talk, Such an one is a



<P>great rich man, and another except to it, Yea, but



<P>he hath a great charge of children; as if it were an



<P>abatement to his riches.&nbsp; But the most ordinary



<P>cause of a single life, is liberty, especially in certain



<P>self-pleasing and humorous minds, which are so



<P>sensible of every restraint, as they will go near to



<P>think their girdles and garters, to be bonds and



<P>shackles.&nbsp; Unmarried men are best friends, best



<P>masters, best servants; but not always best sub-



<P>jects; for they are light to run away; and almost



<P>all fugitives, are of that condition.&nbsp; A single life



<P>doth well with churchmen; for charity will hardly



<P>water the ground, where it must first fill a pool.&nbsp; It



<P>is indifferent for judges and magistrates; for if



<P>they be facile and corrupt, you shall have a ser-



<P>vant, five times worse than a wife.&nbsp; For soldiers, I



<P>find the generals commonly in their hortatives,



<P>put men in mind of their wives and children; and



<P>I think the despising of marriage amongst the



<P>Turks, maketh the vulgar soldier more base.&nbsp; Cer-



<P>tainly wife and children are a kind of discipline



<P>of humanity; and single men, though they may



<P>be many times more charitable, because their



<P>means are less exhaust, yet, on the other side, they



<P>are more cruel and hardhearted (good to make



<P>severe inquisitors), because their tenderness is not



<P>so oft called upon.&nbsp; Grave natures, led by custom,



<P>and therefore constant, are commonly loving hus-



<P>bands, as was said of Ulysses, vetulam suam praetu-



<P>lit immortalitati.&nbsp; Chaste women are often proud



<P>and froward, as presuming upon the merit of their



<P>chastity.&nbsp; It is one of the best bonds, both of chastity



<P>and obedience, in the wife, if she think her hus-



<P>band wise; which she will never do, if she find him



<P>jealous.&nbsp; Wives are young men's mistresses; com-



<P>panions for middle age; and old men's nurses.&nbsp; So



<P>as a man may have a quarrel to marry, when he



<P>will.&nbsp; But yet he was reputed one of the wise men,



<P>that made answer to the question, when a man



<P>should marry, - A young man not yet, an elder



<P>man not at all.&nbsp; It is often seen that bad husbands,



<P>have very good wives; whether it be, that it raiseth



<P>the price of their husband's kindness, when it



<P>comes; or that the wives take a pride in their



<P>patience.&nbsp; But this never fails, if the bad husbands



<P>were of their own choosing, against their friends'



<P>consent; for then they will be sure to make good



<P>their own folly.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>THE joys of parents are secret; and so are their



<P>griefs and fears.&nbsp; They cannot utter the one;



<P>nor they will not utter the other.&nbsp; Children sweeten



<P>labors; but they make misfortunes more bitter.



<P>They increase the cares of life; but they mitigate



<P>the remembrance of death.&nbsp; The perpetuity by



<P>generation is common to beasts; but memory,



<P>merit, and noble works, are proper to men.&nbsp; And



<P>surely a man shall see the noblest works and foun-



<P>dations have proceeded from childless men; which



<P>have sought to express the images of their minds,



<P>where those of their bodies have failed.&nbsp; So the care



<P>of posterity is most in them, that have no posterity.



<P>They that are the first raisers of their houses, are



<P>most indulgent towards their children; beholding



<P>them as the continuance, not only of their kind, but



<P>of their work; and so both children and creatures.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The difference in affection, of parents towards



<P>their several children, is many times unequal; and



<P>sometimes unworthy; especially in the mothers;



<P>as Solomon saith, A wise son rejoiceth the father,



<P>but an ungracious son shames the mother.&nbsp; A man



<P>shall see, where there is a house full of children,



<P>one or two of the eldest respected, and the young-



<P>est made wantons; but in the midst, some that



<P>are as it were forgotten, who many times, never-



<P>theless, prove the best.&nbsp; The illiberality of parents,



<P>in allowance towards their children, is an harmful



<P>error; makes them base; acquaints them with



<P>shifts; makes them sort with mean company; and



<P>makes them surfeit more when they come to



<P>plenty.&nbsp; And therefore the proof is best, when men



<P>keep their authority towards the children, but not



<P>their purse.&nbsp; Men have a foolish manner (both par-



<P>ents and schoolmasters and servants) in creating



<P>and breeding an emulation between brothers, dur-



<P>ing childhood, which many times sorteth to dis-



<P>cord when they are men, and disturbeth families.



<P>The Italians make little difference between chil-



<P>dren, and nephews or near kinsfolks; but so they



<P>be of the lump, they care not though they pass not



<P>through their own body.&nbsp; And, to say truth, in



<P>nature it is much a like matter; insomuch that we



<P>see a nephew sometimes resembleth an uncle, or



<P>a kinsman, more than his own parent; as the blood



<P>happens.&nbsp; Let parents choose betimes, the vocations



<P>and courses they mean their children should take;



<P>for then they are most flexible; and let them not



<P>too much apply themselves to the disposition of



<P>their children, as thinking they will take best to



<P>that, which they have most mind to.&nbsp; It is true, that



<P>if the affection or aptness of the children be extra-



<P>ordinary, then it is good not to cross it; but gener-



<P>ally the precept is good, optimum elige, suave et



<P>facile illud faciet consuetudo.&nbsp; Younger brothers



<P>are commonly fortunate, but seldom or never



<P>where the elder are disinherited.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Wisdom FOR A MAN'S SELF</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>AN ANT is a wise creature for itself, but it is a



<P>&nbsp;shrewd thing, in an orchard or garden.&nbsp; And



<P>certainly, men that are great lovers of themselves,



<P>waste the public.&nbsp; Divide with reason; between self-



<P>love and society; and be so true to thyself, as thou



<P>be not false to others; specially to thy king and



<P>country.&nbsp; It is a poor centre of a man's actions, him-



<P>self.&nbsp; It is right earth.&nbsp; For that only stands fast upon



<P>his own centre; whereas all things, that have af-



<P>finity with the heavens, move upon the centre of



<P>another, which they benefit.&nbsp; The referring of all



<P>to a man's self, is more tolerable in a sovereign



<P>prince; because themselves are not only them-



<P>selves, but their good and evil is at the peril of the



<P>public fortune.&nbsp; But it is a desperate evil, in a ser-



<P>vant to a prince, or a citizen in a republic.&nbsp; For



<P>whatsoever affairs pass such a man's hands, he



<P>crooketh them to his own ends; which must needs



<P>be often eccentric to the ends of his master, or state.



<P>Therefore, let princes, or states, choose such ser-



<P>vants, as have not this mark; except they mean



<P>their service should be made but the accessory.



<P>That which maketh the effect more pernicious, is



<P>that all proportion is lost.&nbsp; It were disproportion



<P>enough, for the servant's good to be preferred be-



<P>fore the master's; but yet it is a greater extreme,



<P>when a little good of the servant, shall carry things



<P>against a great good of the master's.&nbsp; And yet that



<P>is the case of bad officers, treasurers, ambassadors,



<P>generals, and other false and corrupt servants;



<P>which set a bias upon their bowl, of their own



<P>petty ends and envies, to the overthrow of their



<P>master's great and important affairs.&nbsp; And for the



<P>most part, the good such servants receive, is after



<P>the model of their own fortune; but the hurt they



<P>sell for that good, is after the model of their



<P>master's fortune.&nbsp; And certainly it is the nature of



<P>extreme self-lovers, as they will set an house on fire,



<P>and it were but to roast their eggs; and yet these



<P>men many times hold credit with their masters,



<P>because their study is but to please them, and profit



<P>themselves; and for either respect, they will aban-



<P>don the good of their affairs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Wisdom for a man's self is, in many branches



<P>thereof, a depraved thing.&nbsp; It is the wisdom of rats,



<P>that will be sure to leave a house, somewhat before



<P>it fall.&nbsp; It is the wisdom of the fox, that thrusts out



<P>the badger, who digged and made room for him.



<P>It is the wisdom of crocodiles, that shed tears when



<P>they would devour.&nbsp; But that which is specially to



<P>be noted is, that those which (as Cicero says of



<P>Pompey) are sui amantes, sine rivali, are many



<P>times unfortunate.&nbsp; And whereas they have, all



<P>their times, sacrificed to themselves, they become



<P>in the end, themselves sacrifices to the inconstancy



<P>of fortune, whose wings they thought, by their



<P>self-wisdom, to have pinioned.

<P>STUDIES serve for delight, for ornament, and



<P>for ability.&nbsp; Their chief use for delight, is in



<P>privateness and retiring; for ornament, is in dis-



<P>course; and for ability, is in the judgment, and



<P>disposition of business.&nbsp; For expert men can exe-



<P>cute, and perhaps judge of particulars, one by one;



<P>but the general counsels, and the plots and mar-



<P>shalling of affairs, come best, from those that are



<P>learned.&nbsp; To spend too much time in studies is sloth;



<P>to use them too much for ornament, is affectation;



<P>to make judgment wholly by their rules, is the



<P>humor of a scholar.&nbsp; They perfect nature, and are



<P>perfected by experience: for natural abilities are



<P>like natural plants, that need proyning, by study;



<P>and studies themselves, do give forth directions too



<P>much at large, except they be bounded in by ex-



<P>perience.&nbsp; Crafty men contemn studies, simple men



<P>admire them, and wise men use them; for they



<P>teach not their own use; but that is a wisdom with-



<P>out them, and above them, won by observation.



<P>Read not to contradict and confute; nor to believe



<P>and take for granted; nor to find talk and dis-



<P>course; but to weigh and consider.&nbsp; Some books are



<P>to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few



<P>to be chewed and digested; that is, some books are



<P>to be read only in parts; others to be read, but not



<P>curiously; and some few to be read wholly, and



<P>with diligence and attention.&nbsp; Some books also may



<P>be read by deputy, and extracts made of them by



<P>others; but that would be only in the less impor-



<P>tant arguments, and the meaner sort of books, else



<P>distilled books are like common distilled waters,



<P>flashy things.&nbsp; Reading maketh a full man; confer-



<P>ence a ready man; and writing an exact man.&nbsp; And



<P>therefore, if a man write little, he had need have



<P>a great memory; if he confer little, he had need



<P>have a present wit: and if he read little, he had



<P>need have much cunning, to seem to know, that



<P>he doth not.&nbsp; Histories make men wise; poets witty;



<P>the mathematics subtile; natural philosophy deep;



<P>moral grave; logic and rhetoric able to contend.



<P>Abeunt studia in mores.&nbsp; Nay, there is no stond or



<P>impediment in the wit, but may be wrought out



<P>by fit studies; like as diseases of the body, may



<P>have appropriate exercises.&nbsp; Bowling is good for



<P>the stone and reins; shooting for the lungs and



<P>breast; gentle walking for the stomach; riding for



<P>the head; and the like.&nbsp; So if a man's wit be wan-



<P>dering, let him study the mathematics; for in



<P>demonstrations, if his wit be called away never so



<P>little, he must begin again.&nbsp; If his wit be not apt to



<P>distinguish or find differences, let him study the



<P>Schoolmen; for they are cymini sectores.&nbsp; If he be



<P>not apt to beat over matters, and to call up one



<P>thing to prove and illustrate another, let him study 197



<P>the lawyers' cases.&nbsp; So every defect of the mind,



<P>may have a special receipt.

&nbsp;



<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Simulation AND DISSIMULATION</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>DISSIMULATION is but a faint kind of pol-



<P>icy, or wisdom; for it asketh a strong wit,



<P>and a strong heart, to know when to tell truth, and



<P>to do it.&nbsp; Therefore it is the weaker sort of politics,



<P>that are the great dissemblers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Tacitus saith, Livia sorted well with the arts of



<P>her husband, and dissimulation of her son; attri-



<P>buting arts or policy to Augustus, and dissimula-



<P>tion to Tiberius.&nbsp; And again, when Mucianus



<P>encourageth Vespasian, to take arms against Vitel-



<P>lius, he saith, We rise not against the piercing



<P>judgment of Augustus, nor the extreme caution or



<P>closeness of Tiberius.&nbsp; These properties, of arts or



<P>policy, and dissimulation or closeness, are indeed



<P>habits and faculties several, and to be distin-



<P>guished.&nbsp; For if a man have that penetration of



<P>judgment, as he can discern what things are to



<P>be laid open, and what to be secreted, and what to



<P>be showed at half lights, and to whom and when



<P>(which indeed are arts of state, and arts of life, as



<P>Tacitus well calleth them), to him, a habit of dis-



<P>simulation is a hinderance and a poorness.&nbsp; But if



<P>a man cannot obtain to that judgment, then it is



<P>left to bim generally, to be close, and a dissembler.



<P>For where a man cannot choose, or vary in parti-



<P>culars, there it is good to take the safest, and wari-



<P>est way, in general; like the going softly, by one



<P>that cannot well see.&nbsp; Certainly the ablest men



<P>that ever were, have had all an openness, and



<P>frankness, of dealing; and a name of certainty and



<P>veracity; but then they were like horses well



<P>managed; for they could tell passing well, when to



<P>stop or turn; and at such times, when they thought



<P>the case indeed required dissimulation, if then



<P>they used it, it came to pass that the former opin-



<P>ion, spread abroad, of their good faith and clear-



<P>ness of dealing, made them almost invisible.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There be three degrees of this hiding and veil-



<P>ing of a man's self.&nbsp; The first, closeness, reservation,



<P>and secrecy; when a man leaveth himself without



<P>observation, or without hold to be taken, what he



<P>is. The second, dissimulation, in the negative;



<P>when a man lets fall signs and arguments, that he



<P>is not, that he is.&nbsp; And the third, simulation, in the



<P>affirmative; when a man industriously and ex-



<P>pressly feigns and pretends to be, that he is not.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For the first of these, secrecy; it is indeed the



<P>virtue of a confessor.&nbsp; And assuredly, the secret



<P>man heareth many confessions.&nbsp; For who will open



<P>himself, to a blab or a babbler? But if a man be



<P>thought secret, it inviteth discovery; as the more



<P>close air sucketh in the more open; and as in con-



<P>fession, the revealing is not for worldly use, but for



<P>the ease of a man's heart, so secret men come to



<P>the knowledge of many things in that kind; while



<P>men rather discharge their minds, than impart



<P>their minds.&nbsp; In few words, mysteries are due to



<P>secrecy.&nbsp; Besides (to say truth) nakedness is un-



<P>comely, as well in mind as body; and it addeth no



<P>small reverence, to men's manners and actions, if



<P>they be not altogether open.&nbsp; As for talkers and



<P>futile persons, they are commonly vain and credu-



<P>lous withal.&nbsp; For he that talketh what he knoweth,



<P>will also talk what he knoweth not.&nbsp; Therefore set it



<P>down, that an habit of secrecy, is both politic and



<P>moral.&nbsp; And in this part, it is good that a man's face



<P>give his tongue leave to speak.&nbsp; For the discovery of



<P>a man' s self, by the tracts of his countenance, is a



<P>great weakness and betraying; by how much it is



<P>many times more marked, and believed, than a



<P>man's words.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For the second, which is dissimulation; it fol-



<P>loweth many times upon secrecy, by a necessity;



<P>so that he that will be secret, must be a dissembler



<P>in some degree.&nbsp; For men are too cunning, to suffer



<P>a man to keep an indifferent carriage between



<P>both, and to be secret, without swaying the bal-



<P>ance on either side.&nbsp; They will so beset a man with



<P>questions, and draw him on, and pick it out of him,



<P>that, without an absurd silence, he must show an



<P>inclination one way; or if he do not, they will



<P>gather as much by his silence, as by his speech.&nbsp; As



<P>for equivocations, or oraculous speeches, they can-



<P>not hold out long.&nbsp; So that no man can be secret,



<P>except he give himself a little scope of dissimula-



<P>tion; which is, as it were, but the skirts or train of



<P>secrecy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But for the third degree, which is simulation,



<P>and false profession; that I hold more culpable,



<P>and less politic; except it be in great and rare mat-



<P>ters.&nbsp; And therefore a general custom of simulation



<P>(which is this last degree) is a vice, using either of



<P>a natural falseness or fearfulness, or of a mind that



<P>hath some main faults, which because a man must



<P>needs disguise, it maketh him practise simulation



<P>in other things, lest his hand should be out of use.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The great advantages of simulation and dissi-



<P>mulation are three.&nbsp; First, to lay asleep opposition,



<P>and to surprise.&nbsp; For where a man's intentions are



<P>published, it is an alarum, to call up all that are



<P>against them.&nbsp; The second is, to reserve to a man's



<P>self a fair retreat.&nbsp; For if a man engage himself by



<P>a manifest declaration, he must go through or take



<P>a fall.&nbsp; The third is, the better to discover the mind



<P>of another.&nbsp; For to him that opens himself, men



<P>will hardly show themselves adverse; but will fair



<P>let him go on, and turn their freedom of speech, to



<P>freedom of thought.&nbsp; And therefore it is a good



<P>shrewd proverb of the Spaniard, Tell a lie and find



<P>a troth.&nbsp; As if there were no way of discovery, but



<P>by simulation.&nbsp; There be also three disadvantages,



<P>to set it even.&nbsp; The first, that simulation and dissi-



<P>mulation commonly carry with them a show of



<P>fearfulness, which in any business, doth spoil the



<P>feathers, of round flying up to the mark.&nbsp; The sec-



<P>ond, that it puzzleth and perplexeth the conceits



<P>of many, that perhaps would otherwise co-operate



<P>with him; and makes a man walk almost alone, to



<P>his own ends.&nbsp; The third and greatest is, that it



<P>depriveth a man of one of the most principal in-



<P>struments for action; which is trust and belief.



<P>The best composition and temperature, is to have



<P>openness in fame and opinion; secrecy in habit;



<P>dissimulation in seasonable use; and a power to



<P>feign, if there be no remedy.

<P>FORTUNE is like the market; where many



<P>times if you can stay a little, the price will fall.



<P>Again, it is sometimes like Sibylla's offer; which at



<P>first, offereth the commodity at full, then con-



<P>sumeth part and part, and still holdeth up the



<P>price.&nbsp; For occasion (as it is in the common verse)



<P>turneth a bald noddle, after she hath presented her



<P>locks in front, and no hold taken; or at least turneth



<P>the handle of the bottle, first to be received, and



<P>after the belly, which is hard to clasp.&nbsp; There is



<P>surely no greater wisdom, than well to time the



<P>beginnings, and onsets, of things.&nbsp; Dangers are no



<P>more light, if they once seem light; and more dan-



<P>gers have deceived men, than forced them.&nbsp; Nay,



<P>it were better, to meet some dangers half way,



<P>though they come nothing near, than to keep too



<P>long a watch upon their approaches; for if a man



<P>watch too long, it is odds he will fall asleep.&nbsp; On the



<P>other side, to be deceived with too long shadows



<P>(as some have been, when the moon was low, and



<P>shone on their enemies' back), and so to shoot off



<P>before the time; or to teach dangers to come on, by



<P>over early buckling towards them; is another ex-



<P>treme.&nbsp; The ripeness, or unripeness, of the occasion



<P>(as we said) must ever be well weighed; and gener-



<P>ally it is good, to commit the beginnings of all



<P>great actions to Argus, with his hundred eyes, and



<P>the ends to Briareus, with his hundred hands; first



<P>to watch, and then to speed.&nbsp; For the helmet of



<P>Pluto, which maketh the politic man go invisible,



<P>is secrecy in the counsel, and celerity in the execu-



<P>tion.&nbsp; For when things are once come to the execu-



<P>tion, there is no secrecy, comparable to celerity;



<P>like the motion of a bullet in the air, which flieth



<P>so swift, as it outruns the eye.

<P>HE THAT is only real, had need have exceed-



<P>ing great parts of virtue; as the stone had



<P>need to be rich, that is set without foil.&nbsp; But if a



<P>man mark it well,&nbsp; it is, in praise and commenda-



<P>tion of men, as it is in gettings and gains: for the



<P>proverb is true, That light gains make heavy



<P>purses; for light gains come thick, whereas great,



<P>come but now and then.&nbsp; So it is true, that small



<P>matters win great commendation, because they



<P>are continually in use and in note: whereas the



<P>occasion of any great virtue, cometh but on festi-



<P>vals.&nbsp; Therefore it doth much add to a man's reputa-



<P>tion, and is (as Queen Isabella said) like perpetual



<P>letters commendatory, to have good forms.&nbsp; To at-



<P>tain them, it almost sufficeth not to despise them;



<P>for so shall a man observe them in others; and let



<P>him trust himself with the rest.&nbsp; For if he labor too



<P>much to express them, he shall lose their grace;



<P>which is to be natural and unaffected.&nbsp; Some men's



<P>behavior is like a verse, wherein every syllable is



<P>measured; how can a man comprehend great mat-



<P>ters, that breaketh his mind too much, to small



<P>observations? Not to use ceremonies at all, is to



<P>teach others not to use them again; and so dimin-



<P>isheth respect to himself; especially they be not to



<P>be omitted, to strangers and formal natures; but



<P>the dwelling upon them, and exalting them above



<P>the moon, is not only tedious, but doth diminish



<P>the faith and credit of him that speaks.&nbsp; And cer-



<P>tainly, there is a kind of conveying, of effectual



<P>and imprinting passages amongst compliments,



<P>which is of singular use, if a man can hit upon it.



<P>Amongst a man's peers, a man shall be sure of



<P>familiarity; and therefore it is good, a little to keep



<P>state.&nbsp; Amongst a man's inferiors one shall be sure



<P>of reverence; and therefore it is good, a little to be



<P>familiar.&nbsp; He that is too much in anything, so that



<P>he giveth another occasion of satiety, maketh him-



<P>self cheap.&nbsp; To apply one's self to others, is good; so



<P>it be with demonstration, that a man doth it upon



<P>regard, and not upon facility.&nbsp; It is a good precept



<P>generally, in seconding another, yet to add some-



<P>what of one's own: as if you will grant his opinion,



<P>let it be with some distinction; if you will follow



<P>his motion, let it be with condition; if you allow



<P>his counsel, let it be with alleging further reason.



<P>Men had need beware, how they be too perfect in



<P>compliments; for be they never so sufficient other-



<P>wise, their enviers will be sure to give them that



<P>attribute, to the disadvantage of their greater vir-



<P>tues.&nbsp; It is loss also in business, to be too full of re-



<P>spects, or to be curious, in observing times and



<P>opportunities.&nbsp; Solomon saith, He that considereth



<P>the wind, shall not sow, and he that looketh to



<P>the clouds, shall not reap.&nbsp; A wise man will make



<P>more opportunities, than he finds.&nbsp; Men's behavior



<P>should be, like their apparel, not too strait or point



<P>device, but free for exercise or motion.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>SOME, in their discourse,&nbsp; desire rather com-



<P>mendation of wit, in being able to hold all



<P>arguments, than of judgment, in discerning what



<P>is true; as if it were a praise, to know what might



<P>be said, and not, what should be thought.&nbsp; Some



<P>have certain common places, and themes, wherein



<P>they are good and want variety; which kind of



<P>poverty is for the most part tedious, and when it is



<P>once perceived, ridiculous.&nbsp; The honorablest part of



<P>talk,&nbsp; is to give the occasion; and again to moderate,



<P>and pass to somewhat else; for then a man leads the



<P>dance.&nbsp; It is good, in discourse and speech of con-



<P>versation,&nbsp; to vary and intermingle speech of the



<P>present occasion, with arguments, tales with rea-



<P>sons, asking of questions, with telling of opinions,



<P>and jest with earnest: for it is a dull thing to tire,



<P>and, as we say now, to jade, any thing too far.&nbsp; As



<P>for jest, there be certain things, which ought to be



<P>privileged from it; namely, religion, matters of



<P>state, great persons, any man's present business of



<P>importance, and any case that deserveth pity.&nbsp; Yet



<P>there be some, that think their wits have been



<P>asleep, except they dart out somewhat that is



<P>piquant, and to the quick.&nbsp; That is a vein which



<P>would be bridled:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Parce, puer, stimulis, et fortius utere loris.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And generally, men ought to find the difference,



<P>between saltness and bitterness.&nbsp; Certainly, he that



<P>hath a satirical vein, as he maketh others afraid of



<P>his wit, so he had need be afraid of others' memory.



<P>He that questioneth much, shall learn much, and



<P>content much; but especially, if he apply his ques-



<P>tions to the skill of the persons whom he asketh; for



<P>he shall give them occasion, to please themselves



<P>in speaking, and himself shall continually gather



<P>knowledge.&nbsp; But let his questions not be trouble-



<P>some; for that is fit for a poser.&nbsp; And let him be sure



<P>to leave other men, their turns to speak.&nbsp; Nay, if



<P>there be any, that would reign and take up all



<P>the time, let him find means to take them off,



<P>and to bring others on; as musicians use to do, with



<P>those that dance too long galliards.&nbsp; If you dis-



<P>semble, sometimes, your knowledge of that you



<P>are thought to know, you shall be thought, another



<P>time, to know that you know not.&nbsp; Speech of a



<P>man's self ought to be seldom, and well chosen.&nbsp; I



<P>knew one, was wont to say in scorn, He must needs



<P>be a wise man, he speaks so much of himself: and



<P>there is but one case, wherein a man may com-



<P>mend himself with good grace; and that is in



<P>commending virtue in another; especially if it be



<P>such a virtue, whereunto himself pretendeth.



<P>Speech of touch towards others, should be spar-



<P>ingly used; for discourse ought to be as a field,



<P>without coming home to any man.&nbsp; I knew two



<P>noblemen, of the west part of England, whereof



<P>the one was given to scoff, but kept ever royal cheer



<P>in his house; the other would ask, of those that had



<P>been at the other's table, Tell truly, was there never



<P>a flout or dry blow given? To which the guest



<P>would answer, Such and such a thing passed.



<P>The lord would say, I thought, he would mar a



<P>good dinner.&nbsp; Discretion of speech, is more than



<P>eloquence; and to speak agreeably to him, with



<P>whom we deal, is more than to speak in good



<P>words, or in good order.&nbsp; A good continued speech,



<P>without a good speech of interlocution, shows



<P>slowness: and a good reply or second speech, with-



<P>out a good settled speech, showeth shallowness



<P>and weakness.&nbsp; As we see in beasts, that those that



<P>are weakest in the course, are yet nimblest in the



<P>turn; as it is betwixt the greyhound and the hare.



<P>To use too many circumstances, ere one come to



<P>the matter, is wearisome; to use none at all, is



<P>blunt.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Negotiating</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>IT IS generally better to deal by speech than by



<P>letter; and by the mediation of a third than by



<P>a man's self.&nbsp; Letters are good, when a man would



<P>draw an answer by letter back again; or when it



<P>may serve for a man's justification afterwards to



<P>produce his own letter; or where it may be danger



<P>to be interrupted, or heard by pieces.&nbsp; To deal in



<P>person is good, when a man's face breedeth regard,



<P>as commonly with inferiors; or in tender cases,



<P>where a man's eye, upon the countenance of him



<P>with whom he speaketh, may give him a direction



<P>how far to go; and generally, where a man will



<P>reserve to himself liberty, either to disavow or to



<P>expound.&nbsp; In choice of instruments, it is better to



<P>choose men of a plainer sort, that are like to do



<P>that, that is committed to them, and to report back



<P>again faithfully the success, than those that are



<P>cunning, to contrive, out of other men's business,



<P>somewhat to grace themselves, and will help the



<P>matter in report for satisfaction's sake.&nbsp; Use also



<P>such persons as affect the business, wherein they



<P>are employed; for that quickeneth much; and



<P>such, as are fit for the matter; as bold men for ex-



<P>postulation, fair-spoken men for persuasion, crafty



<P>men for inquiry and observation, froward, and



<P>absurd men, for business that doth not well bear



<P>out itself.&nbsp; Use also such as have been lucky, and



<P>prevailed before, in things wherein you have em-



<P>ployed them; for that breeds confidence, and they



<P>will strive to maintain their prescription.&nbsp; It is bet-



<P>ter to sound a person, with whom one deals afar



<P>off, than to fall upon the point at first; except you



<P>mean to surprise him by some short question.&nbsp; It is



<P>better dealing with men in appetite, than with



<P>those that are where they would be.&nbsp; If a man deal



<P>with another upon conditions, the start or first per-



<P>formance is all; which a man cannot reasonably



<P>demand, except either the nature of the thing be



<P>such, which must go before; or else a man can



<P>persuade the other party, that he shall still need



<P>him in some other thing; or else that he be counted



<P>the honester man.&nbsp; All practice is to discover, or to



<P>work.&nbsp; Men discover themselves in trust, in passion,



<P>at unawares, and of necessity, when they would



<P>have somewhat done, and cannot find an apt pre-



<P>text.&nbsp; If you would work any man, you must either



<P>know his nature and fashions, and so lead him; or



<P>his ends, and so persuade him; or his weakness and



<P>disadvantages, and so awe him; or those that have



<P>interest in him, and so govern him.&nbsp; In dealing with



<P>cunning persons,we must ever consider their ends,



<P>to interpret their speeches; and it is good to say



<P>little to them, and that which they least look for.



<P>In all negotiations of difficulty, a man may not



<P>look to sow and reap at once; but must prepare



<P>business, and so ripen it by degrees.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Fortune</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>IT CANNOT be denied, but outward accidents



<P>conduce much to fortune; favor, opportunity,



<P>death of others, occasion fitting virtue.&nbsp; But chiefly,



<P>the mould of a man's fortune is in his own hands.



<P>Faber quisque fortunae suae, saith the poet.&nbsp; And



<P>the most frequent of external causes is, that the



<P>folly of one man, is the fortune of another.&nbsp; For no



<P>man prospers so suddenly, as by others' errors.



<P>Serpens nisi serpentem comederit non fit draco.



<P>Overt and apparent virtues, bring forth praise; but



<P>there be secret and hidden virtues, that bring forth



<P>fortune; certain deliveries of a man's self, which



<P>have no name.&nbsp; The Spanish name, desemboltura,



<P>partly expresseth them; when there be not stonds



<P>nor restiveness in a man's nature; but that the



<P>wheels of his mind, keep way with the wheels of



<P>his fortune.&nbsp; For so Livy (after he had described



<P>Cato Major in these words, In illo viro tantum ro-



<P>bur corporis et animi fuit, ut quocunque loco natus



<P>esset, fortunam sibi facturus videretur) falleth



<P>upon that, that he had versatile ingenium.&nbsp; There-



<P>fore if a man look sharply and attentively, he shall



<P>see Fortune: for though she be blind, yet she is not



<P>invisible.&nbsp; The way of fortune, is like the Milken



<P>Way in the sky; which is a meeting or knot of a



<P>number of small stars; not seen asunder, but giv-



<P>ing light together.&nbsp; So are there a number of



<P>little, and scarce discerned virtues, or rather facul-



<P>ties and customs, that make men fortunate.&nbsp; The



<P>Italians note some of them, such as a man would



<P>little think.&nbsp; When they speak of one that cannot do



<P>amiss, they will throw in, into his other conditions,



<P>that he hath Poco di matto.&nbsp; And certainly there be



<P>not two more fortunate properties, than to have a



<P>little of the fool, and not too much of the honest.



<P>Therefore extreme lovers of their country or



<P>masters, were never fortunate, neither can they



<P>be. For when a man placeth his thoughts without



<P>himself, he goeth not his own way.&nbsp; An hasty for-



<P>tune maketh an enterpriser and remover (the



<P>French hath it better, entreprenant, or remuant);



<P>but the exercised fortune maketh the able man.



<P>Fortune is to be honored and respected, and it be



<P>but for her daughters, Confidence and Reputation.



<P>For those two, Felicity breedeth; the first within



<P>a man's self, the latter in others towards him.&nbsp; All



<P>wise men, to decline the envy of their own virtues,



<P>use to ascribe them to Providence and Fortune; for



<P>so they may the better assume them: and, besides,



<P>it is greatness in a man, to be the care of the higher



<P>powers.&nbsp; So Caesar said to the pilot in the tempest,



<P>Caesarem portas, et fortunam ejus.&nbsp; So Sylla chose



<P>the name of Felix, and not of Magnus.&nbsp; And it hath



<P>been noted, that those who ascribe openly too



<P>much to their own wisdom and policy, end infor-



<P>tunate.&nbsp; It is written that Timotheus the Athenian,



<P>after he had, in the account he gave to the state of



<P>his government, often interlaced this speech, and



<P>in this, Fortune had no part, never prospered in



<P>anything, he undertook afterwards.&nbsp; Certainly



<P>there be, whose fortunes are like Homer's verses,



<P>that have a slide and easiness more than the verses



<P>of other poets; as Plutarch saith of Timoleon's for-



<P>tune, in respect of that of Agesilaus or Epaminon-



<P>das.&nbsp; And that this shoulld be, no doubt it is much,



<P>in a man's self.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Atheism</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>I HAD rather believe all the fables in the Leg-



<P>end, and the Talmud, and the Alcoran, than



<P>that this universal frame is without a mind.



<P>And therefore, God never wrought miracle, to



<P>convince atheism, because his ordinary works con-



<P>vince it.&nbsp; It is true, that a little philosophy inclineth



<P>man's mind to atheism; but depth in philosophy



<P>bringeth men's minds about to religion.&nbsp; For while



<P>the mind of man looketh upon second causes scat-



<P>tered, it may sometimes rest in them, and go no



<P>further; but when it beholdeth the chain of them,



<P>confederate and linked together, it must needs fly



<P>to Providence and Deity.&nbsp; Nay, even that school



<P>which is most accused of atheism doth most dem-



<P>onstrate religion; that is, the school of Leucippus



<P>and Democritus and Epicurus.&nbsp; For it is a thousand



<P>times more credible, that four mutable elements,



<P>and one immutable fifth essence, duly and eter-



<P>nally placed, need no God, than that an army of



<P>infinite small portions, or seeds unplaced, should



<P>have produced this order and beauty, without a



<P>divine marshal.&nbsp; The Scripture saith, The fool hath



<P>said in his heart, there is no God; it is not said, The



<P>fool hath thought in his heart; so as he rather saith



<P>it, by rote to himself, as that he would have, than



<P>that he can thoroughly believe it, or be persuaded



<P>of it.&nbsp; For none deny, there is a God, but those, for



<P>whom it maketh that there were no God.&nbsp; It ap-



<P>peareth in nothing more, that atheism is rather in



<P>the lip, than in the heart of man, than by this; that



<P>atheists will ever be talking of that their opinion,



<P>as if they fainted in it, within themselves, and



<P>would be glad to be strengthened, by the consent



<P>of others.&nbsp; Nay more, you shall have atheists strive



<P>to get disciples, as it fareth with other sects.&nbsp; And,



<P>which is most of all, you shall have of them, that



<P>will suffer for atheism, and not recant; whereas if



<P>they did truly think, that there were no such thing



<P>as God, why should they trouble themselves? Epi-



<P>curus is charged, that he did but dissemble for his



<P>credit's sake, when he affirmed there were blessed



<P>natures, but such as enjoyed themselves, without



<P>having respect to the government of the world.



<P>Wherein they say he did temporize; though in



<P>secret, he thought there was no God.&nbsp; But certainly



<P>he is traduced; for his words are noble and divine:



<P>Non deos vulgi negare profanum; sed vulgi opini-



<P>ones diis applicare profanum.&nbsp; Plato could have



<P>said no more.&nbsp; And although he had the confidence,



<P>to deny the administration, he had not the power,



<P>to deny the nature.&nbsp; The Indians of the West, have



<P>names for their particular gods, though they have



<P>no name for God: as if the heathens should have



<P>had the names Jupiter, Apollo, Mars, etc., but not



<P>the word Deus; which shows that even those bar-



<P>barous people have the notion, though they have



<P>not the latitude and extent of it.&nbsp; So that against



<P>atheists, the very savages take part, with the very



<P>subtlest philosophers.&nbsp; The contemplative atheist is



<P>rare: a Diagoras, a Bion, a Lucian perhaps, and



<P>some others; and yet they seem to be more than



<P>they are; for that all that impugn a received re-



<P>ligion, or superstition, are by the adverse part



<P>branded with the name of atheists.&nbsp; But the great



<P>atheists, indeed are hypocrites; which are ever



<P>handling holy things, but without feeling; so as



<P>they must needs be cauterized in the end.&nbsp; The



<P>causes of atheism are: divisions in religion, if they



<P>be many; for any one main division, addeth zeal to



<P>both sides; but many divisions introduce atheism.



<P>Another is, scandal of priests; when it is come to



<P>that which St. Bernard saith, non est jam dicere,



<P>ut populus sic sacerdos; quia nec sic populus ut



<P>sacerdos.&nbsp; A third is, custom of profane scoffing in



<P>holy matters; which doth, by little and little, de-



<P>face the reverence of religion.&nbsp; And lastly, learned



<P>times, specially with peace and prosperity; for



<P>troubles and adversities do more bow men's minds



<P>to religion.&nbsp; They that deny a God, destroy man's



<P>nobility; for certainly man is of kin to the beasts,



<P>by his body; and, if he be not of kin to God, by his



<P>spirit, he is a base and ignoble creature.&nbsp; It destroys



<P>likewise magnanimity, and the raising of human



<P>nature; for take an example of a dog, and mark



<P>what a generosity and courage he will put on,



<P>when he finds himself maintained by a man; who



<P>to him is instead of a God, or melior natura; which



<P>courage is manifestly such, as that creature, with-



<P>out that confidence of a better nature than his own,



<P>could never attain.&nbsp; So man, when he resteth and



<P>assureth himself, upon divine protection and



<P>favor, gathered a force and faith, which human



<P>nature in itself could not obtain.&nbsp; Therefore, as



<P>atheism is in all respects hateful, so in this, that it



<P>depriveth human nature of the means to exalt it-



<P>self, above human frailty.&nbsp; As it is in particular



<P>persons, so it is in nations.&nbsp; Never was there such a



<P>state for magnanimity as Rome.&nbsp; Of this state hear



<P>what Cicero saith: Quam volumus licet, patres con-



<P>scripti, nos amemus, tamen nec numero Hispanos,



<P>nec robore Gallos, nec calliditate Poenos, nec arti-



<P>bus Graecos, nec denique hoc ipso hujus gentis et



<P>terrae domestico nativoque sensu Italos ipsos et



<P>Latinos; sed pietate, ac religione, atque hac una

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Nobility</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>WE WILL speak of nobility, first as a portion



<P>of an estate, then as a condition of particu-



<P>lar persons.&nbsp; A monarchy, where there is no nobil-



<P>ity at all, is ever a pure and absolute tyranny; as



<P>that of the Turks.&nbsp; For nobility attempers sover-



<P>eignty, and draws the eyes of the people, somewhat



<P>aside from the line royal.&nbsp; But for democracies,



<P>they need it not; and they are commonly more



<P>quiet, and less subject to sedition, than where there



<P>are stirps of nobles.&nbsp; For men's eyes are upon the



<P>business, and not upon the persons; or if upon the



<P>persons, it is for the business' sake, as fittest, and



<P>not for flags and pedigree.&nbsp; We see the Switzers last



<P>well, notwithstanding their diversity of religion,



<P>and of cantons.&nbsp; For utility is their bond, and not



<P>respects.&nbsp; The united provinces of the Low Coun-



<P>tries, in their government, excel; for where there



<P>is an equality, the consultations are more indif-



<P>ferent, and the payments and tributes, more



<P>cheerful.&nbsp; A great and potent nobility, addeth



<P>majesty to a monarch, but diminisheth power;



<P>and putteth life and spirit into the people, but



<P>presseth their fortune.&nbsp; It is well, when nobles are



<P>not too great for sovereignty nor for justice; and



<P>yet maintained in that height, as the insolency of



<P>inferiors may be broken upon them, before it come



<P>on too fast upon the majesty of kings.&nbsp; A numerous



<P>nobility causeth poverty, and inconvenience in a



<P>state; for it is a surcharge of expense; and besides,



<P>it being of necessity, that many of the nobility fall,



<P>in time, to be weak in fortune, it maketh a kind of



<P>disproportion, between honor and means.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As for nobility in particular persons; it is a rev-



<P>erend thing, to see an ancient castle or building,



<P>not in decay; or to see a fair timber tree, sound and



<P>perfect.&nbsp; How much more, to behold an ancient



<P>noble family, which has stood against the waves



<P>and weathers of time! For new nobility is but the



<P>act of power, but ancient nobility is the act of time.



<P>Those that are first raised to nobility, are com-



<P>monly more virtuous, but less innocent, than their



<P>descendants; for there is rarely any rising, but by



<P>a commixture of good and evil arts.&nbsp; But it is reason,



<P>the memory of their virtues remain to their pos-



<P>terity, and their faults die with themselves.&nbsp; Nobil-



<P>ity of birth commonly abateth industry; and he



<P>that is not industrious, envieth him that is.&nbsp; Besides,



<P>noble persons cannot go much higher; and he that



<P>standeth at a stay, when others rise, can hardly



<P>avoid motions of envy.&nbsp; On the other side, nobil-



<P>ity extinguisheth the passive envy from others,



<P>towards them; because they are in possession of



<P>honor.&nbsp; Certainly, kings that have able men of



<P>their nobility, shall find ease in employing them,



<P>and a better slide into their business; for people



<P>naturally bend to them, as born in some sort to



<P>command.

   <TITLE>Of Goodness and GOODNESS OF NATURE</TITLE>

</HEAD>

<BODY>





<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Goodness and GOODNESS OF NATURE</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>I TAKE goodness in this sense, the affecting of



<P>the weal of men, which is that the Grecians



<P>call philanthropia; and the word humanity (as



<P>it is used) is a little too light to express it.&nbsp; Good-



<P>ness I call the habit, and goodness of nature, the



<P>inclination.&nbsp; This of all virtues, and dignities of the



<P>mind, is the greatest; being the character of the



<P>Deity: and without it, man is a busy, mischievous,



<P>wretched thing; no better than a kind of vermin.



<P>Goodness answers to the theological virtue, char-



<P>ity, and admits no excess, but error.&nbsp; The desire of



<P>power in excess, caused the angels to fall; the desire



<P>of knowledge in excess, caused man to fall: but in



<P>charity there is no excess; neither can angel, nor



<P>man, come in dan ger by it.&nbsp; The inclination to good-



<P>ness, is imprinted deeply in the nature of man; in-



<P>somuch, that if it issue not towards men, it will



<P>take unto other living creatures; as it is seen in the



<P>Turks, a cruel people, who nevertheless are kind



<P>to beasts, and give alms, to dogs and birds; inso-



<P>much, as Busbechius reporteth, a Christian boy, in



<P>Constantinople, had like to have been stoned, for



<P>gagging in a waggishness a long-billed fowl.



<P>Errors indeed in this virtue of goodness, or charity,



<P>may be committed.&nbsp; The Italians have an ungra-



<P>cious proverb, Tanto buon che val niente: so



<P>good, that he is good for nothing.&nbsp; And one of



<P>the doctors of Italy, Nicholas Machiavel, had



<P>the confidence to put in writing, almost in plain



<P>terms, That the Christian faith, had given up good



<P>men, in prey to those that are tyrannical and un-



<P>just.&nbsp; Which he spake, because indeed there was



<P>never law, or sect, or opinion, did so much mag-



<P>nify goodness, as the Christian religion doth.



<P>Therefore, to avoid the scandal and the danger



<P>both, it is good, to take knowledge of the errors of



<P>an habit so excellent.&nbsp; Seek the good of other men,



<P>but be not in bondage to their faces or fancies; for



<P>that is but facility, or softness; which taketh an



<P>honest mind prisoner.&nbsp; Neither give thou AEsop's



<P>cock a gem, who would be better pleased, and hap-



<P>pier, if he had had a barley-corn.&nbsp; The example of



<P>God, teacheth the lesson truly: He sendeth his rain,



<P>and maketh his sun to shine, upon the just and



<P>unjust; but he doth not rain wealth, nor shine



<P>honor and virtues, upon men equally.&nbsp; Common



<P>benefits, are to be communicate with all; but pe-



<P>culiar benefits, with choice.&nbsp; And beware how in



<P>making the portraiture, thou breakest the pattern.



<P>For divinity, maketh the love of ourselves the pat-



<P>tern; the love of our neighbors, but the portraiture.



<P>Sell all thou hast, and give it to the poor, and fol-



<P>low me: but, sell not all thou hast, except thou



<P>come and follow me; that is, except thou have a



<P>vocation, wherein thou mayest do as much good,



<P>with little means as with great; for otherwise, in



<P>feeding the streams, thou driest the fountain.



<P>Neither is there only a habit of goodness, directed



<P>by right reason; but there is in some men, even in



<P>nature, a disposition towards it; as on the other



<P>side, there is a natural malignity.&nbsp; For there be,



<P>that in their nature do not affect the good of others.



<P>The lighter sort of malignity, turneth but to a



<P>crassness, or frowardness, or aptness to oppose, or



<P>difficulties, or the like; but the deeper sort, to envy



<P>and mere mischief.&nbsp; Such men, in other men's ca-



<P>lamities, are, as it were, in season, and are ever on



<P>the loading part: not so good as the dogs, that licked



<P>Lazarus' sores; but like flies, that are still buzzing



<P>upon any thing that is raw; misanthropi, that



<P>make it their practice, to bring men to the bough,



<P>and yet never a tree for the purpose in their gar-



<P>dens, as Timon had.&nbsp; Such dispositions, are the very



<P>errors of human nature; and yet they are the fittest



<P>timber, to make great politics of; like to knee tim-



<P>ber, that is good for ships, that are ordained to be



<P>tossed; but not for building houses, that shall stand



<P>firm.&nbsp; The parts and signs of goodness, are many.&nbsp; If



<P>a man be gracious and courteous to strangers, it



<P>shows he is a citizen of the world, and that his heart



<P>is no island, cut off from other lands, but a conti-



<P>nent, that joins to them.&nbsp; If he be compassionate



<P>towards the afflictions of others, it shows that his



<P>heart is like the noble tree, that is wounded itself,



<P>when it gives the balm.&nbsp; If he easily pardons, and



<P>remits offences, it shows that his mind is planted



<P>above injuries; so that he cannot be shot.&nbsp; If he be



<P>thankful for small benefits, it shows that he weighs



<P>men's minds, and not their trash.&nbsp; But above all, if



<P>he have St. Paul's perfection, that he would wish



<P>to be anathema from Christ, for the salvation of



<P>his brethren, it shows much of a divine nature, and



<P>a kind of conformity with Christ himself.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Vicissitude OF THINGS</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>SOLOMON saith, There is no new thing upon



<P>the earth.&nbsp; So that as Plato had an imagination,



<P>That all knowledge was but remembrance; so



<P>Solomon giveth his sentence, That all novelty is



<P>but oblivion.&nbsp; Whereby you may see, that the river



<P>of Lethe runneth as well above ground as below.



<P>There is an abstruse astrologer that saith, If it were



<P>not for two things that are constant (the one is,



<P>that the fixed stars ever stand a like distance one



<P>from another, and never come nearer together, nor



<P>go further asunder; the other, that the diurnal



<P>motion perpetually keepeth time), no individual



<P>would last one moment.&nbsp; Certain it is, that the mat-



<P>ter is in a perpetual flux, and never at a stay.&nbsp; The



<P>great winding-sheets, that bury all things in ob-



<P>livion, are two; deluges and earthquakes.&nbsp; As for



<P>conflagrations and great droughts, they do not



<P>merely dispeople and destroy.&nbsp; Phaeton's car went



<P>but a day.&nbsp; And the three years' drought in the time



<P>of Elias, was but particular, and left people alive.



<P>As for the great burnings by lightnings, which are



<P>often in the West Indies, they are but narrow.&nbsp; But



<P>in the other two destructions, by deluge and earth-



<P>quake, it is further to be noted, that the remnant



<P>of people which hap to be reserved, are commonly



<P>ignorant and mountainous people, that can give



<P>no account of the time past; so that the oblivion is



<P>all one, as if none had been left.&nbsp; If you consider



<P>well of the people of the West Indies, it is very



<P>probable that they are a newer or a younger peo-



<P>ple, than the people of the Old World.&nbsp; And it is



<P>much more likely, that the destruction that hath



<P>heretofore been there, was not by earthquakes (as



<P>the Egyptian priest told Solon concerning the



<P>island of Atlantis, that it was swallowed by an



<P>earthquake), but rather that it was desolated by a



<P>particular deluge.&nbsp; For earthquakes are seldom in



<P>those parts.&nbsp; But on the other side, they have such



<P>pouring rivers, as the rivers of Asia and Africk and



<P>Europe, are but brooks to them.&nbsp; Their Andes, like-



<P>wise, or mountains, are far higher than those with



<P>us; whereby it seems, that the remnants of gen-



<P>eration of men, were in such a particular deluge



<P>saved.&nbsp; As for the observation that Machiavel hath,



<P>that the jealousy of sects, doth much extinguish



<P>the memory of things; traducing Gregory the



<P>Great, that he did what in him lay, to extinguish



<P>all heathen antiquities; I do not find that those



<P>zeals do any great effects, nor last long; as it ap-



<P>peared in the succession of Sabinian, who did



<P>revive the former antiquities.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The vicissitude of mutations in the superior



<P>globe, are no fit matter for this present argument.



<P>It may be, Plato's great year, if the world should



<P>last so long, would have some effect; not in renew-



<P>ing the state of like individuals (for that is the fume



<P>of those, that conceive the celestial bodies have



<P>more accurate influences upon these things below,



<P>than indeed they have), but in gross.&nbsp; Comets, out



<P>of question, have likewise power and effect, over



<P>the gross and mass of things; but they are rather



<P>gazed upon, and waited upon in their journey,



<P>than wisely observed in their effects; specially in,



<P>their respective effects; that is, what kind of comet,



<P>for magnitude, color, version of the beams, plac-



<P>ing in the reign of heaven, or lasting, produceth



<P>what kind of effects.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There is a toy which I have heard, and I would



<P>not have it given over, but waited upon a little.



<P>They say it is observed in the Low Countries (I



<P>know not in what part) that every five and thirty



<P>years, the same kind and suit of years and weath-



<P>ers come about again; as great frosts, great wet,



<P>great droughts, warm winters, summers with little



<P>heat, and the like; and they call it the Prime.&nbsp; It is



<P>a thing I do the rather mention, because, comput-



<P>ing backwards, I have found some concurrence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But to leave these points of nature, and to come



<P>to men.&nbsp; The greatest vicissitude of things amongst



<P>men, is the vicissitude of sects and religions.&nbsp; For



<P>those orbs rule in men's minds most.&nbsp; The true re-



<P>ligion is built upon the rock; the rest are tossed,



<P>upon the waves of time.&nbsp; To speak, therefore, of the



<P>causes of new sects; and to give some counsel con-



<P>cerning them, as far as the weakness of human



<P>judgment can give stay, to so great revolutions.



<P>When the religion formerly received, is rent by



<P>discords; and when the holiness of the professors



<P>of religion, is decayed and full of scandal; and



<P>withal the times be stupid, ignorant, and bar-



<P>barous; you may doubt the springing up of a new



<P>sect; if then also, there should arise any extrava-



<P>gant and strange spirit, to make himself author



<P>thereof.&nbsp; All which points held, when Mahomet



<P>published his law.&nbsp; If a new sect have not two prop-



<P>erties, fear it not; for it will not spread.&nbsp; The one is



<P>the supplanting, or the opposing, of authority es-



<P>tablished; for nothing is more popular than that.



<P>The other is the giving license to pleasures, and a



<P>voluptuous life.&nbsp; For as for speculative heresies



<P>(such as were in ancient times the Arians, and now



<P>the Armenians), though they work mightily upon



<P>men's wits, yet they do not produce any great al-



<P>terations in states; except it be by the help of civil



<P>occasions.&nbsp; There be three manner of plantations of



<P>new sects.&nbsp; By the power of signs and miracles; by



<P>the eloquence, and wisdom, of speech and persua-



<P>sion; and by the sword.&nbsp; For martyrdoms, I reckon



<P>them amongst miracles; because they seem to ex-



<P>ceed the strength of human nature: and I may do



<P>the like, of superlative and admirable holiness of



<P>life.&nbsp; Surely there is no better way, to stop the rising



<P>of new sects and schisms, than to reform abuses; to



<P>compound the smaller differences; to proceed



<P>mildly, and not with sanguinary persecutions;



<P>and rather to take off the principal authors by win-



<P>ning and advancing them, than to enrage them



<P>by violence and bitterness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The changes and vicissitude in wars are many;



<P>but chiefly in three things; in the seats or stages of



<P>the war; in the weapons; and in the manner of the



<P>conduct.&nbsp; Wars, in ancient time, seemed more to



<P>move from east to west; for the Persians, Assyrians,



<P>Arabians, Tartars (which were the invaders) were



<P>all eastern people.&nbsp; It is true, the Gauls were west-



<P>ern; but we read but of two incursions of theirs:



<P>the one to Gallo-Grecia, the other to Rome.&nbsp; But east



<P>and west have no certain points of heaven; and no



<P>more have the wars, either from the east or west,



<P>any certainty of observation.&nbsp; But north and south



<P>are fixed; and it hath seldom or never been seen



<P>that the far southern people have invaded the



<P>northern, but contrariwise.&nbsp; Whereby it is manifest



<P>that the northern tract of the world, is in nature



<P>the more martial region: be it in respect of the stars



<P>of that hemisphere; or of the great continents that



<P>are upon the north, whereas the south part, for



<P>aught that is known, is almost all sea; or (which is



<P>most apparent) of the cold of the northern parts,



<P>which is that which, without aid of discipline,



<P>doth make the bodies hardest, and the courages



<P>warmest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Upon the breaking and shivering of a great state



<P>and empire, you may be sure to have wars.&nbsp; For



<P>great empires, while they stand, do enervate and



<P>destroy the forces of the natives which they have



<P>subdued, resting upon their own protecting forces;



<P>and then when they fail also, all goes to ruin, and



<P>they become a prey.&nbsp; So was it in the decay of the



<P>Roman empire; and likewise in the empire of



<P>Almaigne, after Charles the Great, every bird tak-



<P>ing a feather; and were not unlike to befall to



<P>Spain, if it should break.&nbsp; The great accessions and



<P>unions of kingdoms, do likewise stir up wars; for



<P>when a state grows to an over-power, it is like a



<P>great flood, that will be sure to overflow.&nbsp; As it hath



<P>been seen in the states of Rome, Turkey, Spain,



<P>and others.&nbsp; Look when the world hath fewest bar-



<P>barous peoples, but such as commonly will not



<P>marry or generate, except they know means to live



<P>(as it is almost everywhere at this day, except Tar-



<P>tary), there is no danger of inundations of people;



<P>but when there be great shoals of people, which go



<P>on to populate, without foreseeing means of life



<P>and sustentation, it is of necessity that once in an



<P>age or two, they discharge a portion of their people



<P>upon other nations; which the ancient northern



<P>people were wont to do by lot; casting lots what



<P>part should stay at home, and what should seek



<P>their fortunes.&nbsp; When a warlike state grows soft and



<P>effeminate, they may be sure of a war.&nbsp; For com-



<P>monly such states are grownm rich in the time of



<P>their degenerating; and so the prey inviteth, and



<P>their decay in valor, encourageth a war.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As for the weapons, it hardly falleth under rule



<P>and observation: yet we see even they, have re-



<P>turns and vicissitudes.&nbsp; For certain it is, that ord-



<P>nance was known in the city of the Oxidrakes in



<P>India; and was that, which the Macedonians



<P>called thunder and lightning, and magic.&nbsp; And it



<P>is well known that the use of ordnance, hath been



<P>in China above two thousand years.&nbsp; The conditions



<P>of weapons, and their improvement, are; First, the



<P>fetching afar off; for that outruns the danger; as



<P>it is seen in ordnance and muskets.&nbsp; Secondly, the



<P>strength of the percussion; wherein likewise ord-



<P>nance do exceed all arietations and ancient inven-



<P>tions.&nbsp; The third is, the commodious use of them; as



<P>that they may serve in all weathers; that the car-



<P>riage may be light and manageable; and the like.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For the conduct of the war: at the first, men



<P>rested extremely upon number: they did put the



<P>wars likewise upon main force and valor; pointing



<P>days for pitched fields, and so trying it out upon



<P>an even match and they were more ignorant in



<P>ranging and arraying their battles.&nbsp; After, they



<P>grew to rest upon number rather competent, than



<P>vast; they grew to advantages of place, cunning



<P>diversions, and the like: and they grew more skil-



<P>ful in the ordering of their battles.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the youth of a state, arms do flourish; in the



<P>middle age of a state, learning; and then both of



<P>them together for a time; in the declining age of a



<P>state, mechanical arts and merchandize.&nbsp; Learning



<P>hath his infancy, when it is but beginning and



<P>almost childish; then his youth, when it is luxuri-



<P>ant and juvenile; then his strength of years, when



<P>it is solid and reduced; and lastly, his old age, when



<P>it waxeth dry and exhaust.&nbsp; But it is not good to look



<P>too long upon these turning wheels of vicissitude,



<P>lest we become giddy.&nbsp; As for the philology of



<P>them, that is but a circle of tales, and therefore not



<P>fit for this writing.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Ambition</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>AMBITION is like choler; which is an humor



<P>that maketh men active, earnest, full of alac-



<P>rity, and stirring, if it be not stopped.&nbsp; But if it be



<P>stopped, and cannot have his way, it becometh



<P>adust, and thereby malign and venomous.&nbsp; So am-



<P>bitious men, if they find the way open for their



<P>rising, and still get forward, they are rather busy



<P>than dangerous; but if they be checked in their



<P>desires, they become secretly discontent, and look



<P>upon men and matters with an evil eye, and are



<P>best pleased, when things go backward; which is



<P>the worst property in a servant of a prince, or state.



<P>Therefore it is good for princes, if they use ambi-



<P>tious men, to handle it, so as they be still progres-



<P>sive and not retrograde; which, because it cannot



<P>be without inconvenience, it is good not to use such



<P>natures at all.&nbsp; For if they rise not with their service,



<P>they will take order, to make their service fall with



<P>them.&nbsp; But since we have said, it were good not to



<P>use men of ambitious natures, except it be upon



<P>necessity, it is fit we speak, in what cases they are



<P>of necessity.&nbsp; Good commanders in the wars must



<P>be taken, be they never so ambitious; for the use



<P>of their service, dispenseth with the rest; and to



<P>take a soldier without ambition, is to pull off his



<P>spurs.&nbsp; There is also great use of ambitious men, in



<P>being screens to princes in matters of danger and



<P>envy; for no man will take that part, except he be



<P>like a seeled dove, that mounts and mounts, be-



<P>cause he cannot see about him.&nbsp; There is use also of



<P>ambitious men, in pulling down the greatness of



<P>any subject that overtops; as Tiberius used Marco,



<P>in the pulling down of Sejanus.&nbsp; Since, therefore,



<P>they must be used in such cases, there resteth to



<P>speak, how they are to be bridled, that they may be



<P>less dangerous.&nbsp; There is less danger of them, if they



<P>be of mean birth, than if they be noble; and if they



<P>be rather harsh of nature, than gracious and popu-



<P>lar: and if they be rather new raised, than grown



<P>cunning, and fortified, in their greatness.&nbsp; It is



<P>counted by some, a weakness in princes, to have



<P>favorites; but it is, of all others, the best remedy



<P>against ambitious great-ones.&nbsp; For when the way



<P>of pleasuring, and displeasuring, lieth by the



<P>favorite, it is impossible any other should be over-



<P>great.&nbsp; Another means to curb them, is to balance



<P>them by others, as proud as they.&nbsp; But then there



<P>must be some middle counsellors, to keep things



<P>steady; for without that ballast, the ship will roll



<P>too much.&nbsp; At the least, a prince may animate



<P>and inure some meaner persons, to be as it were



<P>scourges, to ambitions men.&nbsp; As for the having of



<P>them obnoxious to ruin; if they be of fearful



<P>natures, it may do well; but if they be stout and



<P>daring, it may precipitate their designs, and prove



<P>dangerous.&nbsp; As for the pulling of them down, if the



<P>affairs require it, and that it may not be done with



<P>safety suddenly, the only way is the interchange,



<P>continually, of favors and disgraces; whereby



<P>they may not know what to expect, and be, as it



<P>were, in a wood.&nbsp; Of ambitions, it is less harmful,



<P>the ambition to prevail in great things, than that



<P>other, to appear in every thing; for that breeds



<P>confusion, and mars business.&nbsp; But yet it is less dan-



<P>ger, to have an ambitious man stirring in business,



<P>than great in dependences.&nbsp; He that seeketh to be



<P>eminent amongst able men, hath a great task; but



<P>that is ever good for the public.&nbsp; But he, that plots



<P>to be the only figure amongst ciphers, is the decay



<P>of a whole age.&nbsp; Honor hath three things in it: the



<P>vantage ground to do good; the approach to kings



<P>and principal persons; and the raising of a man's



<P>own fortunes.&nbsp; He that hath the best of these inten-



<P>tions, when he aspireth, is an honest man; and that



<P>prince, that can discern of these intentions in an-



<P>other that aspireth, is a wise prince.&nbsp; Generally, let



<P>princes and states choose such ministers, as are



<P>more sensible of duty than of using; and such as



<P>love business rather upon conscience, than upon



<P>bravery, and let them discern a busy nature, from



<P>a willing mind.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>IT IS a miserable state of mind, to have few



<P>things to desire, and many things to fear; and



<P>yet that commonly is the case of kings; who, being



<P>at the highest, want matter of desire, which makes



<P>their minds more languishing; and have many rep-



<P>resentations of perils and shadows, which makes



<P>their minds the less clear.&nbsp; And this is one reason



<P>also, of that effect which the Scripture speaketh of,



<P>That the king's heart is inscrutable.&nbsp; For multitude



<P>of jealousies, and lack of some predominant de-



<P>sire, that should marshal and put in order all the



<P>rest, maketh any man's heart, hard to find or



<P>sound.&nbsp; Hence it comes likewise, that princes many



<P>times make themselves desires, and set their hearts



<P>upon toys; sometimes upon a building; sometimes



<P>upon erecting of an order; sometimes upon the ad-



<P>vancing of a person; sometimes upon obtaining



<P>excellency in some art, or feat of the hand; as Nero



<P>for playing on the harp, Domitian for certainty



<P>of the hand with the arrow, Commodus for play-



<P>ing at fence, Caracalla for driving chariots, and



<P>the like.&nbsp; This seemeth incredible, unto those that



<P>know not the principle, that the mind of man, is



<P>more cheered and refreshed by profiting in small



<P>things, than by standing at a stay, in great.&nbsp; We see



<P>also that kings that have been fortunate conquer-



<P>ors, in their first years, it being not possible for



<P>them to go forward infinitely, but that they must



<P>have some check, or arrest in their fortunes, turn



<P>in their latter years to be superstitious, and melan-



<P>choly; as did Alexander the Great; Diocletian; and



<P>in our memory, Charles the Fifth; and others: for



<P>he that is used to go forward, and findeth a stop,



<P>falleth out of his own favor, and is not the thing



<P>he was.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To speak now of the true temper of empire, it is



<P>a thing rare and hard to keep; for both temper, and



<P>distemper, consist of contraries.&nbsp; But it is one thing,



<P>to mingle contraries, another to interchange them.



<P>The answer of Apollonius to Vespasian, is full of



<P>excellent instruction.&nbsp; Vespasian asked him, What



<P>was Nero's overthrow? He answered, Nero could



<P>touch and tune the harp well; but in government,



<P>sometimes he used to wind the pins too high, some-



<P>times to let them down too low.&nbsp; And certain it is,



<P>that nothing destroyeth authority so much, as the



<P>unequal and untimely interchange of power



<P>pressed too far, and relaxed too much.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This is true, that the wisdom of all these latter



<P>times, in princes' affairs, is rather fine deliveries,



<P>and shiftings of dangers and mischiefs, when they



<P>are near, than solid and grounded courses to keep



<P>them aloof.&nbsp; But this is but to try masteries with



<P>fortune.&nbsp; And let men beware, how they neglect



<P>and suffer matter of trouble to be prepared; for no



<P>man can forbid the spark, nor tell whence it may



<P>come.&nbsp; The difficulties in princes' business are many



<P>and great; but the greatest difficulty, is often in



<P>their own mind.&nbsp; For it is common with princes



<P>(saith Tacitus) to will contradictories, Sunt pler-



<P>umque regum voluntates vehementes, et inter se



<P>contrariae.&nbsp; For it is the solecism of power, to think



<P>to command the end, and yet not to endure the



<P>mean.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Kings have to deal with their neighbors, their



<P>wives, their children, their prelates or clergy, their



<P>nobles, their second-nobles or gentlemen, their



<P>merchants, their commons, and their men of war;



<P>and from all these arise dangers, if care and cir-



<P>cumspection be not used.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>First for their neighbors; there can no general



<P>rule be given (for occasions are so variable), save



<P>one, which ever holdeth, which is, that princes do



<P>keep due sentinel, that none of their neighbors do



<P>ever grow so (by increase of territory, by embrac-



<P>ing of trade, by approaches, or the like), as they



<P>become more able to annoy them, than they were.



<P>And this is generally the work of standing coun-



<P>sels, to foresee and to hinder it.&nbsp; During that trium-



<P>virate of kings, King Henry the Eighth of England,



<P>Francis the First King of France, and Charles the



<P>Fifth Emperor, there was such a watch kept, that



<P>none of the three could win a palm of ground, but



<P>the other two would straightways balance it,



<P>either by confederation, or, if need were, by a war;



<P>and would not in any wise take up peace at inter-



<P>est.&nbsp; And the like was done by that league (which



<P>Guicciardini saith was the security of Italy) made



<P>between Ferdinando King of Naples, Lorenzius



<P>Medici, and Ludovicus Sforza, potentates, the one



<P>of Florence, the other of Milan.&nbsp; Neither is the opin-



<P>ion of some of the Schoolmen, to be received, that a



<P>war cannot justly be made, but upon a precedent



<P>injury or provocation.&nbsp; For there is no question, but



<P>a just fear of an imminent danger, though there be



<P>no blow given, is a lawful cause of a war.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For their wives; there are cruel examples of



<P>them.&nbsp; Livia is infamed, for the poisoning of her



<P>husband; Roxalana, Solyman's wife, was the



<P>destruction of that renowned prince, Sultan Mus-



<P>tapha, and otherwise troubled his house and suc-



<P>cession; Edward the Second of England, his queen,



<P>had the principal hand in the deposing and mur-



<P>der of her husband.&nbsp; This kind of danger, is then to



<P>be feared chiefly, when the wives have plots, for



<P>the raising of their own children; or else that they



<P>be advoutresses.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For their children; the tragedies likewise of



<P>dangers from them, have been many.&nbsp; And gen-



<P>erally, the entering of fathers into suspicion of



<P>their children, hath been ever unfortunate.&nbsp; The



<P>destruction of Mustapha (that we named before)



<P>was so fatal to Solyman's line, as the succession of



<P>the Turks, from Solyman until this day, is sus-



<P>pected to be untrue, and of strange blood; for that



<P>Selymus the Second, was thought to be supposi-



<P>tious.&nbsp; The destruction of Crispus, a young prince of



<P>rare towardness, by Constantinus the Great, his



<P>father, was in like manner fatal to his house; for



<P>both Constantinus and Constance, his sons, died



<P>violent deaths; and Constantius, his other son, did



<P>little better; who died indeed of sickness, but after



<P>that Julianus had taken arms against him.&nbsp; The de-



<P>struction of Demetrius, son to Philip the Second of



<P>Macedon, turned upon the father, who died of



<P>repentance.&nbsp; And many like examples there are;



<P>but few or none, where the fathers had good by



<P>such distrust; except it were, where the sons were



<P>up in open arms against them; as was Selymus the



<P>First against Bajazet; and the three sons of Henry



<P>the Second, King of England.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For their prelates; when they are proud and



<P>great, there is also danger from them; as it was in



<P>the times of Anselmus, and Thomas Becket, Arch-



<P>bishops of Canterbury; who, with their croziers,



<P>did almost try it with the king's sword; and yet



<P>they had to deal with stout and haughty kings,



<P>William Rufus, Henry the First, and Henry the



<P>Second.&nbsp; The danger is not from that state, but



<P>where it hath a dependence of foreign authority;



<P>or where the churchmen come in and are elected,



<P>not by the collation of the king, or particular



<P>patrons, but by the people.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For their nobles; to keep them at a distance, it is



<P>not amiss; but to depress them, may make a king



<P>more absolute, but less safe; and less able to per-



<P>form, any thing that he desires.&nbsp; I have noted it, in



<P>my History of King Henry the Seventh of Eng-



<P>land, who depressed bis nobility; whereupon it



<P>came to pass, that his times were full of difficulties



<P>and troubles; for the nobility, though they con-



<P>tinued loyal unto him, yet did they not co-operate



<P>with him in his business.&nbsp; So that in effect, he was



<P>fain to do all things himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For their second-nobles; there is not much dan-



<P>ger from them, being a body dispersed.&nbsp; They may



<P>sometimes discourse high, but that doth little hurt;



<P>besides, they are a counterpoise to the higher no-



<P>bility, that they grow not too potent; and, lastly,



<P>being the most immediate in authority, with the



<P>common people, they do best temper popular com-



<P>motions.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For their merchants; they are vena porta; and



<P>if they flourish not, a kingdom may have good



<P>limbs, but will have empty veins, and nourish



<P>little.&nbsp; Taxes and imposts upon them, do seldom



<P>good to the king's revenue; for that that he wins in



<P>the hundred, he leeseth in the shire; the particular



<P>rates being increased, but the total bulk of trading,



<P>rather decreased.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For their commons; there is little danger from



<P>them, except it be, where they have great and po-



<P>tent heads; or where you meddle with the point of



<P>religion, or their customs, or means of life.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For their men of war; it is a dangerous state,



<P>where they live and remain in a body, and are



<P>used to donatives; whereof we see examples in the



<P>janizaries, and pretorian bands of Rome; but train-



<P>ings of men, and arming them in several places,



<P>and under several commanders, and without



<P>donatives, are things of defence, and no danger.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Princes are like to heavenly bodies, which cause



<P>good or evil times; and which have much venera-



<P>tion, but no rest.&nbsp; All precepts concerning kings,



<P>are in effect comprehended in those two remem-



<P>brances: memento quod es homo; and memento



<P>quod es Deus, or vice Dei; the one bridleth their



<P>power, and the other their will.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Riches</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>I CANNOT call riches better than the baggage



<P>of virtue.&nbsp; The Roman word is better, impedi-



<P>menta.&nbsp; For as the baggage is to an army, so is riches



<P>to virtue.&nbsp; It cannot be spared, nor left behind, but



<P>it hindereth the march; yea, and the care of it,



<P>sometimes loseth or disturbeth the victory.&nbsp; Of



<P>great riches there is no real use, except it be in the



<P>distribution; the rest is but conceit.&nbsp; So saith Solo-



<P>mon, Where much is, there are many to consume



<P>it; and what hath the owner, but the sight of it



<P>with his eyes? The personal fruition in any man,



<P>cannot reach to feel great riches: there is a custody



<P>of them; or a power of dole, and donative of them;



<P>or a fame of them; but no solid use to the owner.



<P>Do you not see what feigned prices, are set upon



<P>little stones and rarities? and what works of osten-



<P>tation are undertaken, because there might seem



<P>to be some use of great riches? But then you will



<P>say, they may be of use, to buy men out of dangers



<P>or troubles.&nbsp; As Solomon saith, Riches are as a



<P>strong hold, in the imagination of the rich man.



<P>But this is excellently expressed, that it is in imagi-



<P>nation, and not always in fact.&nbsp; For certainly great



<P>riches, have sold more men, than they have bought



<P>out.&nbsp; Seek not proud riches, but such as thou mayest



<P>get justly, use soberly, distribute cheerfully, and



<P>leave contentedly.&nbsp; Yet have no abstract nor friarly



<P>contempt of them.&nbsp; But distinguish, as Cicero saith



<P>well of Rabirius Posthumus, In studio rei ampli-



<P>ficandae apparebat, non avaritiae praedam, sed



<P>instrumentum bonitati quaeri.&nbsp; Harken also to



<P>Solomon, and beware of hasty gathering of riches;



<P>Qui festinat ad divitias, non erit insons.&nbsp; The poets



<P>feign, that when Plutus (which is Riches) is sent



<P>from Jupiter, he limps and goes slowly; but when



<P>he is sent from Pluto, he runs, and is swift of foot.



<P>Meaning that riches gotten by good means, and



<P>just labor, pace slowly; but when they come by



<P>the death of others (as by the course of inheritance,



<P>testaments, and the like), they come tumbling



<P>upon a man.&nbsp; But it mought be applied likewise to



<P>Pluto, taking him for the devil.&nbsp; For when riches



<P>come from the devil (as by fraud and oppression,



<P>and unjust means), they come upon speed.&nbsp; The



<P>ways to enrich are many, and most of them foul.



<P>Parsimony is one of the best, and yet is not inno-



<P>cent; for it withholdeth men from works of liberal-



<P>ity and charity.&nbsp; The improvement of the ground,



<P>is the most natural obtaining of riches; for it is our



<P>great mother's blessing, the earth's; but it is slow.



<P>And yet where men of great wealth do stoop to



<P>husbandry, it multiplieth riches exceedingly.&nbsp; I



<P>knew a nobleman in England, that had the great-



<P>est audits of any man in my time; a great grazier,



<P>a great sheep-master, a great timber man, a great



<P>collier, a great corn-master, a great lead-man, and



<P>so of iron, and a number of the like points of hus-



<P>bandry.&nbsp; So as the earth seemed a sea to him, in



<P>respect of the perpetual importation.&nbsp; It was truly



<P>observed by one, that himself came very hardly,



<P>to a little riches, and very easily, to great riches.



<P>For when a man's stock is come to that, that he can



<P>expect the prime of markets, and overcome those



<P>bargains, which for their greatness are few men's



<P>money, and be partner in the industries of younger



<P>men, he cannot but increase mainly.&nbsp; The gains of



<P>ordinary trades and vocations are honest; and



<P>furthered by two things chiefly: by diligence, and



<P>by a good name, for good and fair dealing.&nbsp; But the



<P>gains of bargains, are of a more doubtful nature;



<P>when men shall wait upon others' necessity, broke



<P>by servants and instruments to draw them on, put



<P>off others cunningly, that would be better chap-



<P>men, and the like practices, which are crafty and



<P>naught.&nbsp; As for the chopping of bargains, when a



<P>man buys not to hold but to sell over again, that



<P>commonly grindeth double, both upon the seller,



<P>and upon the buyer.&nbsp; Sharings do greatly enrich,



<P>if the hands be well chosen, that are trusted.&nbsp; Usury



<P>is the certainest means of gain, though one of the



<P>worst; as that whereby a man doth eat his bread,



<P>in sudore vultus alieni; and besides, doth plough



<P>upon Sundays.&nbsp; But yet certain though it be, it hath



<P>flaws; for that the scriveners and brokers do value



<P>unsound men, to serve their own turn.&nbsp; The fortune



<P>in being the first, in an invention or in a privilege,



<P>doth cause sometimes a wonderful overgrowth in



<P>riches; as it was with the first sugar man, in the



<P>Canaries.&nbsp; Therefore if a man can play the true



<P>logician, to have as well judgment, as invention,



<P>he may do great matters; especially if the times be



<P>fit.&nbsp; He that resteth upon gains certain, shall hardly



<P>grow to great riches; and he that puts all upon



<P>adventures, doth oftentimes break and come to



<P>poverty: it is good, therefore, to guard adventures



<P>with certainties, that may uphold losses.&nbsp; Monopo-



<P>lies, and coemption of wares for re-sale, where



<P>they are not restrained, are great means to enrich;



<P>especially if the party have intelligence, what



<P>things are like to come into request, and so store



<P>himself beforehand.&nbsp; Riches gotten by service,



<P>though it be of the best rise, yet when they are



<P>gotten by flattery, feeding humors, and other serv-



<P>ile conditions, they may be placed amongst the



<P>worst.&nbsp; As for fishing for testaments and executor-



<P>ships (as Tacitus saith of Seneca, testamenta et



<P>orbos tamquam indagine capi), it is yet worse; by



<P>how much men submit themselves to meaner per-



<P>sons, than in service.&nbsp; Believe not much, them that



<P>seem to despise riches; for they despise them, that



<P>despair of them; and none worse, when they come



<P>to them.&nbsp; Be not penny-wise; riches have wings,



<P>and sometimes they fly away of themselves, some-



<P>times they must be set flying, to bring in more.



<P>Men leave their riches, either to their kindred, or



<P>to the public; and moderate portions, prosper best



<P>in both.&nbsp; A great state left to an heir, is as a lure to



<P>all the birds of prey round about, to seize on him, if



<P>he be not the better stablished in years and judg-



<P>ment.&nbsp; Likewise glorious gifts and foundations, are



<P>like sacrifices without salt; and but the painted



<P>sepulchres of alms, which soon will putrefy, and



<P>corrupt inwardly.&nbsp; Therefore measure not thine



<P>advancements, by quantity, but frame them by



<P>measure: and defer not charities till death; for,



<P>certainly, if a man weigh it rightly, he that doth



<P>so, is rather liberal of another man's, than of his



<P>own.

   <TITLE>Of Dispatch</TITLE>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Dispatch</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>AFFECTED dispatch is one of the most danger-



<P>ous things to business that can be.&nbsp; It is like



<P>that, which the physicians call predigestion, or



<P>hasty digestion; which is sure to fill the body full of



<P>crudities, and secret seeds of diseases.&nbsp; Therefore



<P>measure not dispatch, by the times of sitting, but



<P>by the advancement of the business.&nbsp; And as in



<P>races it is not the large stride or high lift that makes



<P>the speed; so in business, the keeping close to the



<P>matter, and not taking of it too much at once, pro-



<P>cureth dispatch.&nbsp; It is the care of some, only to come



<P>off speedily for the time; or to contrive some false



<P>periods of business, because they may seem men



<P>of dispatch.&nbsp; But it is one thing, to abbreviate by



<P>contracting, another by cutting off . And business



<P>so handled, at several sittings or meetings, goeth



<P>commonly backward and forward in an unsteady



<P>manner.&nbsp; I knew a wise man that had it for a by-



<P>word, when he saw men hasten to a conclusion,



<P>Stay a little, that we may&nbsp; make&nbsp; an&nbsp; end&nbsp; the&nbsp;

sooner.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On the other side, true dispatch is a rich thing.



<P>For time is the measure of business, as money is



<P>of wares; and business is bought at a dear hand,



<P>where there is small dispatch.&nbsp; The Spartans and



<P>Spaniards have been noted to be of small dispatch;



<P>Mi venga la muerte de Spagna; Let my death come



<P>from Spain; for then it will be sure to be long in



<P>coming.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Give good hearing to those, that give the first



<P>information in business; and rather direct them



<P>in the beginning, than interrupt them in the con-



<P>tinuance of their speeches; for he that is put out of



<P>his own order, will go forward and backward, and



<P>be more tedious, while he waits upon his memory,



<P>than he could have been, if he had gone on in his



<P>own course.&nbsp; But sometimes it is seen, that the



<P>moderator is more troublesome, than the actor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Iterations are commonly loss of time.&nbsp; But there



<P>is no such gain of time, as to iterate often the state



<P>of the question; for it chaseth away many a frivo-



<P>lous speech, as it is coming forth.&nbsp; Long and curious



<P>speeches, are as fit for dispatch, as a robe or mantle,



<P>with a long train, is for race.&nbsp; Prefaces and pas-



<P>sages, and excusations, and other speeches of refer-



<P>ence to the person, are great wastes of time; and



<P>though they seem to proceed of modesty, they are



<P>bravery.&nbsp; Yet beware of being too material, when



<P>there is any impediment or obstruction in men's



<P>wills; for pre-occupation of mind ever requireth



<P>preface of speech; like a fomentation to make the



<P>unguent enter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Above all things, order, and distribution, and



<P>singling out of parts, is the life of dispatch; so as the



<P>distribution be not too subtle: for he that doth not



<P>divide, will never enter well into business; and he



<P>that divideth too much, will never come out of it



<P>clearly.&nbsp; To choose time, is to save time; and an un-



<P>seasonable motion, is but beating the air.&nbsp; There be



<P>three parts of business; the preparation, the debate



<P>or examination, and the perfection.&nbsp; Whereof, if



<P>you look for dispatch, let the middle only be the



<P>work of many, and the first and last the work of



<P>few.&nbsp; The proceeding upon somewhat conceived in



<P>writing, doth for the most part facilitate dispatch:



<P>for though it should be wholly rejected, yet that



<P>negative is more pregnant of direction, than an



<P>indefinite; as ashes are more generative than dust.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Revenge</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>REVENGE is a kind of wild justice; which the



<P>more man' s nature runs to, the more ought



<P>law to weed it out.&nbsp; For as for the first wrong, it



<P>doth but offend the law; but the revenge of that



<P>wrong, putteth the law out of office.&nbsp; Certainly, in



<P>taking revenge, a man is but even with his enemy;



<P>but in passing it over, he is superior; for it is a



<P>prince's part to pardon.&nbsp; And Solomon, I am sure,



<P>saith, It is the glory of a man, to pass by an offence.



<P>That which is past is gone, and irrevocable; and



<P>wise men have enough to do, with things present



<P>and to come; therefore they do but trifle with



<P>themselves, that labor in past matters.&nbsp; There is no



<P>man doth a wrong, for the wrong's sake; but



<P>thereby to purchase himself profit, or pleasure, or



<P>honor, or the like.&nbsp; Therefore why should I be



<P>angry with a man, for loving himself better than



<P>me? And if any man should do wrong, merely out



<P>of ill-nature, why, yet it is but like the thorn or



<P>briar, which prick and scratch, because they can



<P>do no other.&nbsp; The most tolerable sort of revenge, is



<P>for those wrongs which there is no law to remedy;



<P>but then let a man take heed, the revenge be such



<P>as there is no law to punish; else a man's enemy is



<P>still before hand, and it is two for one.&nbsp; Some, when



<P>they take revenge, are desirous, the party should



<P>know, whence it cometh.&nbsp; This is the more gener-



<P>ous.&nbsp; For the delight seemeth to be, not so much in



<P>doing the hurt, as in making the party repent.&nbsp; But



<P>base and crafty cowards, are like the arrow that



<P>flieth in the dark.&nbsp; Cosmus, duke of Florence, had a



<P>desperate saying against perfidious or neglecting



<P>friends, as if those wrongs were unpardonable;



<P>You shall read (saith he) that we are commanded



<P>to forgive our enemies; but you never read, that we



<P>are commanded to forgive our friends.&nbsp; But yet the



<P>spirit of Job was in a better tune: Shall we (saith



<P>he) take good at God's hands, and not be content to



<P>take evil also? And so of friends in a proportion.



<P>This is certain, that a man that studieth revenge,



<P>keeps his own wounds green, which otherwise



<P>would heal, and do well.&nbsp; Public revenges are for



<P>the most part fortunate; as that for the death of



<P>Caesar; for the death of Pertinax; for the death of



<P>Henry the Third of France; and many more.&nbsp; But



<P>in private revenges, it is not so.&nbsp; Nay rather, vindic-



<P>tive persons live the life of witches; who, as they



<P>are mischievous, so end they infortunate.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>THE speech of Themistocles the Athenian,



<P>which was haughty and arrogant, in taking



<P>so much to himself, had been a grave and wise



<P>observation and censure, applied at large to others.



<P>Desired at a feast to touch a lute, he said, He could



<P>not fiddle, but yet he could make a small town, a



<P>great city.&nbsp; These words (holpen a little with a



<P>metaphor) may express two differing abilities, in



<P>those that deal in business of estate.&nbsp; For if a true



<P>survey be taken of counsellors and statesmen,



<P>there may be found (though rarely) those which



<P>can make a small state great, and yet cannot fid-



<P>dle; as on the other side, there will be found a great



<P>many, that can fiddle very cunningly, but yet are



<P>so far from being able to make a small state great,



<P>as their gift lieth the other way; to bring a great



<P>and flourishing estate, to ruin and decay.&nbsp; And cer-



<P>tainly whose degenerate arts and shifts, whereby



<P>many counsellors and governors gain both favor



<P>with their masters, and estimation with the vulgar,



<P>deserve no better name than fiddling; being things



<P>rather pleasing for the time, and graceful to them-



<P>selves only, than tending to the weal and advance-



<P>ment of the state which they serve.&nbsp; There are also



<P>(no doubt) counsellors and governors which may



<P>be held sufficient (negotiis pares), able to manage



<P>affairs, and to keep them from precipices and



<P>manifest inconveniences; which nevertheless are



<P>far from the ability to raise and amplify an estate



<P>in power, means, and fortune.&nbsp; But be the workmen



<P>what they may be, let us speak of the work; that



<P>is, the true greatness of kingdoms and estates, and



<P>the means thereof.&nbsp; An argument fit for great and



<P>mighty princes to have in their hand; to the end



<P>that neither by over-measuring their forces, they



<P>leese themselves in vain enterprises; nor on the



<P>other side, by undervaluing them, they descend to



<P>fearful and pusillanimous counsels.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The greatness of an estate, in bulk and territory,



<P>doth fall under measure; and the greatness of



<P>finances and revenue, doth fall under computa-



<P>tion.&nbsp; The population may appear by musters; and



<P>the number and greatness of cities and towns by



<P>cards and maps.&nbsp; But yet there is not any thing



<P>amongst civil affairs more subject to error, than



<P>the right valuation and true judgment concerning



<P>the power and forces of an estate.&nbsp; The kingdom of



<P>heaven is compared, not to any great kernel or nut,



<P>but to a grain of mustard-seed: which is one of the



<P>least grains, but hath in it a property and spirit



<P>hastily to get up and spread.&nbsp; So are there states,



<P>great in territory, and yet not apt to enlarge or



<P>command; and some that have but a small dimen-



<P>sion of stem, and yet apt to be the foundations of



<P>great monarchies.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Walled towns, stored arsenals and armories,



<P>goodly races of horse, chariots of war, elephants,



<P>ordnance, artillery, and the like; all this is but a



<P>sheep in a lion's skin, except the breed and disposi-



<P>tion of the people, be stout and warlike.&nbsp; Nay, num-



<P>ber (itself) in armies importeth not much, where



<P>the people is of weak courage; for (as Virgil saith)



<P>It never troubles a wolf, how many the sheep be.



<P>The army of the Persians, in the plains of Arbela,



<P>was such a vast sea of people, as it did somewhat



<P>astonish the commanders in Alexander's army;



<P>who came to him therefore, and wished him to set



<P>upon them by night; and he answered, He would



<P>not pilfer the victory.&nbsp; And the defeat was easy.



<P>When Tigranes the Armenian, being encamped



<P>upon a hill with four hundred thousand men, dis-



<P>covered the army of the Romans, being not above



<P>fourteen thousand, marching towards him, he



<P>made himself merry with it, and said, Yonder men



<P>are too many for an embassage, and too few for a



<P>fight.&nbsp; But before the sun set, he found them enow



<P>to give him the chase with infinite slaughter.



<P>Many are the examples of the great odds, between



<P>number and courage; so that a man may truly



<P>make a judgment, that the principal point of great-



<P>ness in any state, is to have a race of military men.



<P>Neither is money the sinews of war (as it is trivially



<P>said), where the sinews of men's arms, in base and



<P>effeminate people, are failing.&nbsp; For Solon said well



<P>to Croesus (when in ostentation he showed him his



<P>gold), Sir, if any other come, that hath better iron,



<P>than you, he will be master of all this gold.&nbsp; There-



<P>fore let any prince or state think solely of his forces,



<P>except his militia of natives be of good and valiant



<P>soldiers.&nbsp; And let princes, on the other side, that



<P>have subjects of martial disposition, know their



<P>own strength; unless they be otherwise wanting



<P>unto themselves.&nbsp; As for mercenary forces (which



<P>is the help in this case), all examples show, that



<P>whatsoever estate or prince doth rest upon them,



<P>he may spread his feathers for a time, but he will



<P>mew them soon after.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The blessing of Judah and Issachar will never



<P>meet; that the same people, or nation, should be



<P>both the lion's whelp and the ass between bur-



<P>thens; neither will it be, that a people overlaid



<P>with taxes, should ever become valiant and mar-



<P>tial.&nbsp; It is true that taxes levied by consent of the



<P>estate, do abate men's courage less: as it hath been



<P>seen notably, in the excises of the Low Countries;



<P>and, in some degree, in the subsidies of England.



<P>For you must note, that we speak now of the heart,



<P>and not of the purse.&nbsp; So that although the same



<P>tribute and tax, laid by consent or by imposing, be



<P>all one to the purse, yet it works diversely upon the



<P>courage.&nbsp; So that you may conclude, that no people



<P>overcharged with tribute, is fit for empire.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Let states that aim at greatness, take heed how



<P>their nobility and gentlemen do multiply too fast.



<P>For that maketh the common subject, grow to be a



<P>peasant and base swain, driven out of heart, and in



<P>effect but the gentleman's laborer.&nbsp; Even as you



<P>may see in coppice woods; if you leave your stad-



<P>dles too thick, you shall never have clean under-



<P>wood, but shrubs and bushes.&nbsp; So in countries,&nbsp; if the



<P>gentlemen be too many, the commons will be base;



<P>and you will bring it to that, that not the hundred



<P>poll, will be fit for an helmet; especially as to the



<P>infantry, which is the nerve of an army; and so



<P>there will be great population, and little strength.



<P>This which I speak of, hath been nowhere better



<P>seen, than by comparing of England and France;



<P>whereof England, though far less in territory and



<P>population, hath been (nevertheless) an over-



<P>match; in regard the middle people of England



<P>make good soldiers, which the peasants of France



<P>do not.&nbsp; And herein the device of king Henry the



<P>Seventh (whereof I have spoken largely in the



<P>History of his Life) was profound and admirable;



<P>in making farms and houses of husbandry of a



<P>standard; that is, maintained with such a propor-



<P>tion of land unto them, as may breed a subject to



<P>live in convenient plenty and no servile condition;



<P>and to keep the plough in the hands of the owners,



<P>and not mere hirelings.&nbsp; And thus indeed you shall



<P>attain to Virgil's character which he gives to an-



<P>cient Italy:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Terra potens armis atque ubere glebae.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Neither is that state (which, for any thing I know,



<P>is almost peculiar to England, and hardly to be



<P>found anywhere else, except it be perhaps in



<P>Poland) to be passed over; I mean the state of free



<P>servants, and attendants upon noblemen and



<P>gentlemen; which are no ways inferior unto the



<P>yeomanry for arms.&nbsp; And therefore out of all ques-



<P>tions, the splendor and magnificence, and great



<P>retinues and hospitality, of noblemen and gentle-



<P>men, received into custom, doth much conduce



<P>unto martial greatness.&nbsp; Whereas, contrariwise, the



<P>close and reserved living of noblemen and gentle-



<P>men, causeth a penury of military forces.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>By all means it is to be procured, that the trunk



<P>of Nebuchadnezzar's tree of monarchy, be great



<P>enough to bear the branches and the boughs; that



<P>is, that the natural subjects of the crown or state,



<P>bear a sufficient proportion to the stranger sub-



<P>jects, that they govern.Therefore all states that are



<P>liberal of naturalization towards strangers, are fit



<P>for empire.&nbsp; For to think that an handful of people



<P>can, with the greatest courage and policy in the



<P>world, embrace too large extent of dominion, it



<P>may hold for a time, but it will fail suddenly.&nbsp; The



<P>Spartans were a nice people in point of naturaliza-



<P>tion; whereby, while they kept their compass,



<P>they stood firm; but when they did spread, and



<P>their boughs were becomen too great for their



<P>stem, they became a windfall, upon the sudden.



<P>Never any state was in this point so open to receive



<P>strangers into their body, as were the Romans.



<P>Therefore it sorted with them accordingly; for



<P>they grew to the greatest monarchy.&nbsp; Their manner



<P>was to grant naturalization (which they called jus



<P>civitatis), and to grant it in the highest degree; that



<P>is, not only jus commercii, jus connubii, jus haere-



<P>ditatis; but also jus suffragii, and jus honorum.



<P>And this not to singular persons alone, but likewise



<P>to whole families; yea to cities, and sometimes to



<P>nations.&nbsp; Add to this their custom of plantation of



<P>colonies; whereby the Roman plant was removed



<P>into the soil of other nations.&nbsp; And putting both



<P>constitutions together, you will say that it was not



<P>the Romans that spread upon the world, but it was



<P>the world that spread upon the Romans; and that



<P>was the sure way of greatness.&nbsp; I have marvelled,



<P>sometimes, at Spain, how they clasp and contain



<P>so large dominions, with so few natural Spaniards;



<P>but sure the whole compass of Spain, is a very great



<P>body of a tree; far above Rome and Sparta at the



<P>first.&nbsp; And besides, though they have not had that



<P>usage, to naturalize liberally, yet they have that



<P>which is next to it; that is, to employ, almost indif-



<P>ferently, all nations in their militia of ordinary



<P>soldiers; yea, and sometimes in their highest com-



<P>mands.&nbsp; Nay, it seemeth at this instant they are



<P>sensible, of this want of natives; as by the Prag-



<P>matical Sanction, now published, appeareth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It is certain that sedentary, and within-door



<P>arts, and delicate manufactures (that require



<P>rather the finger than the arm), have, in their na-



<P>ture, a contrariety to a military disposition.&nbsp; And



<P>generally, all warlike people are a little idle, and



<P>love danger better than travail.&nbsp; Neither must they



<P>be too much broken of it, if they shall be preserved



<P>in vigor.&nbsp; Therefore it was great advantage, in the



<P>ancient states of Sparta, Athens, Rome, and others,



<P>that they had the use of slaves, which commonly



<P>did rid those manufactures.&nbsp; But that is abolished,



<P>in greatest part, by the Christian law.&nbsp; That which



<P>cometh nearest to it, is to leave those arts chiefly to



<P>strangers (which, for that purpose, are the more



<P>easily to be received), and to contain the principal



<P>bulk of the vulgar natives, within those three



<P>kinds, - tillers of the ground; free servants; and



<P>handicraftsmen of strong and manly arts, as



<P>smiths, masons, carpenters, etc.; not reckoning



<P>professed soldiers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But above all, for empire and greatness, it im-



<P>porteth most, that a nation do profess arms, as their



<P>principal honor, study, and occupation.&nbsp; For the



<P>things which we formerly have spoken of, are but



<P>habilitations towards arms; and what is habilita-



<P>tion without intention and act? Romulus, after his



<P>death (as they report or feign), sent a present to the



<P>Romans, that above all, they should intend arms;



<P>and then they should prove the greatest empire of



<P>the world.&nbsp; The fabric of the state of Sparta was



<P>wholly (though not wisely) framed and composed,



<P>to that scope and end.&nbsp; The Persians and Macedo-



<P>nians had it for a flash.&nbsp; The Gauls, Germans,



<P>Goths, Saxons, Normans, and others, had it for a



<P>time.&nbsp; The Turks have it at this day, though in great



<P>declination.&nbsp; Of Christian Europe, they that have it



<P>are, in effect, only the Spaniards.&nbsp; But it is so



<P>plain, that every man profiteth in that, he most



<P>intendeth, that it needeth not to be stood upon.&nbsp; It



<P>is enough to point at it; that no nation which doth



<P>not directly profess arms, may look to have great-



<P>ness fall into their mouths.&nbsp; And on the other side,



<P>it is a most certain oracle of time, that those states



<P>that continue long in that profession (as the Ro-



<P>mans and Turks principally have done) do won-



<P>ders.&nbsp; And those that have professed arms but for



<P>an age, have, notwithstanding, commonly at-



<P>tained that greatness, in that age, which main-



<P>tained them long after, when their profession and



<P>exercise of arms hath grown to decay.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Incident to this point is, for a state to have those



<P>laws or customs, which may reach forth unto them



<P>just occasions (as may be pretended) of war.&nbsp; For



<P>there is that justice, imprinted in the nature of



<P>men, that they enter not upon wars (whereof so



<P>many calamities do ensue) but upon some, at the



<P>least specious, grounds and quarrels.&nbsp; The Turk



<P>hath at hand, for cause of war, the propagation of



<P>his law or sect; a quarrel that he may always com-



<P>mand.&nbsp; The Romans, though they esteemed the



<P>extending the limits of their empire, to be great



<P>honor to their generals, when it was done, yet they



<P>never rested upon that alone, to begin a war.&nbsp; First,



<P>therefore, let nations that pretend to greatness



<P>have this; that they be sensible of wrongs, either



<P>upon borderers, merchants, or politic ministers;



<P>and that they sit not too long upon a provocation.



<P>Secondly, let them be prest, and ready to give aids



<P>and succors, to their confederates; as it ever was



<P>with the Romans; insomuch, as if the confederate



<P>had leagues defensive, with divers other states,



<P>and, upon invasion offered, did implore their aids



<P>severally, yet the Romans would ever be the fore-



<P>most, and leave it to none other to have the honor.



<P>As for the wars which were anciently made, on



<P>the behalf of a kind of party, or tacit conformity of



<P>estate, I do not see how they may be well justified:



<P>as when the Romans made a war, for the liberty of



<P>Grecia; or when the Lacedaemonians and Athe-



<P>nians, made wars to set up or pull down democ-



<P>racies and oligarchies; or when wars were made



<P>by foreigners, under the pretence of justice or pro-



<P>tection, to deliver the subjects of others, from



<P>tyranny and oppression; and the like.&nbsp; Let it suf-



<P>fice, that no estate expect to be great, that is not



<P>awake upon any just occasion of arming.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>No body can be healthful without exercise,



<P>neither natural body nor politic; and certainly to



<P>a kingdom or estate, a just and honorable war, is



<P>the true exercise.&nbsp; A civil war, indeed, is like the



<P>heat of a fever; but a foreign war is like the heat of



<P>exercise, and serveth to keep the body in health;



<P>for in a slothful peace, both courages will effemi-



<P>nate, and manners corrupt.&nbsp; But howsoever it be



<P>for happiness, without all question, for greatness,



<P>it maketh to be still for the most part in arms; and



<P>the strength of a veteran army (though it be a



<P>chargeable business) always on foot, is that which



<P>commonly giveth the law, or at least the reputa-



<P>tion, amongst all neighbor states; as may well be



<P>seen in Spain, which hath had, in one part or other,



<P>a veteran army almost continually, now by the



<P>space of six score years.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To be master of the sea, is an abridgment of a



<P>monarchy.&nbsp; Cicero, writing to Atticus of Pompey



<P>his preparation against Caesar, saith, Consilium



<P>Pompeii plane Themistocleum est; putat enim,



<P>qui mari potitur, eum rerum potiri.&nbsp; And, without



<P>doubt, Pompey had tired out Caesar, if upon vain



<P>confidence, he had not left that way.&nbsp; We see the



<P>great effects of battles bv sea.&nbsp; The battle of Actium,



<P>decided the empire of the world.&nbsp; The battle of Le-



<P>panto, arrested the greatness of the Turk.&nbsp; There be



<P>many examples, where sea-fights have been final



<P>to the war; but this is when princes or states have



<P>set up their rest, upon the battles.&nbsp; But thus much



<P>is certain, that he that commands the sea, is at



<P>great liberty, and may take as much, and as little,



<P>of the war as he will.&nbsp; Whereas those that be strong-



<P>est by land, are many times nevertheless in great



<P>straits.&nbsp; Surely, at this day, with us of Europe, the



<P>vantage of strength at sea (which is one of the prin-



<P>cipal dowries of this kingdom of Great Britain) is



<P>great; both because most of the kingdoms of Eu-



<P>rope, are not merely inland, but girt with the sea



<P>most part of their compass; and because the wealth



<P>of both Indies seems in great part, but an accessory



<P>to the command of the seas.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The wars of latter ages seem to be made in the



<P>dark, in respect of the glory, and honor, which



<P>reflected upon men from the wars, in ancient time.



<P>There be now, for martial encouragement, some



<P>degrees and orders of chivalry; which nevertheless



<P>are conferred promiscuously, upon soldiers and



<P>no soldiers; and some remembrance perhaps, upon



<P>the scutcheon; and some hospitals for maimed sol-



<P>diers; and such like things.&nbsp; But in ancient times,



<P>the trophies erected upon the place of the victory;



<P>the funeral laudatives and monuments for those



<P>that died in the wars; the crowns and garlands per-



<P>sonal; the style of emperor, which the great kings



<P>of the world after borrowed; the triumphs of the



<P>generals, upon their return; the great donatives



<P>and largesses, upon the disbanding of the armies;



<P>were things able to inflame all men's courages.



<P>But above all, that of the triumph, amongst the



<P>Romans, was not pageants or gaudery, but one of



<P>the wisest and noblest institutions, that ever was.



<P>For it contained three things: honor to the general;



<P>riches to the treasury out of the spoils; and dona-



<P>tives to the army.&nbsp; But that honor, perhaps were not



<P>fit for monarchies; except it be in the person of the



<P>monarch himself, or his sons; as it came to pass in



<P>the times of the Roman emperors, who did impro-



<P>priate the actual triumphs to themselves, and their



<P>sons, for such wars as they did achieve in person;



<P>and left only, for wars achieved by subjects, some



<P>triumphal garments and ensigns to the general.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To conclude: no man can by care taking (as the



<P>Scripture saith) add a cubit to his stature, in this



<P>little model of a man's body; but in the great frame



<P>of kingdoms and commonwealths, it is in the



<P>power of princes or estates, to add amplitude and



<P>greatness to their kingdoms; for by introducing



<P>such ordinances, constitutions, and customs, as we



<P>have now touched, they may sow greatness to



<P>their posterity and succession.&nbsp; But these things are



<P>commonly not observed, but left to take their



<P>chance.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Counsel</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>THE greatest trust, between man and man, is



<P>the trust of giving counsel.&nbsp; For in other con-



<P>fidences, men commit the parts of life; their lands,



<P>their goods, their children, their credit, some par-



<P>ticular affair; but to such as they make their coun-



<P>sellors, they commit the whole: by how much the



<P>more, they are obliged to all faith and integrity.



<P>The wisest princes need not think it any diminu-



<P>tion to their greatness, or derogation to their suf-



<P>ficiency, to rely upon counsel.&nbsp; God himself is not



<P>without, but hath made it one of the great names



<P>of his blessed Son: The Counsellor.&nbsp; Solomon hath



<P>pronounced, that in counsel is stability.&nbsp; Things



<P>will have their first, or second agitation: if they be



<P>not tossed upon the arguments of counsel, they



<P>will be tossed upon the waves of fortune; and be



<P>full of inconstancy, doing and undoing, like the



<P>reeling of a drunken man.&nbsp; Solomon's son found



<P>the force of counsel, as his father saw the necessity



<P>of it.&nbsp; For the beloved kingdom of God, was first



<P>rent, and broken, by ill counsel; upon which coun-



<P>sel, there are set for our instruction, the two marks



<P>whereby bad counsel is for ever best discerned;



<P>that it was young counsel, for the person; and



<P>violent counsel, for the matter.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The ancient times, do set forth in figure, both



<P>the incorporation, and inseparable conjunction, of



<P>counsel with kings, and the wise and politic use of



<P>counsel by kings: the one, in that they say Jupi-



<P>ter did marry Metis, which signifieth counsel;



<P>whereby they intend that Sovereignty, is married



<P>to Counsel: the other in that which followeth,



<P>which was thus: They say, after Jupiter was mar-



<P>ried to Metis, she conceived by him, and was with



<P>child, but Jupiter suffered her not to stay, till she



<P>brought forth, but eat her up; whereby he became



<P>himself with child, and was delivered of Pallas



<P>armed, out of his head.&nbsp; Which monstrous fable



<P>containeth a secret of empire; how kings are to



<P>make use of their counsel of state.&nbsp; That first, they



<P>ought to refer matters unto them, which is the first



<P>begetting, or impregnation; but when they are



<P>elaborate, moulded, and shaped in the womb of



<P>their counsel, and grow ripe, and ready to be



<P>brought forth, that then they suffer not their coun-



<P>sel to go through with the resolution and direc-



<P>tion, as if it depended on them; but take the matter



<P>back into their own hands, and make it appear to



<P>the world, that the decrees and final directions



<P>(which, because they come forth, with prudence



<P>and power, are resembled to Pallas armed) pro-



<P>ceeded from themselves; and not only from their



<P>authority, but (the more to add reputation to them-



<P>selves) from their head and device.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Let us now speak of the inconveniences of coun-



<P>sel, and of the remedies.&nbsp; The inconveniences that



<P>have been noted, in calling and using counsel, are



<P>three.&nbsp; First, the revealing of affairs, whereby they



<P>become less secret.&nbsp; Secondly, the weakening of the



<P>authority of princes, as if they were less of them-



<P>selves.&nbsp; Thirdly, the danger of being unfaithfully



<P>counselled, and more for the good of them that



<P>counsel, than of him that is counselled.&nbsp; For which



<P>inconveniences, the doctrine of Italy, and practice



<P>of France, in some kings' times, hath introduced



<P>cabinet counsels; a remedy worse than the disease.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As to secrecy; princes are not bound to commu-



<P>nicate all matters, with all counsellors; but may



<P>extract and select.&nbsp; Neither is it necessary, that he



<P>that consulteth what he should do, should declare



<P>what he will do.&nbsp; But let princes beware, that the



<P>unsecreting of their affairs, comes not from them-



<P>selves.&nbsp; And as for cabinet counsels, it may be their



<P>motto, plenus rimarum sum: one futile person,



<P>that maketh it his glory to tell, will do more hurt



<P>than many, that know it their duty to conceal.&nbsp; It is



<P>true there be some affairs, which require extreme



<P>secrecy, which will hardly go beyond one or two



<P>persons, besides the king: neither are those coun-



<P>sels unprosperous; for, besides the secrecy, they



<P>conunonly go on constantly, in one spirit of direc-



<P>tion, without distraction.&nbsp; But then it must be a



<P>prudent king, such as is able to grind with a hand-



<P>mill; and those inward counsellors had need also



<P>be wise men, and especially true and trusty to the



<P>king's ends; as it was with King Henry the Seventh



<P>of England, who, in his great business, imparted



<P>himself to none, except it were to Morton and Fox.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For weakening of authority; the fable showeth



<P>the remedy.&nbsp; Nay, the majesty of kings, is rather



<P>exalted than diminished, when they are in the



<P>chair of counsel; neither was there ever prince, be-



<P>reaved of his dependences, by his counsel, except



<P>where there hath been, either an over-greatness



<P>in one counsellor, or an over-strict combination in



<P>divers; which are things soon found, and holpen.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For the last inconvenience, that men will coun-



<P>sel, with an eye to themselves; certainly, non



<P>inveniet fidem super terram is meant, of the na-



<P>ture of times, and not of all particular persons.



<P>There be, that are in nature faithful, and sincere,



<P>and plain, and direct; not crafty and involved; let



<P>princes, above all, draw to themselves such na-



<P>tures.&nbsp; Besides, counsellors are not commonly so



<P>united, but that one counsellor, keepeth sentinel



<P>over another; so that if any do counsel out of fac-



<P>tion or private ends, it commonly comes to the



<P>king's ear.&nbsp; But the best remedy is, if princes know



<P>their counsellors, as well as their counsellors



<P>know them:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Principis est virtus maxima nosse suos.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And on the other side, counsellors should not be



<P>too speculative into their sovereign's person.&nbsp; The



<P>true composition of a counsellor, is rather to be



<P>skilful in their master's business, than in his na-



<P>ture; for then he is like to advise him, and not feed



<P>his humor.&nbsp; It is of singular use to princes, if they



<P>take the opinions of their counsel, both separately



<P>and together.&nbsp; For private opinion is more free;



<P>but opinion before others, is more reverent.&nbsp; In



<P>private, men are more bold in their own humors;



<P>and in consort, men are more obnoxious to others'



<P>humors; therefore it is good to take both; and of



<P>the inferior sort, rather in private, to preserve free-



<P>dom; of the greater, rather in consort, to preserve



<P>respect.&nbsp; It is in vain for princes, to take counsel



<P>concerning matters, if they take no counsel like-



<P>wise concerning persons; for all matters are as



<P>dead images; and the life of the execution of af-



<P>fairs, resteth in the good choice of persons.&nbsp; Neither



<P>is it enough, to consult concerning persons secun-



<P>dum genera, as in an idea, or mathematical de-



<P>scription, what the kind and character of the



<P>person should be; for the greatest errors are com-



<P>mitted, and the most judgment is shown, in the



<P>choice of individuals.&nbsp; It was truly said, optimi con-



<P>siliarii mortui: books will speak plain, when coun-



<P>sellors blanch.Therefore it is good to be conversant



<P>in them, specially the books of such as themselves



<P>have been actors upon the stage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The counsels at this day, in most places, are but



<P>familiar meetings, where matters are rather talked



<P>on, than debated.&nbsp; And they run too swift, to the



<P>order, or act, of counsel.&nbsp; It were better that in



<P>causes of weight, the matter were propounded one



<P>day, and not spoken to till the next day; in nocte



<P>consilium.&nbsp; So was it done in the Commission of



<P>Union, between England and Scotland; which



<P>was a grave and orderly assembly.&nbsp; I commend set



<P>days for petitions; for both it gives the sudtors more



<P>certainty for their attendance, and it frees the



<P>meetings for matters of estate, that they may hoc



<P>agere.&nbsp; In choice of committees; for ripening busi-



<P>ness for the counsel, it is better to choose indifferent



<P>persons, than to make an indifferency, by putting



<P>in those, that are strong on both sides.&nbsp; I commend



<P>also standing commissions; as for trade, for treas-



<P>ure, for war, for suits, for some provinces; for



<P>where there be divers particular counsels, and but



<P>one counsel of estate (as it is in Spain), they are, in



<P>effect, no more than standing commissions: save



<P>that they have greater authority.&nbsp; Let such as are



<P>to inform counsels, out of their particular profes-



<P>sions (as lawyers, seamen, mintmen, and the like)



<P>be first heard before committees; and then, as oc-



<P>casion serves, before the counsel.&nbsp; And let them not



<P>come in multitudes, or in a tribunitious manner;



<P>for that is to clamor counsels, not to inform them.



<P>A long table and a square table, or seats about the



<P>walls, seem things of form, but are things of sub-



<P>stance; for at a long table a few at the upper end, in



<P>effect, sway all the business; but in the other form,



<P>there is more use of the counsellors' opinions, that



<P>sit lower.&nbsp; A king, when he presides in counsel, let



<P>him beware how he opens his own inclination too



<P>much, in that which he propoundeth; for else



<P>counsellors will but take the wind of him, and in-



<P>stead of giving free counsel, sing him a song of



<P>placebo.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Vain-glory</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>IT WAS prettily devised of AEsop, The fly sat



<P>upon the axle-tree of the chariot wheel, and



<P>said, What a dust do I raise! So are there some vain



<P>persons, that whatsoever goeth alone, or moveth



<P>upon greater means, if they have never so little



<P>hand in it, they think it is they that carry it.&nbsp; They



<P>that are glorious, must needs be factious; for all



<P>bravery stands upon comparisons.&nbsp; They must



<P>needs be violent, to make good their own vaunts.



<P>Neither can they be secret, and therefore not ef-



<P>fectual; but according to the French proverb,



<P>Beaucoup de bruit, peu de fruit; Much bruit little



<P>fruit.&nbsp; Yet certainly, there is use of this quality in



<P>civil affairs.&nbsp; Where there is an opinion and fame to



<P>be created, either of virtue or greatness, these men



<P>are good trumpeters.&nbsp; Again, as Titus Livius noteth,



<P>in the case of Antiochus and the AEtolians, There



<P>are sometimes great effects, of cross lies; as if a



<P>man, that negotiates between two princes, to draw



<P>them to join in a war against the third, doth extol



<P>the forces of either of them, above measure, the



<P>one to the other: and sometimes he that deals be-



<P>tween man and man, raiseth his own credit with



<P>both, by pretending greater interest than he hath



<P>in either.&nbsp; And in these and the like kinds, it often



<P>falls out, that somewhat is produced of nothing;



<P>for lies are sufficient to breed opinion, and opinion



<P>brings on substance.&nbsp; In militar commanders and



<P>soldiers, vain-glory is an essential point; for as



<P>iron sharpens iron, so by glory, one courage sharp-



<P>eneth another.&nbsp; In cases of great enterprise upon



<P>charge and adventure, a composition of glorious



<P>natures, doth put life into business; and those that



<P>are of solid and sober natures, have more of the



<P>ballast, than of the sail.&nbsp; In fame of learning, the



<P>flight will be slow without some feathers of osten-



<P>tation.&nbsp; Qui de contemnenda gloria libros scri-



<P>bunt, nomen, suum inscribunt.&nbsp; Socrates, Aristotle,



<P>Galen, were men full of ostentation.&nbsp; Certainly



<P>vain-glory helpeth to perpetuate a man's memory;



<P>and virtue was never so beholding to human na-



<P>ture, as it received his due at the second hand.



<P>Neither had the fame of Cicero, Seneca, Plinius



<P>Secundus, borne her age so well, if it had not been



<P>joined with some vanity in themselves; like unto



<P>varnish, that makes ceilings not only shine but



<P>last.&nbsp; But all this while, when I speak of vain-glory,



<P>I mean not of that property, that Tacitus doth at-



<P>tribute to Mucianus; Omnium quae dixerat fece-



<P>ratque arte quadam ostentator: for that proceeds



<P>not of vanity, but of natural magnanimity and



<P>discretion; and in some persons, is not only comely,



<P>but gracious.&nbsp; For excusations, cessions, modesty



<P>itself well governed, are but arts of ostentation.



<P>And amongst those arts, there is none better than



<P>that which Plinius Secundus speaketh of, which is



<P>to be liberal of praise and commendation to others,



<P>in that, wherein a man's self hath any perfection.



<P>For saith Pliny, very wittily, In commending



<P>another, you do yourself right; for he that you



<P>commend, is either superior to you in that you



<P>commend, or inferior.&nbsp; If he be inferior, if he be to



<P>be commended, you much more; if he be superior,



<P>if he be not to be commended, you much less.



<P>Glorious men are the scorn of wise men, the ad-



<P>miration of fools, the idols of parasites, and the



<P>slaves of their own vaunts.

   <TITLE>Of Youth AND AGE</TITLE>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Youth AND AGE</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>A MAN that is young in years, may be old in



<P>hours, if he have lost no time.&nbsp; But that hap-



<P>peneth rarely.&nbsp; Generally, youth is like the first



<P>cogitations, not so wise as the second.&nbsp; For there is



<P>a youth in thoughts, as well as in ages.&nbsp; And yet the



<P>invention of young men, is more lively than that



<P>of old; and imaginations stream into their minds



<P>better, and, as it were, more divinely.&nbsp; Natures that



<P>have much heat, and great and violent desires and



<P>perturbations, are not ripe for action, till they have



<P>passed the meridian of their years; as it was with



<P>Julius Caesar and Septimius Severus.&nbsp; Of the latter,



<P>of whom it is said, Juventutem egit erroribus, imo



<P>furoribus, plenam.&nbsp; And yet he was the ablest em-



<P>peror, almost, of all the list.&nbsp; But reposed natures



<P>may do well in youth.&nbsp; As it is seen in Augustus



<P>Caesar, Cosmus Duke of Florence, Gaston de Foix,



<P>and others.&nbsp; On the other side, heat and vivacity in



<P>age, is an excellent composition for business.



<P>Young men are fitter to invent, than to judge; fitter



<P>for execution, than for counsel; and fitter for new



<P>projects, than for settled business.&nbsp; For the experi-



<P>ence of age, in things that fall within the compass



<P>of it, directeth them; but in new things, abuseth



<P>them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The errors of young men, are the ruin of busi-



<P>ness; but the errors of aged men, amount but to



<P>this, that more might have been done, or sooner.



<P>Young men, in the conduct and manage of actions,



<P>embrace more than they can hold; stir more than



<P>they can quiet; fly to the end, without considera-



<P>tion of the means and degrees; pursue some



<P>few principles, which they have chanced upon



<P>absurdly; care not to innovate, which draws un-



<P>known inconveniences; use extreme remedies at



<P>first; and, that which doubleth all errors, will not



<P>acknowledge or retract them; like an unready



<P>horse, that will neither stop nor turn.&nbsp; Men of age



<P>object too much, consult too long, adventure too



<P>little, repent too soon, and seldom drive business



<P>home to the full period, but content themselves



<P>with a mediocrity of success.&nbsp; Certainly it is good to



<P>compound employments of both; for that will be



<P>good for the present, because the virtues of either



<P>age, may correct the defects of both; and good for



<P>succession, that young men may be learners, while



<P>men in age are actors; and, lastly, good for extern



<P>accidents, because authority followeth old men,



<P>and favor and popularity, youth.&nbsp; But for the moral



<P>part, perhaps youth will have the pre-eminence, as



<P>age hath for the politic.&nbsp; A certain rabbin, upon the



<P>text, Your young men shall see visions, and your



<P>old men shall dream dreams, inferreth that young



<P>men, are admitted nearer to God than old, because



<P>vision, is a clearer revelation, than a dream.&nbsp; And



<P>certainly, the more a man drinketh of the world,



<P>the more it intoxicateth; and age doth profit rather



<P>in the powers of understanding, than in the virtues



<P>of the will and affections.&nbsp; There be some, have an



<P>over-early ripeness in their years, which fadeth



<P>betimes.&nbsp; These are, first, such as have brittle wits,



<P>the edge whereof is soon turned; such as was Her-



<P>mogenes the rhetorician, whose books are exceed-



<P>ing subtle; who afterwards waxed stupid.&nbsp; A second



<P>sort, is of those that have some natural dispositions



<P>which have better grace in&nbsp; youth, than in age;



<P>such as is a fluent and luxuriant speech; which



<P>becomes youth well, but not age: so Tully saith of



<P>Hortensius, Idem manebat, neque idem decebat.



<P>The third is of such, as take too high a strain at the



<P>first, and are magnanimous, more than tract of



<P>years can uphold.&nbsp; As was Scipio Africanus, of



<P>whom Livy saith in effect, Ultima primis cedebant.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Nature IN MEN</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>NATURE is often hidden; sometimes over-



<P>come; seldom extinguished.&nbsp; Force, maketh



<P>nature more violent in the return; doctrine and dis-



<P>course, maketh nature less importune; but custom



<P>only doth alter and subdue nature.&nbsp; He that seeketh



<P>victory over his nature, let him not set himself too



<P>great, nor too small tasks; for the first will make



<P>him dejected by often failings; and the second will



<P>make him a small proceeder, though by often pre-



<P>vailings.&nbsp; And at the first let him practise with



<P>helps, as swimmers do with bladders or rushes;



<P>but after a time let him practise with disadvan-



<P>tages, as dancers do with thick shoes.&nbsp; For it breeds



<P>great perfection, if the practice be harder than the



<P>use.&nbsp; Where nature is mighty, and therefore the



<P>victory hard, the degrees had need be, first to stay



<P>and arrest nature in time; like to him that would



<P>say over the four and twenty letters when he was



<P>angry; then to go less in quantity; as if one should,



<P>in forbearing wine, come from drinking healths,



<P>to a draught at a meal; and lastly, to discontinue



<P>altogether.&nbsp; But if a man have the fortitude, and



<P>resolution, to enfranchise himself at once, that is



<P>the best:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Optimus ille animi vindex laedentia pectus



<P>Vincula qui rupit, dedoluitque semel.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Neither is the ancient rule amiss, to bend nature,



<P>as a wand, to a contrary extreme, whereby to set it



<P>right, understanding it, where the contrary ex-



<P>treme is no vice.&nbsp; Let not a man force a habit upon



<P>himself, with a perpetual continuance, but with



<P>some intermission.&nbsp; For both the pause reinforceth



<P>the new onset; and if a man that is not perfect, be



<P>ever in practice, he shall as well practise his errors,



<P>as his abilities, and induce one habit of both; and



<P>there is no means to help this, but by seasonable



<P>intermissions.&nbsp; But let not a man trust his victory



<P>over his nature, too far; for nature will lay buried



<P>a great time, and yet revive, upon the occasion or



<P>temptation.&nbsp; Like as it was with AEsop's damsel,



<P>turned from a cat to a woman, who sat very de-



<P>mutely at the board's end, till a mouse ran before



<P>her.&nbsp; Therefore, let a man either avoid the occasion



<P>altogether; or put himself often to it, that he may



<P>be little moved with it.&nbsp; A man's nature is best per-



<P>ceived in privateness, for there is no affectation;



<P>in passion, for that putteth a man out of his pre-



<P>cepts; and in a new case or experiment, for there



<P>custom leaveth him.&nbsp; They are happy men, whose



<P>natures sort with their vocations; otherwise they



<P>may say, multum incola fuit anima mea; when



<P>they converse in those things, they do not affect.



<P>In studies, whatsoever a man commandeth upon



<P>himself, let him set hours for it; but whatsoever is



<P>agreeable to his nature, let him take no care for



<P>any set times; for his thoughts will fly to it, of



<P>themselves; so as the spaces of other business, or



<P>studies, will suffice.&nbsp; A man's nature, runs either to



<P>herbs or weeds; therefore let him seasonably water



<P>the one, and destroy the other.

<P>IT HATH been an opinion, that the French are



<P>wiser than they seem, and the Spaniards seem



<P>wiser than they are.&nbsp; But howsoever it be between



<P>nations, certainly it is so between man and man.



<P>For as the Apostle saith of godliness, Having a



<P>show of godliness, but denying the power thereof;



<P>so certainly there are, in point of wisdom and suf-



<P>ficiently, that do nothing or little very solemnly:



<P>magno conatu nugas.&nbsp; It is a ridiculous thing, and



<P>fit for a satire to persons of judgment, to see what



<P>shifts these formalists have, and what prospectives



<P>to make superficies to seem body, that hath depth



<P>and bulk.&nbsp; Some are so close and reserved, as they



<P>will not show their wares, but by a dark light; and



<P>seem always to keep back somewhat; and when



<P>they know within themselves, they speak of that



<P>they do not well know, would nevertheless seem



<P>to others, to know of that which they may not well



<P>speak.&nbsp; Some help themselves with countenance



<P>and gesture, and are wise by signs; as Cicero saith



<P>of Piso, that when he answered him, he fetched



<P>one of his brows up to his forehead, and bent the



<P>other down to his chin; Respondes, altero ad fron-



<P>tem sublato,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; altero ad mentum depresso super-



<P>cilio, crudelitatem tibi non placere.&nbsp; Some think



<P>to bear it by speaking a great word, and being per-



<P>emptory; and go on, and take by admittance, that



<P>which they cannot make good.&nbsp; Some, whatsoever



<P>is beyond their reach, will seem to despise, or make



<P>light of it, as impertinent or curious; and so would



<P>have their ignorance seem judgment.&nbsp; Some are



<P>never without a difference, and commonly by



<P>amusing men with a subtilty, blanch the matter;



<P>of whom A. Gellius saith, Hominem delirum, qui



<P>verborum minutiis rerum&nbsp; frangit pondera.&nbsp; Of



<P>which kind also, Plato, in his Protagoras, bringeth



<P>in Prodius in scorn, and maketh him make a



<P>speech, that consisteth of distinction from the be-



<P>ginning to the end.&nbsp; Generally, such men in all



<P>deliberations find ease to be of the negative side,



<P>and affect a credit to object and foretell difficul-



<P>ties; for when propositions are denied, there is an



<P>end of them; but if they be allowed, it requireth a



<P>new work; which false point of wisdom is the bane



<P>of business.&nbsp; To conclude, there is no decaying mer-



<P>chant, or inward beggar, hath so many tricks to



<P>uphold the credit of their wealth, as these empty



<P>persons have, to maintain the credit of their suf-



<P>ficiency.&nbsp; Seeming wise men may make shift to get



<P>opinion; but let no man choose them for employ-



<P>ment; for certainly you were better take for busi-



<P>ness, a man somewhat absurd, than over-formal.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Plantations</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>PLANTATIONS are amongst ancient, primi-



<P>tive, and heroical works.&nbsp; When the world was



<P>young, it begat more children; but now it is old, it



<P>begets fewer: for I may justly account new plan-



<P>tations, to be the children of former kingdoms.&nbsp; I



<P>like a plantation in a pure soil; that is, where



<P>people are not displanted, to the end, to plant in



<P>others.&nbsp; For else it is rather an extirpation, than a



<P>plantation.&nbsp; Planting of countries, is like planting



<P>of woods; for you must make account to leese al-



<P>most twenty years' profit, and expect your recom-



<P>pense in the end.&nbsp; For the principal thing, that hath



<P>been the destruction of most plantations, hath



<P>been the base and hasty drawing of profit, in the



<P>first years.&nbsp; It is true, speedy profit is not to be neg-



<P>lected, as far as may stand with the good of the



<P>plantation, but no further.&nbsp; It is a shameful and



<P>unblessed thing, to take the scum of people, and



<P>wicked condemned men, to be the people with



<P>whom you plant; and not only so, but it spoileth



<P>the plantation; for they will ever live like rogues,



<P>and not fall to work, but be lazy, and do mischief,



<P>and spend victuals, and be quickly weary, and



<P>then certify over to their country, to the discredit



<P>of the plantation.&nbsp; The people wherewith you



<P>plant ought to be gardeners, ploughmen, laborers,



<P>smiths, carpenters, joiners, fishermen, fowlers,



<P>with some few apothecaries, surgeons, cooks, and



<P>bakers.&nbsp; In a country of plantation, first look about,



<P>what kind of victual the country yields of itself to



<P>hand; as chestnuts, walnuts, pineapples, olives,



<P>dates, plums, cherries, wild honey, and the like;



<P>and make use of them.&nbsp; Then consider what victual



<P>or esculent things there are, which grow speedily,



<P>and within the year; as parsnips, carrots, turnips,



<P>onions, radish, artichokes of Hierusalem, maize,



<P>and the like.&nbsp; For wheat, barley, and oats, they ask



<P>too much labor; but with pease and beans you may



<P>begin, both because they ask less labor, and be-



<P>cause they serve for meat, as well as for bread.&nbsp; And



<P>of rice, likewise cometh a great increase, and it is



<P>a kind of meat.&nbsp; Above all, there ought to be brought



<P>store of biscuit, oat-meal, flour, meal, and the like,



<P>in the beginning, till bread may be had.&nbsp; For beasts,



<P>or birds, take chiefly such as are least subject to



<P>diseases, and multiply fastest; as swine, goats,



<P>cocks, hens, turkeys, geese, house-doves, and the



<P>like.&nbsp; The victual in plantations, ought to be ex-



<P>pended almost as in a besieged town; that is, with



<P>certain allowance.&nbsp; And let the main part of the



<P>ground, employed to gardens or corn, be to a com-



<P>mon stock; and to be laid in, and stored up, and



<P>then delivered out in proportion; besides some



<P>spots of ground, that any particular person will



<P>manure for his own private.&nbsp; Consider likewise



<P>what commodities, the soil where the plantation



<P>is, doth naturally yield, that they may some way



<P>help to defray the charge of the plantation (so it be



<P>not, as was said, to the untimely prejudice of the



<P>main business), as it hath fared with tobacco in



<P>Virginia.&nbsp; Wood commonly aboundeth but too



<P>much; and therefore timber is fit to be one.&nbsp; If there



<P>be iron ore, and streams whereupon to set the mills,



<P>iron is a brave commodity where wood aboundeth.



<P>Making of bay-salt, if the climate be proper for it,



<P>would be put in experience.&nbsp; Growing silk likewise,



<P>if any be, is a likely commodity.&nbsp; Pitch and tar,



<P>where store of firs and pines are, will not fail.&nbsp; So



<P>drugs and sweet woods, where they are, cannot



<P>but yield great profit.&nbsp; Soap-ashes likewise, and



<P>other things that may be thought of.&nbsp; But moil not



<P>too much under ground; for the hope of mines is



<P>very uncertain, and useth to make the planters



<P>lazy, in other things.&nbsp; For government; let it be in



<P>the hands of one, assisted with some counsel; and



<P>let them have commission to exercise martial laws,



<P>with some limitation.&nbsp; And above all, let men make



<P>that profit, of being in the wilderness, as they have



<P>God always, and his service, before their eyes.&nbsp; Let



<P>not the government of the plantation, depend



<P>upon too many counsellors, and undertakers, in



<P>the country that planteth, but upon a temperate



<P>number; and let those be rather noblemen and



<P>gentlemen, than merchants; for they look ever to



<P>the present gain.&nbsp; Let there be freedom from cus-



<P>tom, till the plantation be of strength; and not



<P>only freedom from custom, but freedom to carry



<P>their commodities, where they may make their



<P>best of them, except there be some special cause of



<P>caution.&nbsp; Cram not in people, by sending too fast



<P>company after company; but rather harken how



<P>they waste, and send supplies proportionably; but



<P>so, as the number may live well in the plantation,



<P>and not by surcharge be in penury.&nbsp; It hath been a



<P>great endangering to the health of some planta-



<P>tions, that they have built along the sea and rivers,



<P>in marish and unwholesome grounds.&nbsp; Therefore,



<P>though you begin there, to avoid carriage and



<P>like discommodities, yet build still rather upwards



<P>from the streams, than along.&nbsp; It concerneth like-



<P>wise the health of the plantation, that they have



<P>good store of salt with them, that they may use it



<P>in their victuals, when it shall be necessary.&nbsp; If you



<P>plant where savages are, do not only entertain



<P>them, with trifles and gingles, but use them justly



<P>and graciously, with sufficient guard nevertheless;



<P>and do not win their favor, by helping them to in-



<P>vade their enemies, but for their defence it is not



<P>amiss; and send oft of them, over to the country



<P>that plants, that they may see a better condition



<P>than their own, and commend it when they re-



<P>turn.&nbsp; When the plantation grows to strength, then



<P>it is time to plant with women, as well as with



<P>men; that the plantation may spread into genera-



<P>tions, and not be ever pieced from without.&nbsp; It is the



<P>sinfullest thing in the world, to forsake or destitute



<P>a plantation once in forwardness; for besides the



<P>dishonor, it is the guiltiness of blood of many com-



<P>miserable persons.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Unity IN RELIGION</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>RELIGION being the chief band of human so-



<P>ciety, it is a happy thing, when itself is well



<P>contained within the true band of unity.&nbsp; The



<P>quarrels, and divisions about religion, were evils



<P>unknown to the heathen.&nbsp; The reason was, because



<P>the religion of the heathen, consisted rather in



<P>rites and ceremonies, than in any constant belief.



<P>For you may imagine, what kind of faith theirs



<P>was, when the chief doctors, and fathers of their



<P>church, were the poets.&nbsp; But the true God hath this



<P>attribute, that he is a jealous God; and therefore,



<P>his worship and religion, will endure no mixture,



<P>nor partner.We shall therefore speak a few words,



<P>concerning the unity of the church; what are the



<P>fruits thereof ; what the bounds; and what the



<P>means.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The fruits of unity (next unto the well pleasing



<P>of God, which is all in all) are two: the one, towards



<P>those that are without the church, the other,



<P>towards those that are within.&nbsp; For the former; it is



<P>certain, that heresies, and schisms, are of all others



<P>the greatest scandals; yea, more than corruption



<P>of manners.&nbsp; For as in the natural body, a wound,



<P>or solution of continuity, is worse than a corrupt



<P>humor; so in the spiritual.&nbsp; So that nothing, doth so



<P>much keep men out of the church, and drive men



<P>out of the church, as breach of unity.&nbsp; And there-



<P>fore, whensoever it cometh to that pass, that one



<P>saith, Ecce in deserto, another saith, Ecce in pene-



<P>tralibus; that is, when some men seek Christ, in the



<P>conventicles of heretics, and others, in an outward



<P>face of a church, that voice had need continually



<P>to sound in men's ears, Nolite exire, - Go not out.



<P>The doctor of the Gentiles (the propriety of whose



<P>vocation, drew him to have a special care of those



<P>without) saith, if an heathen come in, and hear



<P>you speak with several tongues, will he not say



<P>that you are mad? And certainly it is little better,



<P>when atheists, and profane persons, do hear of



<P>so many discordant, and contrary opinions in re-



<P>ligion; it doth avert them from the church, and



<P>maketh them, to sit down in the chair of the



<P>scorners. It is but a light thing, to be vouched in so



<P>serious a matter, but yet it expresseth well the



<P>deformity.&nbsp; There is a master of scoffing, that in his



<P>catalogue of books of a feigned library, sets down



<P>this title of a book, The Morris-Dance of Heretics.



<P>For indeed, every sect of them, hath a diverse pos-



<P>ture, or cringe by themselves, which cannot but



<P>move derision in worldlings, and depraved politics,



<P>who are apt to contemn holy things.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As for the fruit towards those that are within; it



<P>is peace; which containeth infinite blessings.&nbsp; It



<P>establisheth faith; it kindleth charity; the outward



<P>peace of the church, distilleth into peace of con-



<P>science; and it turneth the labors of writing, and



<P>reading of controversies, into treaties of mortifica-



<P>tion and devotion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Concerning the bounds of unity; the true plac-



<P>ing of them, importeth exceedingly.&nbsp; There appear



<P>to be two extremes.&nbsp; For to certain zealants, all



<P>speech of pacification is odious.&nbsp; Is it peace, Jehu,?



<P>What hast thou to do with peace? turn thee be-



<P>hind me.&nbsp; Peace is not the matter, but following,



<P>and party.&nbsp; Contrariwise, certain Laodiceans, and



<P>lukewarm persons, think they may accommodate



<P>points of religion, by middle way, and taking part



<P>of both, and witty reconcilements; as if they would



<P>make an arbitrament between God and man.&nbsp; Both



<P>these extremes are to be avoided; which will be



<P>done, if the league of Christians, penned by our



<P>Savior himself, were in two cross clauses thereof,



<P>soundly and plainly expounded: He that is not



<P>with us, is against us; and again, He that is not



<P>against us, is with us; that is, if the points funda-



<P>mental and of substance in religion, were truly



<P>discerned and distinguished, from points not



<P>merely of faith, but of opinion, order, or good in-



<P>tention.&nbsp; This is a thing may seem to many a matter



<P>trivial, and done already.&nbsp; But if it were done less



<P>partially, it would be embraced more generally.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Of this I may give only this advice, according to



<P>my small model.&nbsp; Men ought to take heed, of rend-



<P>ing God's church, by two kinds of controversies.



<P>The one is, when the matter of the point contro-



<P>verted, is too small and light, not worth the heat



<P>and strife about it, kindled only by contradiction.



<P>For, as it is noted, by one of the fathers, Christ's



<P>coat indeed had no seam, but the church's vesture



<P>was of divers colors; whereupon he saith, In veste



<P>varietas sit, scissura non sit; they be two things,



<P>unity and uniformity.&nbsp; The other is, when the



<P>matter of the point controverted, is great, but it is



<P>driven to an over-great subtilty, and obscurity; so



<P>that it becometh a thing rather ingenious, than



<P>substantial.&nbsp; A man that is of judgment and under-



<P>standing, shall sometimes hear ignorant men dif-



<P>fer, and know well within himself, that those



<P>which so differ, mean one thing, and yet they



<P>themselves would never agree.&nbsp; And if it come so



<P>to pass, in that distance of judgment, which is be-



<P>tween man and man, shall we not think that God



<P>above, that knows the heart, doth not discern that



<P>frail men, in some of their contradictions, intend



<P>the same thing; and accepteth of both? The nature



<P>of such controversies is excellently expressed, by



<P>St. Paul, in the warning and precept, that he giveth



<P>concerning the same, Devita profanas vocum novi-



<P>tates, et oppositiones falsi nominis scientiae.&nbsp; Men



<P>create oppositions, which are not; and put them



<P>into new terms, so fixed, as whereas the meaning



<P>ought to govern the term, the term in effect gov-



<P>erneth the meaning.There be also two false peaces,



<P>or unities: the one, when the peace is grounded,



<P>but upon an implicit ignorance; for all colors will



<P>agree in the dark: the other, when it is pieced up,



<P>upon a direct admission of contraries, in funda-



<P>mental points.&nbsp; For truth and falsehood, in such



<P>things, are like the iron and clay, in the toes of



<P>Nebuchadnezzar's image; they may cleave, but



<P>they will not incorporate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Concerning the means of procuring unity; men



<P>must beware, that in the procuring, or reuniting,



<P>of religious unity, they do not dissolve and deface



<P>the laws of charity, and of human society.&nbsp; There



<P>be two swords amongst Christians, the spiritual



<P>and temporal; and both have their due office and



<P>place, in the maintenance of religion.&nbsp; But we may



<P>not take up the third sword, which is Mahomet's



<P>sword, or like unto it; that is, to propagate religion



<P>by wars, or by sanguinary persecutions to force



<P>consciences; except it be in cases of overt scandal,



<P>blasphemy, or intermixture of practice against



<P>the state; much less to nourish seditions; to author-



<P>ize conspiracies and rebellions; to put the sword



<P>into the people's hands; and the like; tending to



<P>the subversion of all government, which is the



<P>ordinance of God.&nbsp; For this is but to dash the first



<P>table against the second; and so to consider men



<P>as Christians, as we forget that they are men.



<P>Lucretius the poet, when he beheld the act of Aga-



<P>memnon, that could endure the sacrificing of his



<P>own daughter, exclaimed: Tantum Religio potuit



<P>suadere malorum.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>What would he have said, if he had known of



<P>the massacre in France, or the powder treason of



<P>England? He would have been seven times more



<P>Epicure, and atheist, than he was.&nbsp; For as the tem-



<P>poral sword is to be drawn with great circumspec-



<P>tion in cases of religion; so it is a thing monstrous



<P>to put it into the hands of the common people.&nbsp; Let



<P>that be left unto the Anabaptists, and other furies.



<P>It was great blasphemy, when the devil said, I will



<P>ascend, and be like the highest; but it is greater



<P>blasphemy, to personate God, and bring him in



<P>saying, I will descend, and be like the prince of



<P>darkness; and what is it better, to make the cause



<P>of religion to descend, to the cruel and execrable



<P>actions of murthering princes, butchery of people,



<P>and subversion of states and governments? Surely



<P>this is to bring down the Holy Ghost, instead of the



<P>likeness of a dove, in the shape of a vulture or



<P>raven; and set, out of the bark of a Christian



<P>church, a flag of a bark of pirates, and assassins.



<P>Therefore it is most necessary, that the church, by



<P>doctrine and decree, princes by their sword, and



<P>all learnings, both Christian and moral, as by their



<P>Mercury rod, do damn and send to hell for ever,



<P>those facts and opinions tending to the support of



<P>the same; as hath been already in good part done.



<P>Surely in counsels concerning religion, that coun-



<P>sel of the apostle would be prefixed, Ira hominis



<P>non implet justitiam Dei.&nbsp; And it was a notable



<P>observation of a wise father, and no less ingenu-



<P>ously confessed; that those which held and per-



<P>suaded pressure of consciences, were commonly



<P>interested therein., themselves, for their own ends.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Truth</FONT></B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>WHAT is truth? said jesting Pilate,and would



<P>not stay for an answer.&nbsp; Certainly there be,



<P>that delight in giddiness, and count it a bondage to



<P>fix a belief; affecting free-will in thinking, as well



<P>as in acting.&nbsp; And though the sects of philosophers



<P>of that kind be gone, yet there remain certain dis-



<P>coursing wits, which are of the same veins, though



<P>there be not so much blood in them, as was in those



<P>of the ancients.&nbsp; But it is not only the difficulty and



<P>labor, which men take in finding out of truth, nor



<P>again, that when it is found, it imposeth upon



<P>men's thoughts, that doth bring lies in favor; but



<P>a natural, though corrupt love, of the lie itself.&nbsp; One



<P>of the later school of the Grecians, examineth the



<P>matter, and is at a stand, to think what should be



<P>in it, that men should love lies; where neither they



<P>make for pleasure, as with poets, nor for advan-



<P>tage, as with the merchant; but for the lie's sake.



<P>But I cannot tell; this same truth, is a naked, and



<P>open day-light, that doth not show the masks, and



<P>mummeries, and triumphs, of the world, half so



<P>stately and daintily as candle-lights.&nbsp; Truth may



<P>perhaps come to the price of a pearl, that showeth



<P>best by day; but it will not rise to the price of a



<P>diamond, or carbuncle, that showeth best in varied



<P>lights.&nbsp; A mixture of a lie doth ever add pleasure.



<P>Doth any man doubt, that if there were taken out



<P>of men's minds, vain opinions, flattering hopes,



<P>false valuations, imaginations as one would, and



<P>the like, but it would leave the minds, of a number



<P>of men, poor shrunken things, full of melancholy



<P>and indisposition, and unpleasing to themselves?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One of the fathers, in great severity, called poesy



<P>vinum daemonum, because it fireth the imagina-



<P>tion; and yet, it is but with the shadow of a lie.



<P>But it is not the lie that passeth through the mind,



<P>but the lie that sinketh in, and settleth in it, that



<P>doth the hurt; such as we spake of before.&nbsp; But how-



<P>soever these things are thus in men's depraved



<P>judgments, and affections, yet truth, which only



<P>doth judge itself, teacheth that the inquiry of truth,



<P>which is the love-making, or wooing of it, the



<P>knowledge of truth, which is the presence of it, and



<P>the belief of truth, which is the enjoying of it, is



<P>the sovereign good of human nature.&nbsp; The first



<P>creature of God, in the works of the days, was the



<P>light of the sense; the last, was the light of reason;



<P>and his sabbath work ever since, is the illumina-



<P>tion of his Spirit.&nbsp; First he breathed light, upon the



<P>face of the matter or chaos; then he breathed light,



<P>into the face of man; and still he breatheth and in-



<P>spireth light, into the face of his chosen.&nbsp; The poet,



<P>that beautified the sect, that was otherwise in-



<P>ferior to the rest, saith yet excellently well: It is a



<P>pleasure, to stand upon the shore, and to see ships



<P>tossed upon the sea; a pleasure, to stand in the win-



<P>dow of a castle, and to see a battle, and the adven-



<P>tures thereof below: but no pleasure is comparable



<P>to the standing upon the vantage ground of truth



<P>(a hill not to be commanded, and where the air is



<P>always clear and serene), and to see the errors, and



<P>wanderings, and mists, and tempests, in the vale



<P>below; so always that this prospect be with pity,



<P>and not with swelling, or pride.&nbsp; Certainly, it is



<P>heaven upon earth, to have a man's mind move in



<P>charity, rest in providence, and turn upon the



<P>poles of truth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To pass from theological, and philosophical



<P>truth, to the truth of civil business; it will be ac-



<P>knowledged, even by those that practise it not, that



<P>clear, and round dealing, is the honor of man's



<P>nature; and that mixture of falsehoods, is like alloy



<P>in coin of gold and silver, which may make the



<P>metal work the better, but it embaseth it.&nbsp; For these



<P>winding, and crooked courses, are the goings of the



<P>serpent; which goeth basely upon the belly, and



<P>not upon the feet.&nbsp; There is no vice, that doth so



<P>cover a man with shame, as to be found false and



<P>perfidious.&nbsp; And therefore Montaigne saith pret-



<P>tily, when he inquired the reason, why the word



<P>of the lie should be such a disgrace, and such an



<P>odious charge? Saith he, If it be well weighed, to



<P>say that a man lieth, is as much to say, as that he is



<P>brave towards God, and a coward towards men.



<P>For a lie faces God, and shrinks from man.&nbsp; Surely



<P>the wickedness of falsehood, and breach of faith,



<P>cannot possibly be so highly expressed, as in that



<P>it shall be the last peal, to call the judgments of God



<P>upon the generations of men; it being foretold,



<P>that when Christ cometh, he shall not find faith



<P>upon the earth.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Beauty</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>VIRTUE is like a rich stone, best plain set; and



<P>surely virtue is best, in a body that is comely,



<P>though not of delicate features; and that hath



<P>rather dignity of presence, than beauty of aspect.



<P>Neither is it almost seen, that very beautiful per-



<P>sons are otherwise of great virtue; as if nature were



<P>rather busy, not to err, than in labor to produce



<P>excellency.&nbsp; And therefore they prove accom-



<P>plished, but not of great spirit; and study rather



<P>behavior, than virtue.&nbsp; But this holds not always:



<P>for Augustus Caesar, Titus Vespasianus, Philip le



<P>Belle of France, Edward the Fourth of England,



<P>Alcibiades of Athens, Ismael the Sophy of Persia,



<P>were all high and great spirits; and yet the most



<P>beautiful men of their times.&nbsp; In beauty, that of



<P>favor, is more than that of color; and that of decent



<P>and gracious motion, more than that of favor.&nbsp; That



<P>is the best part of beauty, which a picture cannot



<P>express; no, nor the first sight of the life.&nbsp; There is no



<P>excellent beauty, that hath not some strangeness



<P>in the proportion.&nbsp; A man cannot tell whether



<P>Apelles, or Albert Durer, were the more trifler;



<P>whereof the one, would make a personage by geo-



<P>metrical proportions; the other, by taking the best



<P>parts out of divers faces, to make one excellent.



<P>Such personages, I think, would please nobody,



<P>but the painter that made them.&nbsp; Not but I think a



<P>painter may make a better face than ever was; but



<P>he must do it by a kind of felicity (as a musician



<P>that maketh an excellent air in music), and not by



<P>rule.&nbsp; A man shall see faces, that if you examine



<P>them part by part, you shall find never a good;



<P>and yet altogether do well.&nbsp; If it be true that the



<P>principal part of beauty is in decent motion, cer-



<P>tainly it is no marvel, though persons in years



<P>seem many times more amiable; pulchrorum



<P>autumnus pulcher; for no youth can be comely



<P>but by pardon, and considering the youth, as to



<P>make up the comeliness.&nbsp; Beauty is as summer



<P>fruits,) which are easy to corrupt, and cannot last;



<P>and for the most part it makes a dissolute youth,



<P>and an age a little out of countenance; but yet cer-



<P>tainly again, if it light well, it maketh virtue shine,



<P>and vices blush.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>THE winning of honor, is but the revealing of



<P>a man,s virtue and worth, without disadvan-



<P>tage.&nbsp; For some in their actions, do woo and effect



<P>honor and reputation, which sort of men, are



<P>commonly much talked of, but inwardly little



<P>admired.&nbsp; And some, contrariwise, darken their



<P>virtue in the show of it; so as they be undervalued



<P>in opinion.&nbsp; If a man perform that, which hath not



<P>been attempted before; or attempted and given



<P>over; or hath been achieved, but not with so good



<P>circumstance; he shall purchase more honor, than



<P>by effecting a matter of greater difficulty or virtue,



<P>wherein he is but a follower.&nbsp; If a man so temper



<P>his actions, as in some one of them he doth content



<P>every faction, or combination of people, the music



<P>will be the fuller.&nbsp; A man is an ill husband of bis



<P>honor, that entereth into any action, the failing



<P>wherein may disgrace him, more than the carry-



<P>ing of it through, can honor him.&nbsp; Honor that is



<P>gained and broken upon another, hath the quick-



<P>est reflection, like diamonds cut with facets.&nbsp; And



<P>therefore, let a man contend to excel any competi-



<P>tors of his in honor, in outshooting them, if he can,



<P>in their own bow.&nbsp; Discreet followers and servants,



<P>help much to reputation.&nbsp; Omnis fama a domesticis



<P>emanat.&nbsp; Envy, which is the canker of honor, is



<P>best extinguished by declaring a man's self in



<P>his ends, rather to seek merit than fame; and by



<P>attributing a man's successes, rather to divine



<P>Providence and felicity, than to his own virtue or



<P>policy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The true marshalling of the degrees of sovereign



<P>honor, are these: In the first place are conditores



<P>imperiorum, founders of states and common-



<P>wealths; such as were Romulus, Cyrus, Caesar,



<P>Ottoman, Ismael.&nbsp; In the second place are legis-



<P>latores, lawgivers; which are also called second



<P>founders, or perpetui principes, because they gov-



<P>ern by their ordinances after they are gone; such



<P>were Lycurgus, Solon, Justinian, Eadgar, Alphon-



<P>sus of Castile, the Wise, that made the Siete Parti-



<P>das.&nbsp; In the third place are liberatores, or salvatores,



<P>such as compound the long miseries of civil



<P>wars, or deliver their countries from servitude of



<P>strangers or tyrants; as Augustus Caesar, Vespasi-



<P>anus, Aurelianus, Theodoricus, King Henry the



<P>Seventh of England, King Henry the Fourth of



<P>France.&nbsp; In the fourth place are propagatores or



<P>propugnatores imperii; such as in honorable wars



<P>enlarge their territories, or make noble defence



<P>against invaders.&nbsp; And in the last place are patres



<P>patriae; which reign justly, and make the times



<P>good wherein they live.&nbsp; Both which last kinds need



<P>no examples, they are in such number.&nbsp; Degrees of



<P>honor, in subjects, are, first participes curarum,



<P>those upon whom, princes do discharge the great-



<P>est weight of their affairs; their right hands, as



<P>we call them.&nbsp; The next are duces belli, great leaders



<P>in war; such as are princes' lieutenants, and do



<P>them notable services in the wars.&nbsp; The third are



<P>gratiosi, favorites; such as exceed not this scant-



<P>ling, to be solace to the sovereign, and harmless to



<P>the people.&nbsp; And the fourth, negotiis pares; such as



<P>have great places under princes, and execute their



<P>places, with sufficiency.&nbsp; There is an honor, like-



<P>wise, which may be ranked amongst the greatest,



<P>which happeneth rarely; that is, of such as sacri-



<P>fice themselves to death or danger for the good of



<P>their country; as was M. Regulus, and the two



<P>Decii.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>TRAVEL, in the younger sort, is a part of edu-



<P>cation, in the elder, a part of experience.&nbsp; He



<P>that travelleth into a country, before he hath some



<P>entrance into the language, goeth to school, and



<P>not to travel.&nbsp; That young men travel under some



<P>tutor, or grave servant, I allow well; so that he be



<P>such a one that hath the language, and hath been



<P>in the country before; whereby he may be able



<P>to tell them what things are worthy to be seen, in



<P>the country where they go; what acquaintances



<P>they are to seek; what exercises, or discipline, the



<P>place yieldeth.&nbsp; For else, young men shall go



<P>hooded, and look abroad little.&nbsp; It is a strange thing,



<P>that in sea voyages, where there is nothing to be



<P>seen, but sky and sea, men should make diaries;



<P>but in land-travel, wherein so much is to be ob-



<P>served, for the most part they omit it; as if chance



<P>were fitter to be registered, than observation.&nbsp; Let



<P>diaries, therefore, be brought in use.&nbsp; The things to



<P>be seen and observed are: the courts of princes,



<P>especially when they give audience to ambassa-



<P>dors; the courts of justice, while they sit and hear



<P>causes; and so of consistories ecclesiastic; the



<P>churches and monasteries, with the monuments



<P>which are therein extant; the walls and fortifica-



<P>tions of cities, and towns, and so the heavens and



<P>harbors; antiquities and ruins; libraries; colleges,



<P>disputations, and lectures, where any are; ship-



<P>ping and navies; houses and gardens of state and



<P>pleasure, near great cities; armories; arsenals;



<P>magazines; exchanges; burses; warehouses; exer-



<P>cises of horsemanship, fencing, training of sol-



<P>diers, and the like; comedies, such whereunto the



<P>better sort of persons do resort; treasuries of jewels



<P>and robes; cabinets and rarities; and, to conclude,



<P>whatsoever is memorable, in the places where



<P>they go.&nbsp; After all which, the tutors, or servants,



<P>ought to make diligent inquiry.&nbsp; As for triumphs,



<P>masks, feasts, weddings, funerals, capital execu-



<P>tions, and such shows, men need not to be put in



<P>mind of them; yet are they not to be neglected.&nbsp; If



<P>you will have a young man to put his travel into a



<P>little room, and in short time to gather much, this



<P>you must do.&nbsp; First, as was said, he must have some



<P>entrance into the language before he goeth.&nbsp; Then



<P>he must have such a servant, or tutor, as knoweth



<P>the country, as was likewise said.&nbsp; Let him carry



<P>with him also, some card or book, describing the



<P>country where he travelleth; which will be a good



<P>key to his inquiry.&nbsp; Let him keep also a diary.&nbsp; Let



<P>him not stay long, in one city or town; more or less



<P>as the place deserveth, but not long; nay, when he



<P>stayeth in one city or town, let him change his



<P>lodging from one end and part of the town, to an-



<P>other; which is a great adamant of acquaintance.



<P>Let him sequester himself, from the company of



<P>his countrymen, and diet in such places, where



<P>there is good company of the nation where he



<P>travelleth.&nbsp; Let him, upon his removes from one



<P>place to another, procure recommendation to some



<P>person of quality, residing in the place whither he



<P>removeth; that he may use his favor, in those



<P>things he desireth to see or know.&nbsp; Thus he may



<P>abridge his travel, with much profit.&nbsp; As for the



<P>acquaintance, which is to be sought in travel; that



<P>which is most of all profitable, is acquaintance



<P>with the secretaries and employed men of ambas-



<P>sadors: for so in travelling in one country, he shall



<P>suck the experience of many.&nbsp; Let him also see, and



<P>visit, eminent persons in all kinds, which are of



<P>great name abroad; that he may be able to tell,



<P>how the life agreeth with the fame.&nbsp; For quarrels,



<P>they are with care and discretion to be avoided.



<P>They are commonly for mistresses, healths, place,



<P>and words.&nbsp; And let a man beware,&nbsp; how he keepeth



<P>company with choleric and quarrelsome persons;



<P>for they will engage him into their own quarrels.



<P>When a traveller returneth home, let him not



<P>leave the countries, where he hath travelled, alto-



<P>gether behind him; but maintain a correspond-



<P>ence by letters, with those of his acquaintance,



<P>which are of most worth.&nbsp; And let his travel appear



<P>rather in his discourse, than his apparel or gesture;



<P>and in his discourse, let him be rather advised in



<P>his answers, than forward to tell stories; and let it



<P>appear that he doth not change his country man-



<P>ners, for those of foreign parts; but only prick in



<P>some flowers, of that he hath learned abroad, into



<P>the customs of his own country.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Faction</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>MANY have an opinion not wise, that for a



<P>prince to govern his estate, or for a great



<P>person to govern his proceedings, according to the



<P>respect of factions, is a principal part of policy;



<P>whereas contrariwise, the chiefest wisdom, is



<P>either in ordering those things which are general,



<P>and wherein men of several factions do neverthe-



<P>less agree; or in dealing with correspondence to



<P>particular persons, one by one.&nbsp; But I say not that



<P>the considerations of factions, is to be neglected.



<P>Mean men, in their rising, must adhere; but



<P>great men, that have strength in themselves, were



<P>better to maintain themselves indifferent, and



<P>neutral.&nbsp; Yet even in beginners, to adhere so moder-



<P>ately, as he be a man of the one faction, which is



<P>most passable with the other, commonly giveth



<P>best way.&nbsp; The lower and weaker faction, is the



<P>firmer in conjunction; and it is often seen, that a



<P>few that are stiff, do tire out a greater number, that



<P>are more moderate.&nbsp; When one of the factions is ex-



<P>tinguished, the remaining subdivideth; as the



<P>faction between Lucullus, and the rest of the



<P>nobles of the senate (which they called Optimates)



<P>held out awhile, against the faction of Pompey



<P>and Caesar; but when the senate's authority was



<P>pulled down, Caesar and Pompey soon after brake.



<P>The faction or party of Antonius and Octavianus



<P>Caesar, against Brutus and Cassius, held out like-



<P>wise for a time; but when Brutus and Cassius were



<P>overthrown, then soon after, Antonius and Octa-



<P>vianus brake and subdivided.&nbsp; These examples are



<P>of wars, but the same holdeth in private factions.



<P>And therefore, those that are seconds in factions,



<P>do many times, when the faction subdivideth,



<P>prove principals; but many times also, they prove



<P>ciphers and cashiered; for many a man's strength



<P>is in opposition; and when that faileth, he groweth



<P>out of use.&nbsp; It is commonly seen, that men, once



<P>placed, take in with the&nbsp; contrary faction, to that



<P>by which they enter: thinking belike, that they



<P>have the first sure, and now are ready for a new



<P>purchase.&nbsp; The traitor in faction, lightly goeth



<P>away with it; for when matters have stuck long in



<P>balancing, the winning of some one man casteth



<P>them, and he getteth all the thanks.&nbsp; The even car-



<P>riage between two factions, proceedeth not always



<P>of moderation, but of a trueness to a man's self,



<P>with end to make use of both.&nbsp; Certainly in Italy,



<P>they hold it a little suspect in popes, when they



<P>have often in their mouth Padre commune: and



<P>take it to be a sign of one, that meaneth to refer all



<P>to the greatness of his own house.&nbsp; Kings had need



<P>beware, how they side themselves, and make



<P>themselves as of a faction or party; for leagues



<P>within the state, are ever pernicious to monarchies:



<P>for they raise an obligation, paramount to obliga-



<P>tion of sovereignty, and make the king tanquam



<P>unus ex nobis; as was to be seen in the League of



<P>France.&nbsp; When factions are carried too high and too



<P>violently, it is a sign of weakness in princes; and



<P>much to the prejudice, both of their authority and



<P>business.&nbsp; The motions of factions under kings



<P>ought to be, like the motions (as the astronomers



<P>speak) of the inferior orbs, which may have their



<P>proper motions, but yet still are quietly carried, by



<P>the higher motion of primum mobile.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>AS THE births of living creatures, at first are ill-



<P>shapen, so are all innovations, which are the



<P>births of time.&nbsp; Yet notwithstanding, as those that



<P>first bring honor into their family, are commonly



<P>more worthy than most that succeed, so the first



<P>precedent (if it be good) is seldom attained by



<P>imitation.&nbsp; For ill, to man's nature, as it stands



<P>perverted, hath a natural motion, strongest in con-



<P>tinuance; but good, as a forced motion, strongest



<P>at first.&nbsp; Surely every medicine is an innovation;



<P>and he that will not apply new remedies, must



<P>expect new evils; for time is the greatest innovator;



<P>and if time of course alter things to the worse, and



<P>wisdom and counsel shall not alter them to the



<P>better, what shall be the end? It is true, that what



<P>is settled by custom, though it be not good, yet at



<P>least it is fit; and those things which have long



<P>gone together, are, as it were, confederate within



<P>themselves; whereas new things piece not so well;



<P>but though they help by their utility, yet they



<P>trouble by their inconformity.&nbsp; Besides, they are



<P>like strangers; more admired, and less favored.&nbsp; All



<P>this is true, if time stood still; which contrariwise



<P>moveth so round, that a froward retention of cus-



<P>tom, is as turbulent a thing as an innovation; and



<P>they that reverence too much old times, are but a



<P>scorn to the new.&nbsp; It were good, therefore, that men



<P>in their innovations would follow the example of



<P>time itself; which indeed innovateth greatly, but



<P>quietly, by degrees scarce to be perceived.&nbsp; For



<P>otherwise, whatsoever is new is unlooked for; and



<P>ever it mends some, and pairs others; and he that



<P>is holpen, takes it for a fortune, and thanks the



<P>time; and he that is hurt, for a wrong, and imput-



<P>eth it to the author.&nbsp; It is good also, not to try experi-



<P>ments in states, except the necessity be urgent, or



<P>the utility evident; and well to beware, that it be



<P>the reformation, that draweth on the change, and



<P>not the desire of change, that pretendeth the refor-



<P>mation.&nbsp; And lastly, that the novelty, though it be



<P>not rejected, yet be held for a suspect; and, as the



<P>Scripture saith, that we make a stand upon the



<P>ancient way, and then look about us, and discover



<P>what is the straight and right way, and so to walk



<P>in it.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Of Suitors</FONT></B>



<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>MANY ill matters and projects are under-



<P>taken; and private suits do putrefy the pub-



<P>lic good.&nbsp; Many good matters, are undertaken with



<P>bad minds; I mean not only corrupt minds, but



<P>crafty minds, that intend not performance.&nbsp; Some



<P>embrace suits, which never mean to deal effectu-



<P>ally in them; but if they see there may be life in



<P>the matter, by some other mean, they will be con-



<P>tent to win a thank, or take a second reward, or at



<P>least to make use, in the meantime, of the suitor's



<P>hopes.&nbsp; Some take hold of suits, only for an occa-



<P>sion to cross some other; or to make an informa-



<P>tion, whereof they could not otherwise have apt



<P>pretext; without care what become of the suit,



<P>when that turn is served; or, generally, to make



<P>other men's business a kind of entertainment, to



<P>bring in their own.&nbsp; Nay, some undertake suits,



<P>with a full purpose to let them fall; to the end to



<P>gratify the adverse party, or competitor.&nbsp; Surely



<P>there is in some sort a right in every suit; either a



<P>right of equity, if it be a suit of controversy; or a



<P>right of desert, if it be a suit of petition.&nbsp; If affection



<P>lead a man to favor the wrong side in justice, let



<P>him rather use his countenance to compound the



<P>matter, than to carry it.&nbsp; If affection lead a man



<P>to favor the less worthy in desert, let him do it,



<P>without depraving or disabling the better deserver.



<P>In suits which a man doth not well understand, it



<P>is good to refer them to some friend of trust and



<P>judgment, that may report, whether he may deal



<P>in them with honor: but let him choose well his



<P>referendaries, for else he may be led by the nose.



<P>Suitors are so distasted with delays and abuses,



<P>that plain dealing, in denying to deal in suits at



<P>first, and reporting the success barely, and in chal-



<P>lenging no more thanks than one hath deserved,



<P>is grown not only honorable, but also gracious.&nbsp; In



<P>suits of favor, the first coming ought to take little



<P>place: so far forth, consideration may be had of



<P>his trust, that if intelligence of the matter could



<P>not otherwise have been had, but by him, advan-



<P>tage be not taken of the note, but the party left to



<P>his other means; and in some sort recompensed,



<P>for his discovery.&nbsp; To be ignorant of the value of a



<P>suit, is simplicity; as well as to be ignorant of the



<P>right thereof, is want of conscience.&nbsp; Secrecy in



<P>suits, is a great mean of obtaining; for voicing



<P>them to be in forwardness, may discourage some



<P>kind of suitors, but doth quicken and awake others.



<P>But timing of the suit is the principal.&nbsp; Timing, I



<P>say, not only in respect of the person that should



<P>grant it, but in respect of those, which are like to



<P>cross it.&nbsp; Let a man, in the choice of his mean, rather



<P>choose the fittest mean, than the greatest mean;



<P>and rather them that deal in certain things, than



<P>those that are general.&nbsp; The reparation of a denial,



<P>is sometimes equal to the first grant; if a man



<P>show himself neither dejected nor discontented.



<P>Iniquum petas ut aequum feras is a good rule,



<P>where a man hath strength of favor: but other-



<P>wise, a man were better rise in his suit; for



<P>he, that would have ventured at first to have lost



<P>the suitor, will not in the conclusion lose both the



<P>suitor, and his own former favor.&nbsp; Nothing is



<P>thought so easy a request to a great person, as his



<P>letter; and yet, if it be not in a good cause, it is so



<P>much out of his reputation.&nbsp; There are no worse



<P>instruments, than these general contrivers of suits;



<P>for they are but a kind of poison, and infection, to



<P>public proceedings.

<P>when they are frequent and open; and in like sort,



<P>false news often running up and down, to the dis-



<P>advantage of the state, and hastily embraced; are



<P>amongst the signs of troubles.&nbsp; Virgil, giving the



<P>pedigree of Fame, saith, she was sister to the Giants:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Illam Terra parens, irra irritata deorum,



<P>Extremam (ut perhibent) Coeo Enceladoque sororem



<P>Progenuit.-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As if fames were the relics of seditions past; but



<P>they are no less, indeed, the preludes of seditions to



<P>come.&nbsp; Howsoever he noteth it right, that seditious



<P>tumults, and seditious fames, differ no more but



<P>as brother and sister, masculine and feminine; es-



<P>pecially if it come to that, that the best actions of



<P>a state, and the most plausible, and which ought



<P>to give greatest contentment, are taken in ill sense,



<P>and traduced: for that shows the envy great, as



<P>Tacitus saith; conflata magna invidia, seu bene



<P>seu male gesta premunt.&nbsp; Neither doth it follow,



<P>that because these fames are a sign of troubles, that



<P>the suppressing of them with too much severity,



<P>should be a remedy of troubles.&nbsp; For the despising



<P>of them, many times checks them best; and the



<P>going about to stop them, doth but make a wonder



<P>long-lived.&nbsp; Also that kind of obedience, which



<P>Tacitus speaketh of, is to be held suspected: Erant



<P>in officio, sed tamen qui mallent mandata impe-



<P>rantium interpretari quam exequi; disputing, ex-



<P>cusing, cavilling upon mandates and directions, is



<P>a kind of shaking off the yoke, and assay of dis-



<P>obedience; especially if in those disputings, they



<P>which are for the direction, speak fearfully and



<P>tenderly, and those that are against it, audaciously.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Also, as Machiavel noteth well, when princes,



<P>that ought to be common parents, make them-



<P>selves as a party, and lean to a side, it is as a boat,



<P>that is overthrown by uneven weight on the one



<P>side; as was well seen, in the time of Henry the



<P>Third of France; for first, himself entered league



<P>for the extirpation of the Protestants; and pres-



<P>ently after, the same league was turned upon him-



<P>self.&nbsp; For when the authority of princes, is made



<P>but an accessory to a cause, and that there be other



<P>bands, that tie faster than the band of sovereignty,



<P>kings begin to be put almost out of possession.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Also, when discords, and quarrels, and factions



<P>are carried openly and audaciously, it is a sign the



<P>reverence of government is lost.&nbsp; For the motions



<P>of the greatest persons in a government, ought to



<P>be as the motions of the planets under primum



<P>mobile; according to the old opinion: which is,



<P>that every of them, is carried swiftly by the



<P>highest motion, and softly in their own motion.



<P>And therefore, when great ones in their own



<P>particular motion, move violently, and, as Tacitus



<P>expresseth it well, liberius quam ut imperan-



<P>tium meminissent; it is a sign the orbs are out



<P>of frame.&nbsp; For reverence is that, wherewith princes



<P>are girt from God; who threateneth the dissolving



<P>thereof; Solvam cingula regum.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So when any of the four pillars of government,



<P>are mainly shaken, or weakened (which are relig-



<P>ion, justice, counsel, and treasure), men had need



<P>to pray for fair weather.&nbsp; But let us pass from this



<P>part of predictions (concerning which, neverthe-



<P>less, more light may be taken from that which



<P>followeth); and let us speak first, of the materials



<P>of seditions; then of the motives of them; and



<P>thirdly of the remedies.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Concerning the materials of seditions.&nbsp; It is a



<P>thing well to be considered; for the surest way to



<P>prevent seditions (if the times do bear it) is to take



<P>away the matter of them.&nbsp; For if there be fuel pre-



<P>pared, it is hard to tell, whence the spark shall



<P>come, that shall set it on fire.&nbsp; The matter of sedi-



<P>tions is of two kinds: much poverty, and much dis-



<P>contentment.&nbsp; It is certain, so many overthrown



<P>estates, so many votes for troubles.&nbsp; Lucan noteth



<P>well the state of Rome before the Civil War,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Hinc usura vorax, rapidumque in tempore foenus,



<P>Hinc concussa fides, et multis utile bellum.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This same multis utile bellum, is an assured and



<P>infallible sign, of a state disposed to seditions and



<P>troubles.&nbsp; And if this poverty and broken estate in



<P>the better sort, be joined with a want and necessity



<P>in the mean people, the danger is imminent and



<P>great.&nbsp; For the rebellions of the belly are the worst.



<P>As for discontentments, they are, in the politic



<P>body, like to humors in the natural, which are apt



<P>to gather a preternatural heat, and to inflame.



<P>And let no prince measure the danger of them by



<P>this, whether they be just or unjust: for that were



<P>to imagine people, to be too reasonable; who do



<P>often spurn at their own good: nor yet by this,



<P>whether the griefs whereupon they rise, be in fact



<P>great or small: for they are the most dangerous



<P>discontentments, where the fear is greater than



<P>the feeling.&nbsp; Dolendi modus, timendi non item.



<P>Besides, in great oppressions, the same things that



<P>provoke the patience, do withal mate the courage;



<P>but in fears it is not so.&nbsp; Neither let any prince, or



<P>state, be secure concerning discontentments, be-



<P>cause they have been often, or have been long, and



<P>yet no peril hath ensued: for as it is true, that every



<P>vapor or fume doth not turn into a storm; so it is



<P>nevertheless true, that storms, though they blow



<P>over divers times, yet may fall at last; and, as the



<P>Spanish proverb noteth well, The cord breaketh at



<P>the last by the weakest pull.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The causes and motives of seditions are, innova-



<P>tion in religion; taxes; alteration of laws and cus-



<P>toms; breaking of privileges; general oppression;



<P>advancement of unworthy persons; strangers;



<P>dearths; disbanded soldiers; factions grown des-



<P>perate; and what soever, in offending people,



<P>joineth and knitteth them in a common cause.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For the remedies; there may be some general



<P>preservatives, whereof we will speak: as for the



<P>just cure, it must answer to the particular disease;



<P>and so be left to counsel, rather than rule.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The first remedy or prevention is to remove, by



<P>all means possible, that material cause of sedition



<P>whereof we spake; which is, want and poverty in



<P>the estate.&nbsp; To which purpose serveth the opening,



<P>and well-balancing of trade; the cherishing of



<P>manufactures; the banishing of idleness; the re-



<P>pressing of waste, and excess, by sumptuary laws;



<P>the improvement and husbanding of the soil; the



<P>regulating of prices of things vendible; the moder-



<P>ating of taxes and tributes; and the like.&nbsp; Generally,



<P>it is to be foreseen that the population of a king-



<P>dom (especially if it be not mown down by wars)



<P>do not exceed the stock of the kingdom, which



<P>should maintain them.&nbsp; Neither is the population



<P>to be reckoned only by number; for a smaller num-



<P>ber, that spend more and earn less, do wear out an



<P>estate sooner, than a greater number that live



<P>lower, and gather more.&nbsp; Therefore the multiply-



<P>ing of nobility, and other degrees of quality, in an



<P>over proportion to the common people, doth speed-



<P>ily bring a state to necessity; and so doth likewise



<P>an overgrown clergy; for they bring nothing to



<P>the stock; and in like manner, when more are bred



<P>scholars, than preferments can take off .

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It is likewise to be remembered, that forasmuch



<P>as the increase of any estate must be upon the



<P>foreigner (for whatsoever is somewhere gotten, is



<P>somewhere lost), there be but three things, which



<P>one nation selleth unto another; the commodity as



<P>nature yieldeth it; the manufacture; and the vec-



<P>ture, or carriage.&nbsp; So that if these three wheels go,



<P>wealth will flow as in a spring tide.&nbsp; And it cometh



<P>many times to pass, that materiam superabit opus;



<P>that the work and carriage is more worth than the



<P>material, and enricheth a state more; as is notably



<P>seen in the Low-Countrymen, who have the best



<P>mines above ground, in the world.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Above all things, good policy is to be used, that



<P>the treasure and moneys, in a state, be not gath-



<P>ered into few hands.&nbsp; For otherwise a state may



<P>have a great stock, and yet starve.&nbsp; And money is



<P>like muck, not good except it be spread.&nbsp; This is



<P>done, chiefly by suppressing, or at least keeping



<P>a strait hand, upon the devouring trades of usury,



<P>ingrossing great pasturages, and the like.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For removing discontentments, or at least the



<P>danger of them; there is in every state (as we



<P>know) two portions of subjects; the noblesse and



<P>the commonalty.&nbsp; When one of these is discontent,



<P>the danger is not great; for common people are of



<P>slow motion, if they be not excited by the greater



<P>sort; and the greater sort are of small strength,



<P>except the multitude be apt, and ready to move of



<P>themselves.&nbsp; Then is the danger, when the greater



<P>sort, do but wait for the troubling of the waters



<P>amongst the meaner, that then they may declare



<P>themselves.&nbsp; The poets feign, that the rest of the



<P>gods would have bound Jupiter; which he hearing



<P>of, by the counsel of Pallas, sent for Briareus, with



<P>his hundred hands, to come in to his aid.&nbsp; An em-



<P>blem, no doubt, to show how safe it is for mon-



<P>archs, to make sure of the good will of common



<P>people.&nbsp; To give moderate liberty for griefs and dis-



<P>contentments to evaporate (so it be without too



<P>great insolency or bravery), is a safe way.&nbsp; For he



<P>that turneth the humors back, and maketh the



<P>wound bleed inwards, endangereth malign ulcers,



<P>and pernicious imposthumations.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The part of Epimetheus mought well become



<P>Prometheus, in the case of discontentments: for



<P>there is not a better provision against them.&nbsp; Epime-



<P>theus, when griefs and evils flew abroad, at last



<P>shut the lid, and kept hope in the bottom of the



<P>vessel.&nbsp; Certainly, the politic and artificial nourish-



<P>ing, and entertaining of hopes, and carrying men



<P>from hopes to hopes, is one of the best antidotes



<P>against the poison of discontentments.&nbsp; And it is a



<P>certain sign of a wise government and proceeding,



<P>when it can hold men's hearts by hopes, when it



<P>cannot by satisfaction; and when it can handle



<P>things, in such manner, as no evil shall appear so



<P>peremptory, but that it hath some outlet of hope;



<P>which is the less hard to do, because both particu-



<P>lar persons and factions, are apt enough to flatter



<P>themselves, or at least to brave that, which they



<P>believe not.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Also the foresight and prevention, that there be



<P>no likely or fit head, whereunto discontented per-



<P>sons may resort, and under whom they may join,



<P>is a known, but an excellent point of caution.&nbsp; I



<P>understand a fit head, to be one that hath great-



<P>ness and reputation; that hath confidence with



<P>the discontented party, and upon whom they turn



<P>their eyes; and that is thought discontented, in his



<P>own particular: which kind of persons, are either



<P>to be won, and reconciled to the state, and that in



<P>a fast and true manner; or to be fronted with some



<P>other, of the same party, that may oppose them,



<P>and so divide the reputation.&nbsp; Generally, the divid-



<P>ing and breaking, of all factions and combinations



<P>that are adverse to the state, and setting them at



<P>distance, or at least distrust, amongst themselves,



<P>is not one of the worst remedies.&nbsp; For it is a desper-



<P>ate case, if those that hold with the proceeding of



<P>the state, be full of discord and faction, and those



<P>that are against it, be entire and united.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>I have noted, that some witty and sharp



<P>speeches, which have fallen from princes, have



<P>given fire to seditions.&nbsp; Caesar did himself infinite



<P>hurt in that speech, Sylla nescivit literas, non po-



<P>tuit dictare; for it did utterly cut off that hope,



<P>which men had entertained, that he would at one



<P>time or other give over his dictatorship.&nbsp; Galba un-



<P>did himself by that speech, legi a se militem, non



<P>emi; for it put the soldiers out of hope of the dona-



<P>tive.&nbsp; Probus likewise, by that speech, Si vixero,



<P>non opus erit amplius Romano imperio militibus;



<P>a speech of great despair for the soldiers.&nbsp; And



<P>many the like.&nbsp; Surely princes had need, in tender



<P>matters and ticklish times, to beware what they



<P>say; especially in these short speeches, which fly



<P>abroad like darts, and are thought to be shot out of



<P>their secret intentions.&nbsp; For as for large&nbsp; discourses,



<P>they are flat things, and not so much noted.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lastly, let princes, against all events, not be



<P>without some great person, one or rather more, of



<P>military valor, near unto them, for the repressing



<P>of seditions in their beginnings.&nbsp; For without that,



<P>there useth to be more trepidation in court upon



<P>the first breaking out of troubles, than were fit.



<P>And the state runneth the danger of that which



<P>Tacitus saith; Atque is habitus animorum fuit, ut



<P>pessimum facinus auderent pauci, plures vellent,



<P>omnes paterentur.&nbsp; But let such military persons be



<P>assured, and well reputed of, rather than factious



<P>and popular; holding also good correspondence



<P>with the other great men in the state; or else the



<P>remedy, is worse than the disease.
