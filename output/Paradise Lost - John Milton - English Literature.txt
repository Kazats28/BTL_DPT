<BLOCKQUOTE>Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit

<BR>Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast

<BR>Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,

<BR>With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man

<BR>Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,

<BR>Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top

<BR>Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire

<BR>That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,

<BR>In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth

<BR>Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill

<BR>Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd

<BR>Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence

<BR>Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,

<BR>That with no middle flight intends to soar

<BR>Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues

<BR>Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.

<BR>And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer

<BR>Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,

<BR>Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first

<BR>Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread

<BR>Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss

<BR>And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark

<BR>Illumine, what is low raise and support;

<BR>That to the highth of this great Argument

<BR>I may assert th' Eternal Providence,

<BR>And justifie the wayes of God to men.

<BR>Say first, for Heav'n hides nothing from thy view

<BR>Nor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause

<BR>Mov'd our Grand Parents in that happy State,

<BR>Favour'd of Heav'n so highly, to fall off

<BR>From their Creator, and transgress his Will

<BR>For one restraint, Lords of the World besides?

<BR>Who first seduc'd them to that fowl revolt?

<BR>Th' infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile

<BR>Stird up with Envy and Revenge, deceiv'd

<BR>The Mother of Mankinde, what time his Pride

<BR>Had cast him out from Heav'n, with all his Host

<BR>Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring

<BR>To set himself in Glory above his Peers,

<BR>He trusted to have equal'd the most High,

<BR>If he oppos'd; and with ambitious aim

<BR>Against the Throne and Monarchy of God

<BR>Rais'd impious War in Heav'n and Battel proud

<BR>With vain attempt. Him the Almighty Power

<BR>Hurld headlong flaming from th' Ethereal Skie

<BR>With hideous ruine and combustion down

<BR>To bottomless perdition, there to dwell

<BR>In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire,

<BR>Who durst defie th' Omnipotent to Arms.

<BR>Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night

<BR>To mortal men, he with his horrid crew

<BR>Lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe

<BR>Confounded though immortal: But his doom

<BR>Reserv'd him to more wrath; for now the thought

<BR>Both of lost happiness and lasting pain

<BR>Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes

<BR>That witness'd huge affliction and dismay

<BR>Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate:

<BR>At once as far as Angels kenn he views

<BR>The dismal Situation waste and wilde,

<BR>A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round

<BR>As one great Furnace flam'd, yet from those flames

<BR>No light, but rather darkness visible

<BR>Serv'd only to discover sights of woe,

<BR>Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace

<BR>And rest can never dwell, hope never comes

<BR>That comes to all; but torture without end

<BR>Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed

<BR>With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum'd:

<BR>Such place Eternal Justice had prepar'd

<BR>For those rebellious, here their Prison ordain'd

<BR>In utter darkness, and their portion set

<BR>As far remov'd from God and light of Heav'n

<BR>As from the Center thrice to th' utmost Pole.

<BR>O how unlike the place from whence they fell!

<BR>There the companions of his fall, o'rewhelm'd

<BR>With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,

<BR>He soon discerns, and weltring by his side

<BR>One next himself in power, and next in crime,

<BR>Long after known in PALESTINE, and nam'd

<BR>BEELZEBUB. To whom th' Arch-Enemy,

<BR>And thence in Heav'n call'd Satan, with bold words

<BR>Breaking the horrid silence thus began.

<BR>If thou beest he; But O how fall'n! how chang'd

<BR>From him, who in the happy Realms of Light

<BR>Cloth'd with transcendent brightnes didst outshine

<BR>Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league,

<BR>United thoughts and counsels, equal hope,

<BR>And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize,

<BR>Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd

<BR>In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest

<BR>From what highth fal'n, so much the stronger provd

<BR>He with his Thunder: and till then who knew

<BR>The force of those dire Arms? yet not for those

<BR>Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage

<BR>Can else inflict do I repent or change,

<BR>Though chang'd in outward lustre; that fixt mind

<BR>And high disdain, from sence of injur'd merit,

<BR>That with the mightiest rais'd me to contend,

<BR>And to the fierce contention brought along

<BR>Innumerable force of Spirits arm'd

<BR>That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,

<BR>His utmost power with adverse power oppos'd

<BR>In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav'n,

<BR>And shook his throne. What though the field be lost?

<BR>All is not lost; the unconquerable Will,

<BR>And study of revenge, immortal hate,

<BR>And courage never to submit or yield:

<BR>And what is else not to be overcome?

<BR>That Glory never shall his wrath or might

<BR>Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace

<BR>With suppliant knee, and deifie his power

<BR>Who from the terrour of this Arm so late

<BR>Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed,

<BR>That were an ignominy and shame beneath

<BR>This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods

<BR>And this Empyreal substance cannot fail,

<BR>Since through experience of this great event

<BR>In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc't,

<BR>We may with more successful hope resolve

<BR>To wage by force or guile eternal Warr

<BR>Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe,

<BR>Who now triumphs, and in th' excess of joy

<BR>Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav'n.

<BR>So spake th' Apostate Angel, though in pain,

<BR>Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare:

<BR>And him thus answer'd soon his bold Compeer.

<BR>O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,

<BR>That led th' imbattelld Seraphim to Warr

<BR>Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds

<BR>Fearless, endanger'd Heav'ns perpetual King;

<BR>And put to proof his high Supremacy,

<BR>Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,

<BR>Too well I see and rue the dire event,

<BR>That with sad overthrow and foul defeat

<BR>Hath lost us Heav'n, and all this mighty Host

<BR>In horrible destruction laid thus low,

<BR>As far as Gods and Heav'nly Essences

<BR>Can Perish: for the mind and spirit remains

<BR>Invincible, and vigour soon returns,

<BR>Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state

<BR>Here swallow'd up in endless misery.

<BR>But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now

<BR>Of force believe Almighty, since no less

<BR>Then such could hav orepow'rd such force as ours)

<BR>Have left us this our spirit and strength intire

<BR>Strongly to suffer and support our pains,

<BR>That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,

<BR>Or do him mightier service as his thralls

<BR>By right of Warr, what e're his business be

<BR>Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,

<BR>Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;

<BR>What can it then avail though yet we feel

<BR>Strength undiminisht, or eternal being

<BR>To undergo eternal punishment?

<BR>Whereto with speedy words th' Arch-fiend reply'd.

<BR>Fall'n Cherube, to be weak is miserable

<BR>Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure,

<BR>To do ought good never will be our task,

<BR>But ever to do ill our sole delight,

<BR>As being the contrary to his high will

<BR>Whom we resist. If then his Providence

<BR>Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,

<BR>Our labour must be to pervert that end,

<BR>And out of good still to find means of evil;

<BR>Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps

<BR>Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb

<BR>His inmost counsels from their destind aim.

<BR>But see the angry Victor hath recall'd

<BR>His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit

<BR>Back to the Gates of Heav'n: The Sulphurous Hail

<BR>Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid

<BR>The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice

<BR>Of Heav'n receiv'd us falling, and the Thunder,

<BR>Wing'd with red Lightning and impetuous rage,

<BR>Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now

<BR>To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.

<BR>Let us not slip th' occasion, whether scorn,

<BR>Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.

<BR>Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde,

<BR>The seat of desolation, voyd of light,

<BR>Save what the glimmering of these livid flames

<BR>Casts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend

<BR>From off the tossing of these fiery waves,

<BR>There rest, if any rest can harbour there,

<BR>And reassembling our afflicted Powers,

<BR>Consult how we may henceforth most offend

<BR>Our Enemy, our own loss how repair,

<BR>How overcome this dire Calamity,

<BR>What reinforcement we may gain from Hope,

<BR>If not what resolution from despare.

<BR>Thus Satan talking to his neerest Mate

<BR>With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes

<BR>That sparkling blaz'd, his other Parts besides

<BR>Prone on the Flood, extended long and large

<BR>Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge

<BR>As whom the Fables name of monstrous size,

<BR>TITANIAN, or EARTH-BORN, that warr'd on JOVE,

<BR>BRIARIOS or TYPHON, whom the Den

<BR>By ancient TARSUS held, or that Sea-beast

<BR>LEVIATHAN, which God of all his works

<BR>Created hugest that swim th' Ocean stream:

<BR>Him haply slumbring on the NORWAY foam

<BR>The Pilot of some small night-founder'd Skiff,

<BR>Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,

<BR>With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind

<BR>Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night

<BR>Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:

<BR>So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay

<BR>Chain'd on the burning Lake, nor ever thence

<BR>Had ris'n or heav'd his head, but that the will

<BR>And high permission of all-ruling Heaven

<BR>Left him at large to his own dark designs,

<BR>That with reiterated crimes he might

<BR>Heap on himself damnation, while he sought

<BR>Evil to others, and enrag'd might see

<BR>How all his malice serv'd but to bring forth

<BR>Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn

<BR>On Man by him seduc't, but on himself

<BR>Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour'd.

<BR>Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool

<BR>His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames

<BR>Drivn backward slope their pointing spires, &amp; rowld

<BR>In billows, leave i'th' midst a horrid Vale.

<BR>Then with expanded wings he stears his flight

<BR>Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air

<BR>That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land

<BR>He lights, if it were Land that ever burn'd

<BR>With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;

<BR>And such appear'd in hue, as when the force

<BR>Of subterranean wind transports a Hill

<BR>Torn from PELORUS, or the shatter'd side

<BR>Of thundring AETNA, whose combustible

<BR>And fewel'd entrals thence conceiving Fire,

<BR>Sublim'd with Mineral fury, aid the Winds,

<BR>And leave a singed bottom all involv'd

<BR>With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole

<BR>Of unblest feet. Him followed his next Mate,

<BR>Both glorying to have scap't the STYGIAN flood

<BR>As Gods, and by their own recover'd strength,

<BR>Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.

<BR>Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,

<BR>Said then the lost Arch Angel, this the seat

<BR>That we must change for Heav'n, this mournful gloom

<BR>For that celestial light? Be it so, since hee

<BR>Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid

<BR>What shall be right: fardest from him is best

<BR>Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream

<BR>Above his equals. Farewel happy Fields

<BR>Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail

<BR>Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell

<BR>Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings

<BR>A mind not to be chang'd by Place or Time.

<BR>The mind is its own place, and in it self

<BR>Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav'n.

<BR>What matter where, if I be still the same,

<BR>And what I should be, all but less then hee

<BR>Whom Thunder hath made greater? Here at least

<BR>We shall be free; th' Almighty hath not built

<BR>Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:

<BR>Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce

<BR>To reign is worth ambition though in Hell:

<BR>Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav'n.

<BR>But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,

<BR>Th' associates and copartners of our loss

<BR>Lye thus astonisht on th' oblivious Pool,

<BR>And call them not to share with us their part

<BR>In this unhappy Mansion, or once more

<BR>With rallied Arms to try what may be yet

<BR>Regaind in Heav'n, or what more lost in Hell?

<BR>So SATAN spake, and him BEELZEBUB

<BR>Thus answer'd. Leader of those Armies bright,

<BR>Which but th' Omnipotent none could have foyld,

<BR>If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge

<BR>Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft

<BR>In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge

<BR>Of battel when it rag'd, in all assaults

<BR>Their surest signal, they will soon resume

<BR>New courage and revive, though now they lye

<BR>Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,

<BR>As we erewhile, astounded and amaz'd,

<BR>No wonder, fall'n such a pernicious highth.

<BR>He scarce had ceas't when the superiour Fiend

<BR>Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield

<BR>Ethereal temper, massy, large and round,

<BR>Behind him cast; the broad circumference

<BR>Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb

<BR>Through Optic Glass the TUSCAN Artist views

<BR>At Ev'ning from the top of FESOLE,

<BR>Or in VALDARNO, to descry new Lands,

<BR>Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.

<BR>His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine

<BR>Hewn on NORWEGIAN hills, to be the Mast

<BR>Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand,

<BR>He walkt with to support uneasie steps

<BR>Over the burning Marle, not like those steps

<BR>On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime

<BR>Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;

<BR>Nathless he so endur'd, till on the Beach

<BR>Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call'd

<BR>His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans't

<BR>Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks

<BR>In VALLOMBROSA, where th' ETRURIAN shades

<BR>High overarch't imbowr; or scatterd sedge

<BR>Afloat, when with fierce Winds ORION arm'd

<BR>Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew

<BR>BUSIRIS and his MEMPHIAN Chivalrie,

<BR>VVhile with perfidious hatred they pursu'd

<BR>The Sojourners of GOSHEN, who beheld

<BR>From the safe shore their floating Carkases

<BR>And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown

<BR>Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,

<BR>Under amazement of their hideous change.

<BR>He call'd so loud, that all the hollow Deep

<BR>Of Hell resounded. Princes, Potentates,

<BR>Warriers, the Flowr of Heav'n, once yours, now lost,

<BR>If such astonishment as this can sieze

<BR>Eternal spirits; or have ye chos'n this place

<BR>After the toyl of Battel to repose

<BR>Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find

<BR>To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav'n?

<BR>Or in this abject posture have ye sworn

<BR>To adore the Conquerour? who now beholds

<BR>Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood

<BR>With scatter'd Arms and Ensigns, till anon

<BR>His swift pursuers from Heav'n Gates discern

<BR>Th' advantage, and descending tread us down

<BR>Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts

<BR>Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe.

<BR>Awake, arise, or be for ever fall'n.

<BR>They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung

<BR>Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch

<BR>On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,

<BR>Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.

<BR>Nor did they not perceave the evil plight

<BR>In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;

<BR>Yet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd

<BR>Innumerable. As when the potent Rod

<BR>Of AMRAMS Son in EGYPTS evill day

<BR>Wav'd round the Coast, up call'd a pitchy cloud

<BR>Of LOCUSTS, warping on the Eastern Wind,

<BR>That ore the Realm of impious PHAROAH hung

<BR>Like Night, and darken'd all the Land of NILE:

<BR>So numberless were those bad Angels seen

<BR>Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell

<BR>'Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;

<BR>Till, as a signal giv'n, th' uplifted Spear

<BR>Of their great Sultan waving to direct

<BR>Thir course, in even ballance down they light

<BR>On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;

<BR>A multitude, like which the populous North

<BR>Pour'd never from her frozen loyns, to pass

<BR>RHENE or the DANAW, when her barbarous Sons

<BR>Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread

<BR>Beneath GIBRALTAR to the LYBIAN sands.

<BR>Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band

<BR>The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood

<BR>Their great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms

<BR>Excelling human, Princely Dignities,

<BR>And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones;

<BR>Though of their Names in heav'nly Records now

<BR>Be no memorial, blotted out and ras'd

<BR>By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.

<BR>Nor had they yet among the Sons of EVE

<BR>Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,

<BR>Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,

<BR>By falsities and lyes the greatest part

<BR>Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake

<BR>God their Creator, and th' invisible

<BR>Glory of him, that made them, to transform

<BR>Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn'd

<BR>With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,

<BR>And Devils to adore for Deities:

<BR>Then were they known to men by various Names,

<BR>And various Idols through the Heathen World.

<BR>Say, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last,

<BR>Rous'd from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,

<BR>At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth

<BR>Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,

<BR>While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof?

<BR>The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell

<BR>Roaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix

<BR>Their Seats long after next the Seat of God,

<BR>Their Altars by his Altar, Gods ador'd

<BR>Among the Nations round, and durst abide

<BR>JEHOVAH thundring out of SION, thron'd

<BR>Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac'd

<BR>Within his Sanctuary it self their Shrines,

<BR>Abominations; and with cursed things

<BR>His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan'd,

<BR>And with their darkness durst affront his light.

<BR>First MOLOCH, horrid King besmear'd with blood

<BR>Of human sacrifice, and parents tears,

<BR>Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud

<BR>Their childrens cries unheard, that past through fire

<BR>To his grim Idol. Him the AMMONITE

<BR>Worshipt in RABBA and her watry Plain,

<BR>In ARGOB and in BASAN, to the stream

<BR>Of utmost ARNON. Nor content with such

<BR>Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart

<BR>Of SOLOMON he led by fraud to build

<BR>His Temple right against the Temple of God

<BR>On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove

<BR>The pleasant Vally of HINNOM, TOPHET thence

<BR>And black GEHENNA call'd, the Type of Hell.

<BR>Next CHEMOS, th' obscene dread of MOABS Sons,

<BR>From AROER to NEBO, and the wild

<BR>Of Southmost ABARIM; in HESEBON

<BR>And HERONAIM, SEONS Realm, beyond

<BR>The flowry Dale of SIBMA clad with Vines,

<BR>And ELEALE to th' ASPHALTICK Pool.

<BR>PEOR his other Name, when he entic'd

<BR>ISRAEL in SITTIM on their march from NILE

<BR>To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.

<BR>Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg'd

<BR>Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove

<BR>Of MOLOCH homicide, lust hard by hate;

<BR>Till good JOSIAH drove them thence to Hell.

<BR>With these came they, who from the bordring flood

<BR>Of old EUPHRATES to the Brook that parts

<BR>EGYPT from SYRIAN ground, had general Names

<BR>Of BAALIM and ASHTAROTH, those male,

<BR>These Feminine. For Spirits when they please

<BR>Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft

<BR>And uncompounded is their Essence pure,

<BR>Not ti'd or manacl'd with joynt or limb,

<BR>Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,

<BR>Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose

<BR>Dilated or condens't, bright or obscure,

<BR>Can execute their aerie purposes,

<BR>And works of love or enmity fulfill.

<BR>For those the Race of ISRAEL oft forsook

<BR>Their living strength, and unfrequented left

<BR>His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down

<BR>To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low

<BR>Bow'd down in Battel, sunk before the Spear

<BR>Of despicable foes. With these in troop

<BR>Came ASTORETH, whom the PHOENICIANS call'd

<BR>ASTARTE, Queen of Heav'n, with crescent Horns;

<BR>To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon

<BR>SIDONIAN Virgins paid their Vows and Songs,

<BR>In SION also not unsung, where stood

<BR>Her Temple on th' offensive Mountain, built

<BR>By that uxorious King, whose heart though large,

<BR>Beguil'd by fair Idolatresses, fell

<BR>To Idols foul. THAMMUZ came next behind,

<BR>Whose annual wound in LEBANON allur'd

<BR>The SYRIAN Damsels to lament his fate

<BR>In amorous dittyes all a Summers day,

<BR>While smooth ADONIS from his native Rock

<BR>Ran purple to the Sea, suppos'd with blood

<BR>Of THAMMUZ yearly wounded: the Love-tale

<BR>Infected SIONS daughters with like heat,

<BR>Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch

<BR>EZEKIEL saw, when by the Vision led

<BR>His eye survay'd the dark Idolatries

<BR>Of alienated JUDAH. Next came one

<BR>Who mourn'd in earnest, when the Captive Ark

<BR>Maim'd his brute Image, head and hands lopt off

<BR>In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,

<BR>Where he fell flat, and sham'd his Worshipers:

<BR>DAGON his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man

<BR>And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high

<BR>Rear'd in AZOTUS, dreaded through the Coast

<BR>Of PALESTINE, in GATH and ASCALON,

<BR>And ACCARON and GAZA's frontier bounds.

<BR>Him follow'd RIMMON, whose delightful Seat

<BR>Was fair DAMASCUS, on the fertil Banks

<BR>Of ABBANA and PHARPHAR, lucid streams.

<BR>He also against the house of God was bold:

<BR>A Leper once he lost and gain'd a King,

<BR>AHAZ his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew

<BR>Gods Altar to disparage and displace

<BR>For one of SYRIAN mode, whereon to burn

<BR>His odious offrings, and adore the Gods

<BR>Whom he had vanquisht. After these appear'd

<BR>A crew who under Names of old Renown,

<BR>OSIRIS, ISIS, ORUS and their Train

<BR>With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus'd

<BR>Fanatic EGYPT and her Priests, to seek

<BR>Thir wandring Gods disguis'd in brutish forms

<BR>Rather then human. Nor did ISRAEL scape

<BR>Th' infection when their borrow'd Gold compos'd

<BR>The Calf in OREB: and the Rebel King

<BR>Doubl'd that sin in BETHEL and in DAN,

<BR>Lik'ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,

<BR>JEHOVAH, who in one Night when he pass'd

<BR>From EGYPT marching, equal'd with one stroke

<BR>Both her first born and all her bleating Gods.

<BR>BELIAL came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd

<BR>Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love

<BR>Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood

<BR>Or Altar smoak'd; yet who more oft then hee

<BR>In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest

<BR>Turns Atheist, as did ELY'S Sons, who fill'd

<BR>With lust and violence the house of God.

<BR>In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns

<BR>And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse

<BR>Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,

<BR>And injury and outrage: And when Night

<BR>Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons

<BR>Of BELIAL, flown with insolence and wine.

<BR>Witness the Streets of SODOM, and that night

<BR>In GIBEAH, when hospitable Dores

<BR>Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape.

<BR>These were the prime in order and in might;

<BR>The rest were long to tell, though far renown'd,

<BR>Th' IONIAN Gods, of JAVANS Issue held

<BR>Gods, yet confest later then Heav'n and Earth

<BR>Thir boasted Parents; TITAN Heav'ns first born

<BR>With his enormous brood, and birthright seis'd

<BR>By younger SATURN, he from mightier JOVE

<BR>His own and RHEA'S Son like measure found;

<BR>So JOVE usurping reign'd: these first in CREET

<BR>And IDA known, thence on the Snowy top

<BR>Of cold OLYMPUS rul'd the middle Air

<BR>Thir highest Heav'n; or on the DELPHIAN Cliff,

<BR>Or in DODONA, and through all the bounds

<BR>Of DORIC Land; or who with SATURN old

<BR>Fled over ADRIA to th' HESPERIAN Fields,

<BR>And ore the CELTIC roam'd the utmost Isles.

<BR>All these and more came flocking; but with looks

<BR>Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear'd

<BR>Obscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief

<BR>Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost

<BR>In loss it self; which on his count'nance cast

<BR>Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride

<BR>Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore

<BR>Semblance of worth not substance, gently rais'd

<BR>Their fainted courage, and dispel'd their fears.

<BR>Then strait commands that at the warlike sound

<BR>Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard

<BR>His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim'd

<BR>AZAZEL as his right, a Cherube tall:

<BR>Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld

<BR>Th' Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc't

<BR>Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind

<BR>With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz'd,

<BR>Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while

<BR>Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds:

<BR>At which the universal Host upsent

<BR>A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond

<BR>Frighted the Reign of CHAOS and old Night.

<BR>All in a moment through the gloom were seen

<BR>Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air

<BR>With Orient Colours waving: with them rose

<BR>A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms

<BR>Appear'd, and serried Shields in thick array

<BR>Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move

<BR>In perfect PHALANX to the Dorian mood

<BR>Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais'd

<BR>To highth of noblest temper Hero's old

<BR>Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage

<BR>Deliberate valour breath'd, firm and unmov'd

<BR>With dread of death to flight or foul retreat,

<BR>Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage

<BR>With solemn touches, troubl'd thoughts, and chase

<BR>Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain

<BR>From mortal or immortal minds. Thus they

<BR>Breathing united force with fixed thought

<BR>Mov'd on in silence to soft Pipes that charm'd

<BR>Thir painful steps o're the burnt soyle; and now

<BR>Advanc't in view they stand, a horrid Front

<BR>Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise

<BR>Of Warriers old with order'd Spear and Shield,

<BR>Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief

<BR>Had to impose: He through the armed Files

<BR>Darts his experienc't eye, and soon traverse

<BR>The whole Battalion views, thir order due,

<BR>Thir visages and stature as of Gods,

<BR>Thir number last he summs. And now his heart

<BR>Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength

<BR>Glories: For never since created man,

<BR>Met such imbodied force, as nam'd with these

<BR>Could merit more then that small infantry

<BR>Warr'd on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood

<BR>Of PHLEGRA with th' Heroic Race were joyn'd

<BR>That fought at THEB'S and ILIUM, on each side

<BR>Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds

<BR>In Fable or ROMANCE of UTHERS Son

<BR>Begirt with BRITISH and ARMORIC Knights;

<BR>And all who since, Baptiz'd or Infidel

<BR>Jousted in ASPRAMONT or MONTALBAN,

<BR>DAMASCO, or MAROCCO, or TREBISOND,

<BR>Or whom BISERTA sent from AFRIC shore

<BR>When CHARLEMAIN with all his Peerage fell

<BR>By FONTARABBIA. Thus far these beyond

<BR>Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ'd

<BR>Thir dread Commander: he above the rest

<BR>In shape and gesture proudly eminent

<BR>Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost

<BR>All her Original brightness, nor appear'd

<BR>Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th' excess

<BR>Of Glory obscur'd: As when the Sun new ris'n

<BR>Looks through the Horizontal misty Air

<BR>Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon

<BR>In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds

<BR>On half the Nations, and with fear of change

<BR>Perplexes Monarchs. Dark'n'd so, yet shon

<BR>Above them all th' Arch Angel: but his face

<BR>Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care

<BR>Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes

<BR>Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride

<BR>Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast

<BR>Signs of remorse and passion to behold

<BR>The fellows of his crime, the followers rather

<BR>(Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn'd

<BR>For ever now to have their lot in pain,

<BR>Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc't

<BR>Of Heav'n, and from Eternal Splendors flung

<BR>For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood,

<BR>Thir Glory witherd. As when Heavens Fire

<BR>Hath scath'd the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines,

<BR>With singed top their stately growth though bare

<BR>Stands on the blasted Heath. He now prepar'd

<BR>To speak; whereat their doubl'd Ranks they bend

<BR>From Wing to Wing, and half enclose him round

<BR>With all his Peers: attention held them mute.

<BR>Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spite of scorn,

<BR>Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last

<BR>Words interwove with sighs found out their way.

<BR>O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers

<BR>Matchless, but with th' Almighty, and that strife

<BR>Was not inglorious, though th' event was dire,

<BR>As this place testifies, and this dire change

<BR>Hateful to utter: but what power of mind

<BR>Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth

<BR>Of knowledge past or present, could have fear'd,

<BR>How such united force of Gods, how such

<BR>As stood like these, could ever know repulse?

<BR>For who can yet beleeve, though after loss,

<BR>That all these puissant Legions, whose exile

<BR>Hath emptied Heav'n, shall faile to re-ascend

<BR>Self-rais'd, and repossess their native seat.

<BR>For me, be witness all the Host of Heav'n,

<BR>If counsels different, or danger shun'd

<BR>By me, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns

<BR>Monarch in Heav'n, till then as one secure

<BR>Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute,

<BR>Consent or custome, and his Regal State

<BR>Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal'd,

<BR>Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.

<BR>Henceforth his might we know, and know our own

<BR>So as not either to provoke, or dread

<BR>New warr, provok't; our better part remains

<BR>To work in close design, by fraud or guile

<BR>What force effected not: that he no less

<BR>At length from us may find, who overcomes

<BR>By force, hath overcome but half his foe.

<BR>Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife

<BR>There went a fame in Heav'n that he ere long

<BR>Intended to create, and therein plant

<BR>A generation, whom his choice regard

<BR>Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven:

<BR>Thither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps

<BR>Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere:

<BR>For this Infernal Pit shall never hold

<BR>Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th' Abysse

<BR>Long under darkness cover. But these thoughts

<BR>Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird,

<BR>For who can think Submission? Warr then, Warr

<BR>Open or understood must be resolv'd.

<BR>He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew

<BR>Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs

<BR>Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze

<BR>Far round illumin'd hell: highly they rag'd

<BR>Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm's

<BR>Clash'd on their sounding shields the din of war,

<BR>Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heav'n.

<BR>There stood a Hill not far whose griesly top

<BR>Belch'd fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire

<BR>Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign

<BR>That in his womb was hid metallic Ore,

<BR>The work of Sulphur. Thither wing'd with speed

<BR>A numerous Brigad hasten'd. As when bands

<BR>Of Pioners with Spade and Pickaxe arm'd

<BR>Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,

<BR>Or cast a Rampart. MAMMON led them on,

<BR>MAMMON, the least erected Spirit that fell

<BR>From heav'n, for ev'n in heav'n his looks &amp; thoughts

<BR>Were always downward bent, admiring more

<BR>The riches of Heav'ns pavement, trod'n Gold,

<BR>Then aught divine or holy else enjoy'd

<BR>In vision beatific: by him first

<BR>Men also, and by his suggestion taught,

<BR>Ransack'd the Center, and with impious hands

<BR>Rifl'd the bowels of thir mother Earth

<BR>For Treasures better hid. Soon had his crew

<BR>Op'nd into the Hill a spacious wound

<BR>And dig'd out ribs of Gold. Let none admire

<BR>That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best

<BR>Deserve the pretious bane. And here let those

<BR>Who boast in mortal things, and wondring tell

<BR>Of BABEL, and the works of MEMPHIAN Kings,

<BR>Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame,

<BR>And Strength and Art are easily outdone

<BR>By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour

<BR>What in an age they with incessant toyle

<BR>And hands innumerable scarce perform

<BR>Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar'd,

<BR>That underneath had veins of liquid fire

<BR>Sluc'd from the Lake, a second multitude

<BR>With wondrous Art founded the massie Ore,

<BR>Severing each kinde, and scum'd the Bullion dross:

<BR>A third as soon had form'd within the ground

<BR>A various mould, and from the boyling cells

<BR>By strange conveyance fill'd each hollow nook,

<BR>As in an Organ from one blast of wind

<BR>To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths.

<BR>Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge

<BR>Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound

<BR>Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet,

<BR>Built like a Temple, where PILASTERS round

<BR>Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid

<BR>With Golden Architrave; nor did there want

<BR>Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav'n,

<BR>The Roof was fretted Gold. Not BABILON,

<BR>Nor great ALCAIRO such magnificence

<BR>Equal'd in all thir glories, to inshrine

<BR>BELUS or SERAPIS thir Gods, or seat

<BR>Thir Kings, when AEGYPT with ASSYRIA strove

<BR>In wealth and luxurie. Th' ascending pile

<BR>Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores

<BR>Op'ning thir brazen foulds discover wide

<BR>Within, her ample spaces, o're the smooth

<BR>And level pavement: from the arched roof

<BR>Pendant by suttle Magic many a row

<BR>Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed

<BR>With Naphtha and ASPHALTUS yeilded light

<BR>As from a sky. The hasty multitude

<BR>Admiring enter'd, and the work some praise

<BR>And some the Architect: his hand was known

<BR>In Heav'n by many a Towred structure high,

<BR>Where Scepter'd Angels held thir residence,

<BR>And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King

<BR>Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,

<BR>Each in his Herarchie, the Orders bright.

<BR>Nor was his name unheard or unador'd

<BR>In ancient Greece; and in AUSONIAN land

<BR>Men call'd him MULCIBER; and how he fell

<BR>From Heav'n, they fabl'd, thrown by angry JOVE

<BR>Sheer o're the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn

<BR>To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,

<BR>A Summers day; and with the setting Sun

<BR>Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star,

<BR>On LEMNOS th' AEGAEAN Ile: thus they relate,

<BR>Erring; for he with this rebellious rout

<BR>Fell long before; nor aught avail'd him now

<BR>To have built in Heav'n high Towrs; nor did he scape

<BR>By all his Engins, but was headlong sent

<BR>With his industrious crew to build in hell.

<BR>Mean while the winged Haralds by command

<BR>Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony

<BR>And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim

<BR>A solemn Councel forthwith to be held

<BR>At PANDAEMONIUM, the high Capital

<BR>Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call'd

<BR>From every and Band squared Regiment

<BR>By place or choice the worthiest; they anon

<BR>With hundreds and with thousands trooping came

<BR>Attended: all access was throng'd, the Gates

<BR>And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall

<BR>(Though like a cover'd field, where Champions bold

<BR>Wont ride in arm'd, and at the Soldans chair

<BR>Defi'd the best of Panim chivalry

<BR>To mortal combat or carreer with Lance)

<BR>Thick swarm'd, both on the ground and in the air,

<BR>Brusht with the hiss of russling wings. As Bees

<BR>In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides,

<BR>Poure forth thir populous youth about the Hive

<BR>In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers

<BR>Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank,

<BR>The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel,

<BR>New rub'd with Baume, expatiate and confer

<BR>Thir State affairs. So thick the aerie crowd

<BR>Swarm'd and were straitn'd; till the Signal giv'n,

<BR>Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd

<BR>In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons

<BR>Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room

<BR>Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race

<BR>Beyond the INDIAN Mount, or Faerie Elves,

<BR>Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side

<BR>Or Fountain fome belated Peasant sees,

<BR>Or dreams he sees, while over head the Moon

<BR>Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth

<BR>Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth &amp; dance

<BR>Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear;

<BR>At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.

<BR>Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms

<BR>Reduc'd thir shapes immense, and were at large,

<BR>Though without number still amidst the Hall

<BR>Of that infernal Court. But far within

<BR>And in thir own dimensions like themselves

<BR>The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim

<BR>In close recess and secret conclave sat

<BR>A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat's,

<BR>Frequent and full. After short silence then

<BR>And summons read, the great consult began.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Thus they in lowliest plight repentant stood

<BR>Praying, for from the Mercie-seat above

<BR>Prevenient Grace descending had remov'd

<BR>The stonie from thir hearts, and made new flesh

<BR>Regenerat grow instead, that sighs now breath'd

<BR>Unutterable, which the Spirit of prayer

<BR>Inspir'd, and wing'd for Heav'n with speedier flight

<BR>Then loudest Oratorie: yet thir port

<BR>Not of mean suiters, nor important less

<BR>Seem'd thir Petition, then when th' ancient Pair

<BR>In Fables old, less ancient yet then these,

<BR>DEUCALION and chaste PYRRHA to restore

<BR>The Race of Mankind drownd, before the Shrine

<BR>Of THEMIS stood devout. To Heav'n thir prayers

<BR>Flew up, nor missed the way, by envious windes

<BR>Blow'n vagabond or frustrate: in they passd

<BR>Dimentionless through Heav'nly dores; then clad

<BR>With incense, where the Golden Altar fum'd,

<BR>By thir great Intercessor, came in sight

<BR>Before the Fathers Throne: Them the glad Son

<BR>Presenting, thus to intercede began.

<BR>See Father, what first fruits on Earth are sprung

<BR>From thy implanted Grace in Man, these Sighs

<BR>And Prayers, which in this Golden Censer, mixt

<BR>With Incense, I thy Priest before thee bring,

<BR>Fruits of more pleasing savour from thy seed

<BR>Sow'n with contrition in his heart, then those

<BR>Which his own hand manuring all the Trees

<BR>Of Paradise could have produc't, ere fall'n

<BR>From innocence. Now therefore bend thine eare

<BR>To supplication, heare his sighs though mute;

<BR>Unskilful with what words to pray, let mee

<BR>Interpret for him, mee his Advocate

<BR>And propitiation, all his works on mee

<BR>Good or not good ingraft, my Merit those

<BR>Shall perfet, and for these my Death shall pay.

<BR>Accept me, and in mee from these receave

<BR>The smell of peace toward Mankinde, let him live

<BR>Before thee reconcil'd, at least his days

<BR>Numberd, though sad, till Death, his doom (which I

<BR>To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse)

<BR>To better life shall yeeld him, where with mee

<BR>All my redeemd may dwell in joy and bliss,

<BR>Made one with me as I with thee am one.

<BR>To whom the Father, without Cloud, serene.

<BR>All thy request for Man, accepted Son,

<BR>Obtain, all thy request was my Decree:

<BR>But longer in that Paradise to dwell,

<BR>The Law I gave to Nature him forbids:

<BR>Those pure immortal Elements that know

<BR>No gross, no unharmoneous mixture foule,

<BR>Eject him tainted now, and purge him off

<BR>As a distemper, gross to aire as gross,

<BR>And mortal food, as may dispose him best

<BR>For dissolution wrought by Sin, that first

<BR>Distemperd all things, and of incorrupt

<BR>Corrupted. I at first with two fair gifts

<BR>Created him endowd, with Happiness

<BR>And Immortalitie: that fondly lost,

<BR>This other serv'd but to eternize woe;

<BR>Till I provided Death; so Death becomes

<BR>His final remedie, and after Life

<BR>Tri'd in sharp tribulation, and refin'd

<BR>By Faith and faithful works, to second Life,

<BR>Wak't in the renovation of the just,

<BR>Resignes him up with Heav'n and Earth renewd.

<BR>But let us call to Synod all the Blest

<BR>Through Heav'ns wide bounds; from them I will not hide

<BR>My judgments, how with Mankind I proceed,

<BR>As how with peccant Angels late they saw;

<BR>And in thir state, though firm, stood more confirmd.

<BR>He ended, and the Son gave signal high

<BR>To the bright Minister that watchd, hee blew

<BR>His Trumpet, heard in OREB since perhaps

<BR>When God descended, and perhaps once more

<BR>To sound at general Doom. Th' Angelic blast

<BR>Filld all the Regions: from thir blissful Bowrs

<BR>Of AMARANTIN Shade, Fountain or Spring,

<BR>By the waters of Life, where ere they sate

<BR>In fellowships of joy: the Sons of Light

<BR>Hasted, resorting to the Summons high,

<BR>And took thir Seats; till from his Throne supream

<BR>Th' Almighty thus pronounced his sovran Will.

<BR>O Sons, like one of us Man is become

<BR>To know both Good and Evil, since his taste

<BR>Of that defended Fruit; but let him boast

<BR>His knowledge of Good lost, and Evil got,

<BR>Happier, had it suffic'd him to have known

<BR>Good by it self, and Evil not at all.

<BR>He sorrows now, repents, and prayes contrite,

<BR>My motions in him, longer then they move,

<BR>His heart I know, how variable and vain

<BR>Self-left. Least therefore his now bolder hand

<BR>Reach also of the Tree of Life, and eat,

<BR>And live for ever, dream at least to live

<BR>Forever, to remove him I decree,

<BR>And send him from the Garden forth to Till

<BR>The Ground whence he was taken, fitter soile.

<BR>MICHAEL, this my behest have thou in charge,

<BR>Take to thee from among the Cherubim

<BR>Thy choice of flaming Warriours, least the Fiend

<BR>Or in behalf of Man, or to invade

<BR>Vacant possession som new trouble raise:

<BR>Hast thee, and from the Paradise of God

<BR>Without remorse drive out the sinful Pair,

<BR>From hallowd ground th' unholie, and denounce

<BR>To them and to thir Progenie from thence

<BR>Perpetual banishment. Yet least they faint

<BR>At the sad Sentence rigorously urg'd,

<BR>For I behold them soft'nd and with tears

<BR>Bewailing thir excess, all terror hide.

<BR>If patiently thy bidding they obey,

<BR>Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveale

<BR>To ADAM what shall come in future dayes,

<BR>As I shall thee enlighten, intermix

<BR>My Cov'nant in the Womans seed renewd;

<BR>So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace:

<BR>And on the East side of the Garden place,

<BR>Where entrance up from EDEN easiest climbes,

<BR>Cherubic watch, and of a Sword the flame

<BR>Wide waving, all approach farr off to fright,

<BR>And guard all passage to the Tree of Life:

<BR>Least Paradise a receptacle prove

<BR>To Spirits foule, and all my Trees thir prey,

<BR>With whose stol'n Fruit Man once more to delude.

<BR>He ceas'd; and th' Archangelic Power prepar'd

<BR>For swift descent, with him the Cohort bright

<BR>Of watchful Cherubim; four faces each

<BR>Had, like a double JANUS, all thir shape

<BR>Spangl'd with eyes more numerous then those

<BR>Of ARGUS, and more wakeful then to drouze,

<BR>Charm'd with ARCADIAN Pipe, the Pastoral Reed

<BR>Of HERMES, or his opiate Rod. Meanwhile

<BR>To resalute the World with sacred Light

<BR>LEUCOTHEA wak'd, and with fresh dews imbalmd

<BR>The Earth, when ADAM and first Matron EVE

<BR>Had ended now thir Orisons, and found,

<BR>Strength added from above, new hope to spring

<BR>Out of despaire, joy, but with fear yet linkt;

<BR>Which thus to EVE his welcome words renewd.

<BR>EVE, easily may Faith admit, that all

<BR>The good which we enjoy, from Heav'n descends

<BR>But that from us ought should ascend to Heav'n

<BR>So prevalent as to concerne the mind

<BR>Of God high blest, or to incline his will,

<BR>Hard to belief may seem; yet this will Prayer,

<BR>Or one short sigh of humane breath, up-borne

<BR>Ev'n to the Seat of God. For since I saught

<BR>By Prayer th' offended Deitie to appease,

<BR>Kneel'd and before him humbl'd all my heart,

<BR>Methought I saw him placable and mild,

<BR>Bending his eare; perswasion in me grew

<BR>That I was heard with favour; peace returnd

<BR>Home to my brest, and to my memorie

<BR>His promise, that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe;

<BR>Which then not minded in dismay, yet now

<BR>Assures me that the bitterness of death

<BR>Is past, and we shall live. Whence Haile to thee,

<BR>EVE rightly call'd, Mother of all Mankind,

<BR>Mother of all things living, since by thee

<BR>Man is to live, and all things live for Man.

<BR>To whom thus EVE with sad demeanour meek.

<BR>Ill worthie I such title should belong

<BR>To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind

<BR>A help, became thy snare; to mee reproach

<BR>Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise:

<BR>But infinite in pardon was my Judge,

<BR>That I who first brought Death on all, am grac't

<BR>The sourse of life; next favourable thou,

<BR>Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf't,

<BR>Farr other name deserving. But the Field

<BR>To labour calls us now with sweat impos'd,

<BR>Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn,

<BR>All unconcern'd with our unrest, begins

<BR>Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth,

<BR>I never from thy side henceforth to stray,

<BR>Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind

<BR>Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell,

<BR>What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes?

<BR>Here let us live, though in fall'n state, content.

<BR>So spake, so wish'd much-humbl'd EVE, but Fate

<BR>Subscrib'd not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest

<BR>On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips'd

<BR>After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight

<BR>The Bird of JOVE, stoopt from his aerie tour,

<BR>Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove:

<BR>Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods,

<BR>First Hunter then, pursu'd a gentle brace,

<BR>Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde;

<BR>Direct to th' Eastern Gate was bent thir flight.

<BR>ADAM observ'd, and with his Eye the chase

<BR>Pursuing, not unmov'd to EVE thus spake.

<BR>O EVE, some furder change awaits us nigh,

<BR>Which Heav'n by these mute signs in Nature shews

<BR>Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn

<BR>Us haply too secure of our discharge

<BR>From penaltie, because from death releast

<BR>Some days; how long, and what till then our life,

<BR>Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust,

<BR>And thither must return and be no more.

<BR>VVhy else this double object in our sight

<BR>Of flight pursu'd in th' Air and ore the ground

<BR>One way the self-same hour? why in the East

<BR>Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light

<BR>More orient in yon VVestern Cloud that draws

<BR>O're the blew Firmament a radiant white,

<BR>And slow descends, with somthing heav'nly fraught.

<BR>He err'd not, for by this the heav'nly Bands

<BR>Down from a Skie of Jasper lighted now

<BR>In Paradise, and on a Hill made alt,

<BR>A glorious Apparition, had not doubt

<BR>And carnal fear that day dimm'd ADAMS eye.

<BR>Not that more glorious, when the Angels met

<BR>JACOB in MAHANAIM, where he saw

<BR>The field Pavilion'd with his Guardians bright;

<BR>Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd

<BR>In DOTHAN, cover'd with a Camp of Fire,

<BR>Against the SYRIAN King, who to surprize

<BR>One man, Assassin-like had levied Warr,

<BR>Warr unproclam'd. The Princely Hierarch

<BR>In thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seise

<BR>Possession of the Garden; hee alone,

<BR>To finde where ADAM shelterd, took his way,

<BR>Not unperceav'd of ADAM, who to EVE,

<BR>While the great Visitant approachd, thus spake.

<BR>EVE, now expect great tidings, which perhaps

<BR>Of us will soon determin, or impose

<BR>New Laws to be observ'd; for I descrie

<BR>From yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill

<BR>One of the heav'nly Host, and by his Gate

<BR>None of the meanest, some great Potentate

<BR>Or of the Thrones above, such Majestie

<BR>Invests him coming; yet not terrible,

<BR>That I should fear, nor sociably mild,

<BR>As RAPHAEL, that I should much confide,

<BR>But solemn and sublime, whom not to offend,

<BR>With reverence I must meet, and thou retire.

<BR>He ended; and th' Arch-Angel soon drew nigh,

<BR>Not in his shape Celestial, but as Man

<BR>Clad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes

<BR>A militarie Vest of purple flowd

<BR>Livelier then MELIBOEAN, or the graine

<BR>Of SARRA, worn by Kings and Hero's old

<BR>In time of Truce; IRIS had dipt the wooff;

<BR>His starrie Helme unbuckl'd shew'd him prime

<BR>In Manhood where Youth ended; by his side

<BR>As in a glistering ZODIAC hung the Sword,

<BR>Satans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear.

<BR>ADAM bowd low, hee Kingly from his State

<BR>Inclin'd not, but his coming thus declar'd.

<BR>ADAM, Heav'ns high behest no Preface needs:

<BR>Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death,

<BR>Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress,

<BR>Defeated of his seisure many dayes

<BR>Giv'n thee of Grace, wherein thou may'st repent,

<BR>And one bad act with many deeds well done

<BR>Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas'd

<BR>Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claimes;

<BR>But longer in this Paradise to dwell

<BR>Permits not; to remove thee I am come,

<BR>And send thee from the Garden forth to till

<BR>The ground whence thou wast tak'n, fitter Soile.

<BR>He added not, for ADAM at the newes

<BR>Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood,

<BR>That all his senses bound; EVE, who unseen

<BR>Yet all had heard, with audible lament

<BR>Discover'd soon the place of her retire.

<BR>O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death!

<BR>Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave

<BR>Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades,

<BR>Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend,

<BR>Quiet though sad, the respit of that day

<BR>That must be mortal to us both. O flours,

<BR>That never will in other Climate grow,

<BR>My early visitation, and my last

<BR>At Eev'n, which I bred up with tender hand

<BR>From the first op'ning bud, and gave ye Names,

<BR>Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke

<BR>Your Tribes, and water from th' ambrosial Fount?

<BR>Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd

<BR>With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee

<BR>How shall I part, and whither wander down

<BR>Into a lower World, to this obscure

<BR>And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire

<BR>Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits?

<BR>Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde.

<BR>Lament not EVE, but patiently resigne

<BR>What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart,

<BR>Thus over fond, on that which is not thine;

<BR>Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes

<BR>Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound;

<BR>Where he abides, think there thy native soile.

<BR>ADAM by this from the cold sudden damp

<BR>Recovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd,

<BR>To MICHAEL thus his humble words addressd.

<BR>Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or nam'd

<BR>Of them the Highest, for such of shape may seem

<BR>Prince above Princes, gently hast thou tould

<BR>Thy message, which might else in telling wound,

<BR>And in performing end us; what besides

<BR>Of sorrow and dejection and despair

<BR>Our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring,

<BR>Departure from this happy place, our sweet

<BR>Recess, and onely consolation left

<BR>Familiar to our eyes, all places else

<BR>Inhospitable appeer and desolate,

<BR>Nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer

<BR>Incessant I could hope to change the will

<BR>Of him who all things can, I would not cease

<BR>To wearie him with my assiduous cries:

<BR>But prayer against his absolute Decree

<BR>No more availes then breath against the winde,

<BR>Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth:

<BR>Therefore to his great bidding I submit.

<BR>This most afflicts me, that departing hence,

<BR>As from his face I shall be hid, deprivd

<BR>His blessed count'nance; here I could frequent,

<BR>With worship, place by place where he voutsaf'd

<BR>Presence Divine, and to my Sons relate;

<BR>On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree

<BR>Stood visible, among these Pines his voice

<BR>I heard, here with him at this Fountain talk'd:

<BR>So many grateful Altars I would reare

<BR>Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone

<BR>Of lustre from the brook, in memorie,

<BR>Or monument to Ages, and thereon

<BR>Offer sweet smelling Gumms &amp; Fruits and Flours:

<BR>In yonder nether World where shall I seek

<BR>His bright appearances, or footstep trace?

<BR>For though I fled him angrie, yet recall'd

<BR>To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now

<BR>Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts

<BR>Of glory, and farr off his steps adore.

<BR>To whom thus MICHAEL with regard benigne.

<BR>ADAM, thou know'st Heav'n his, and all the Earth

<BR>Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills

<BR>Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives,

<BR>Fomented by his virtual power and warmd:

<BR>All th' Earth he gave thee to possess and rule,

<BR>No despicable gift; surmise not then

<BR>His presence to these narrow bounds confin'd

<BR>Of Paradise or EDEN: this had been

<BR>Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred

<BR>All generations, and had hither come

<BR>From all the ends of th' Earth, to celebrate

<BR>And reverence thee thir great Progenitor.

<BR>But this praeeminence thou hast lost, brought down

<BR>To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons:

<BR>Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in Plaine

<BR>God is as here, and will be found alike

<BR>Present, and of his presence many a signe

<BR>Still following thee, still compassing thee round

<BR>With goodness and paternal Love, his Face

<BR>Express, and of his steps the track Divine.

<BR>Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd,

<BR>Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent

<BR>To shew thee what shall come in future dayes

<BR>To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad

<BR>Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending

<BR>With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn

<BR>True patience, and to temper joy with fear

<BR>And pious sorrow, equally enur'd

<BR>By moderation either state to beare,

<BR>Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead

<BR>Safest thy life, and best prepar'd endure

<BR>Thy mortal passage when it comes. Ascend

<BR>This Hill; let EVE (for I have drencht her eyes)

<BR>Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak'st,

<BR>As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd.

<BR>To whom thus ADAM gratefully repli'd.

<BR>Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path

<BR>Thou lead'st me, and to the hand of Heav'n submit,

<BR>However chast'ning, to the evil turne

<BR>My obvious breast, arming to overcom

<BR>By suffering, and earne rest from labour won,

<BR>If so I may attain. So both ascend

<BR>In the Visions of God: It was a Hill

<BR>Of Paradise the highest, from whose top

<BR>The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken

<BR>Stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay.

<BR>Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round,

<BR>Whereon for different cause the Tempter set

<BR>Our second ADAM in the Wilderness,

<BR>To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory.

<BR>His Eye might there command wherever stood

<BR>City of old or modern Fame, the Seat

<BR>Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls

<BR>Of CAMBALU, seat of CATHAIAN CAN

<BR>And SAMARCHAND by OXUS, TEMIRS Throne,

<BR>To PAQUIN of SINAEAN Kings, and thence

<BR>To AGRA and LAHOR of great MOGUL

<BR>Down to the golden CHERSONESE, or where

<BR>The PERSIAN in ECBATAN sate, or since

<BR>In HISPAHAN, or where the RUSSIAN KSAR

<BR>In MOSCO, or the Sultan in BIZANCE,

<BR>TURCHESTAN-born; nor could his eye not ken

<BR>Th' Empire of NEGUS to his utmost Port

<BR>ERCOCO and the less Maritine Kings

<BR>MOMBAZA, and QUILOA, and MELIND,

<BR>And SOFALA thought OPHIR, to the Realme

<BR>Of CONGO, and ANGOLA fardest South;

<BR>Or thence from NIGER Flood to ATLAS Mount

<BR>The Kingdoms of ALMANSOR, FEZ, and SUS,

<BR>MAROCCO and ALGIERS, and TREMISEN;

<BR>On EUROPE thence, and where ROME was to sway

<BR>The VVorld: in Spirit perhaps he also saw

<BR>Rich MEXICO the seat of MOTEZUME,

<BR>And CUSCO in PERU, the richer seat

<BR>Of ATABALIPA, and yet unspoil'd

<BR>GUIANA, whose great Citie GERYONS Sons

<BR>Call EL DORADO: but to nobler sights

<BR>MICHAEL from ADAMS eyes the Filme remov'd

<BR>VVhich that false Fruit that promis'd clearer sight

<BR>Had bred; then purg'd with Euphrasie and Rue

<BR>The visual Nerve, for he had much to see;

<BR>And from the VVell of Life three drops instill'd.

<BR>So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc'd,

<BR>Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight,

<BR>That ADAM now enforc't to close his eyes,

<BR>Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst:

<BR>But him the gentle Angel by the hand

<BR>Soon rais'd, and his attention thus recall'd.

<BR>ADAM, now ope thine eyes, and first behold

<BR>Th' effects which thy original crime hath wrought

<BR>In some to spring from thee, who never touch'd

<BR>Th' excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspir'd,

<BR>Nor sinn'd thy sin, yet from that sin derive

<BR>Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds.

<BR>His eyes he op'nd, and beheld a field,

<BR>Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves

<BR>New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds;

<BR>Ith' midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood

<BR>Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon

<BR>A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought

<BR>First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf,

<BR>Uncull'd, as came to hand; a Shepherd next

<BR>More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock

<BR>Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid

<BR>The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew'd,

<BR>On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform'd.

<BR>His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav'n

<BR>Consum'd with nimble glance, and grateful steame;

<BR>The others not, for his was not sincere;

<BR>Whereat hee inlie rag'd, and as they talk'd,

<BR>Smote him into the Midriff with a stone

<BR>That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale

<BR>Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus'd.

<BR>Much at that sight was ADAM in his heart

<BR>Dismai'd, and thus in haste to th' Angel cri'd.

<BR>O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall'n

<BR>To that meek man, who well had sacrific'd;

<BR>Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid?

<BR>T' whom MICHAEL thus, hee also mov'd, repli'd.

<BR>These two are Brethren, ADAM, and to come

<BR>Out of thy loyns; th' unjust the just hath slain,

<BR>For envie that his Brothers Offering found

<BR>From Heav'n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact

<BR>Will be aveng'd, and th' others Faith approv'd

<BR>Loose no reward, though here thou see him die,

<BR>Rowling in dust and gore. To which our Sire.

<BR>Alas, both for the deed and for the cause!

<BR>But have I now seen Death? Is this the way

<BR>I must return to native dust? O sight

<BR>Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold,

<BR>Horrid to think, how horrible to feel!

<BR>To whom thus MICHAEL. Death thou hast seen

<BR>In his first shape on man; but many shapes

<BR>Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead

<BR>To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense

<BR>More terrible at th' entrance then within.

<BR>Some, as thou saw'st, by violent stroke shall die,

<BR>By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more

<BR>In Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shal bring

<BR>Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew

<BR>Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know

<BR>What miserie th' inabstinence of EVE

<BR>Shall bring on men. Immediately a place

<BR>Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark,

<BR>A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid

<BR>Numbers of all diseas'd, all maladies

<BR>Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes

<BR>Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds,

<BR>Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs,

<BR>Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs,

<BR>Dropsies, and Asthma's, and Joint-racking Rheums.

<BR>Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair

<BR>Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch;

<BR>And over them triumphant Death his Dart

<BR>Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok't

<BR>With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope.

<BR>Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long

<BR>Drie-ey'd behold? ADAM could not, but wept,

<BR>Though not of Woman born; compassion quell'd

<BR>His best of Man, and gave him up to tears

<BR>A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess,

<BR>And scarce recovering words his plaint renew'd.

<BR>O miserable Mankind, to what fall

<BR>Degraded, to what wretched state reserv'd?

<BR>Better end heer unborn. Why is life giv'n

<BR>To be thus wrested from us? rather why

<BR>Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew

<BR>What we receive, would either not accept

<BR>Life offer'd, or soon beg to lay it down,

<BR>Glad to be so dismist in peace. Can thus

<BR>Th' Image of God in man created once

<BR>So goodly and erect, though faultie since,

<BR>To such unsightly sufferings be debas't

<BR>Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man,

<BR>Retaining still Divine similitude

<BR>In part, from such deformities be free,

<BR>And for his Makers Image sake exempt?

<BR>Thir Makers Image, answerd MICHAEL, then

<BR>Forsook them, when themselves they villifi'd

<BR>To serve ungovern'd appetite, and took

<BR>His Image whom they serv'd, a brutish vice,

<BR>Inductive mainly to the sin of EVE.

<BR>Therefore so abject is thir punishment,

<BR>Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own,

<BR>Or if his likeness, by themselves defac't

<BR>While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules

<BR>To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they

<BR>Gods Image did not reverence in themselves.

<BR>I yeild it just, said ADAM, and submit.

<BR>But is there yet no other way, besides

<BR>These painful passages, how we may come

<BR>To Death, and mix with our connatural dust?

<BR>There is, said MICHAEL, if thou well observe

<BR>The rule of not too much, by temperance taught

<BR>In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence

<BR>Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight,

<BR>Till many years over thy head return:

<BR>So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop

<BR>Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease

<BR>Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature:

<BR>This is old age; but then thou must outlive

<BR>Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change

<BR>To witherd weak &amp; gray; thy Senses then

<BR>Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe,

<BR>To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth

<BR>Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne

<BR>A melancholly damp of cold and dry

<BR>To waigh thy spirits down, and last consume

<BR>The Balme of Life. To whom our Ancestor.

<BR>Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong

<BR>Life much, bent rather how I may be quit

<BR>Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge,

<BR>Which I must keep till my appointed day

<BR>Of rendring up. MICHAEL to him repli'd.

<BR>Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst

<BR>Live well, how long or short permit to Heav'n:

<BR>And now prepare thee for another sight.

<BR>He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon

<BR>Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds

<BR>Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound

<BR>Of Instruments that made melodious chime

<BR>Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd

<BR>Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch

<BR>Instinct through all proportions low and high

<BR>Fled and pursu'd transverse the resonant fugue.

<BR>In other part stood one who at the Forge

<BR>Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass

<BR>Had melted (whether found where casual fire

<BR>Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale,

<BR>Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot

<BR>To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream

<BR>From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind

<BR>Into fit moulds prepar'd; from which he formd

<BR>First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought

<BR>Fulfil or grav'n in mettle. After these,

<BR>But on the hether side a different sort

<BR>From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat,

<BR>Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise

<BR>Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent

<BR>To worship God aright, and know his works

<BR>Not hid, nor those things lost which might preserve

<BR>Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain

<BR>Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold

<BR>A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay

<BR>In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung

<BR>Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on:

<BR>The Men though grave, ey'd them, and let thir eyes

<BR>Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net

<BR>Fast caught, they lik'd, and each his liking chose;

<BR>And now of love they treat till th' Eevning Star

<BR>Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat

<BR>They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke

<BR>Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok't;

<BR>With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound.

<BR>Such happy interview and fair event

<BR>Of love &amp; youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours,

<BR>And charming Symphonies attach'd the heart

<BR>Of ADAM, soon enclin'd to admit delight,

<BR>The bent of Nature; which he thus express'd.

<BR>True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest,

<BR>Much better seems this Vision, and more hope

<BR>Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past;

<BR>Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse,

<BR>Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends.

<BR>To whom thus MICHAEL. Judg not what is best

<BR>By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet,

<BR>Created, as thou art, to nobler end

<BR>Holie and pure, conformitie divine.

<BR>Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents

<BR>Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race

<BR>Who slew his Brother; studious they appere

<BR>Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare,

<BR>Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit

<BR>Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg'd none.

<BR>Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget;

<BR>For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd

<BR>Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay,

<BR>Yet empty of all good wherein consists

<BR>Womans domestic honour and chief praise;

<BR>Bred onely and completed to the taste

<BR>Of lustful apperence, to sing, to dance,

<BR>To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye.

<BR>To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives

<BR>Religious titl'd them the Sons of God,

<BR>Shall yeild up all thir vertue, all thir fame

<BR>Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles

<BR>Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy,

<BR>(Erelong to swim at larg) and laugh; for which

<BR>The world erelong a world of tears must weepe.

<BR>To whom thus ADAM of short joy bereft.

<BR>O pittie and shame, that they who to live well

<BR>Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread

<BR>Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint!

<BR>But still I see the tenor of Mans woe

<BR>Holds on the same, from Woman to begin.

<BR>From Mans effeminate slackness it begins,

<BR>Said th' Angel, who should better hold his place

<BR>By wisdome, and superiour gifts receavd.

<BR>But now prepare thee for another Scene.

<BR>He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred

<BR>Before him, Towns, and rural works between,

<BR>Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs,

<BR>Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr,

<BR>Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise;

<BR>Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed,

<BR>Single or in Array of Battel rang'd

<BR>Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood;

<BR>One way a Band select from forage drives

<BR>A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine

<BR>From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock,

<BR>Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine,

<BR>Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye,

<BR>But call in aide, which tacks a bloody Fray;

<BR>With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine;

<BR>Where Cattel pastur'd late, now scatterd lies

<BR>With Carcasses and Arms th' ensanguind Field

<BR>Deserted: Others to a Citie strong

<BR>Lay Siege, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine,

<BR>Assaulting; others from the Wall defend

<BR>With Dart and Jav'lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire;

<BR>On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds.

<BR>In other part the scepter'd Haralds call

<BR>To Council in the Citie Gates: anon

<BR>Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt,

<BR>Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon

<BR>In factious opposition, till at last

<BR>Of middle Age one rising, eminent

<BR>In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong,

<BR>Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace,

<BR>And Judgement from above: him old and young

<BR>Exploded, and had seiz'd with violent hands,

<BR>Had not a Cloud descending snatch'd him thence

<BR>Unseen amid the throng: so violence

<BR>Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law

<BR>Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found.

<BR>ADAM was all in tears, and to his guide

<BR>Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these,

<BR>Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death

<BR>Inhumanly to men, and multiply

<BR>Ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew

<BR>His Brother; for of whom such massacher

<BR>Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men?

<BR>But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav'n

<BR>Rescu'd, had in his Righteousness bin lost?

<BR>To whom thus MICHAEL; These are the product

<BR>Of those ill-mated Marriages thou saw'st;

<BR>Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves

<BR>Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt,

<BR>Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind.

<BR>Such were these Giants, men of high renown;

<BR>For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir'd,

<BR>And Valour and Heroic Vertu call'd;

<BR>To overcome in Battel, and subdue

<BR>Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite

<BR>Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch

<BR>Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done

<BR>Of triumph, to be styl'd great Conquerours,

<BR>Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods,

<BR>Destroyers rightlier call'd and Plagues of men.

<BR>Thus Fame shall be achiev'd, renown on Earth,

<BR>And what most merits fame in silence hid.

<BR>But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst

<BR>The onely righteous in a World perverse,

<BR>And therefore hated, therefore so beset

<BR>With Foes for daring single to be just,

<BR>And utter odious Truth, that God would come

<BR>To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High

<BR>Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds

<BR>Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God

<BR>High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss,

<BR>Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward

<BR>Awaits the good, the rest what punishment;

<BR>Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold.

<BR>He look'd, &amp; saw the face of things quite chang'd;

<BR>The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar,

<BR>All now was turn'd to jollitie and game,

<BR>To luxurie and riot, feast and dance,

<BR>Marrying or prostituting, as befell,

<BR>Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire

<BR>Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles.

<BR>At length a Reverend Sire among them came,

<BR>And of thir doings great dislike declar'd,

<BR>And testifi'd against thir wayes; hee oft

<BR>Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met,

<BR>Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd

<BR>Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls

<BR>In prison under Judgements imminent:

<BR>But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas'd

<BR>Contending, and remov'd his Tents farr off;

<BR>Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall,

<BR>Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk,

<BR>Measur'd by Cubit, length, &amp; breadth, and highth,

<BR>Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore

<BR>Contriv'd, and of provisions laid in large

<BR>For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange!

<BR>Of everie Beast, and Bird, and Insect small

<BR>Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught

<BR>Thir order; last the Sire, and his three Sons

<BR>With thir four Wives, and God made fast the dore.

<BR>Meanwhile the Southwind rose, &amp; with black wings

<BR>Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove

<BR>From under Heav'n; the Hills to their supplie

<BR>Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist,

<BR>Sent up amain; and now the thick'nd Skie

<BR>Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush'd the Rain

<BR>Impetuous, and continu'd till the Earth

<BR>No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum

<BR>Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow

<BR>Rode tilting o're the Waves, all dwellings else

<BR>Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp

<BR>Deep under water rould; Sea cover'd Sea,

<BR>Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces

<BR>Where luxurie late reign'd, Sea-monsters whelp'd

<BR>And stabl'd; of Mankind, so numerous late,

<BR>All left, in one small bottom swum imbark't.

<BR>How didst thou grieve then, ADAM, to behold

<BR>The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad,

<BR>Depopulation; thee another Floud,

<BR>Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown'd,

<BR>And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard

<BR>By th' Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last,

<BR>Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns

<BR>His Childern, all in view destroyd at once;

<BR>And scarce to th' Angel utterdst thus thy plaint.

<BR>O Visions ill foreseen! better had I

<BR>Liv'd ignorant of future, so had borne

<BR>My part of evil onely, each dayes lot

<BR>Anough to bear; those now, that were dispenst

<BR>The burd'n of many Ages, on me light

<BR>At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth

<BR>Abortive, to torment me ere thir being,

<BR>With thought that they must be. Let no man seek

<BR>Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall

<BR>Him or his Childern, evil he may be sure,

<BR>Which neither his foreknowing can prevent,

<BR>And hee the future evil shall no less

<BR>In apprehension then in substance feel

<BR>Grievous to bear: but that care now is past,

<BR>Man is not whom to warne: those few escap't

<BR>Famin and anguish will at last consume

<BR>Wandring that watrie Desert: I had hope

<BR>When violence was ceas't, and Warr on Earth,

<BR>All would have then gon well, peace would have crownd

<BR>With length of happy days the race of man;

<BR>But I was farr deceav'd; for now I see

<BR>Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste.

<BR>How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide,

<BR>And whether here the Race of man will end.

<BR>To whom thus MICHAEL. Those whom last thou sawst

<BR>In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they

<BR>First seen in acts of prowess eminent

<BR>And great exploits, but of true vertu void;

<BR>Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste

<BR>Subduing Nations, and achievd thereby

<BR>Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey,

<BR>Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth,

<BR>Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride

<BR>Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace.

<BR>The conquerd also, and enslav'd by Warr

<BR>Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose

<BR>And feare of God, from whom thir pietie feign'd

<BR>In sharp contest of Battel found no aide

<BR>Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale

<BR>Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure,

<BR>Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords

<BR>Shall leave them to enjoy; for th' Earth shall bear

<BR>More then anough, that temperance may be tri'd:

<BR>So all shall turn degenerate, all deprav'd,

<BR>Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot;

<BR>One Man except, the onely Son of light

<BR>In a dark Age, against example good,

<BR>Against allurement, custom, and a World

<BR>Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn,

<BR>Or violence, hee of thir wicked wayes

<BR>Shall them admonish, and before them set

<BR>The paths of righteousness, how much more safe,

<BR>And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come

<BR>On thir impenitence; and shall returne

<BR>Of them derided, but of God observd

<BR>The one just Man alive; by his command

<BR>Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst,

<BR>To save himself and houshold from amidst

<BR>A World devote to universal rack.

<BR>No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast

<BR>Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg'd,

<BR>And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts

<BR>Of Heav'n set open on the Earth shall powre

<BR>Raine day and night, all fountaines of the Deep

<BR>Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp

<BR>Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise

<BR>Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount

<BR>Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd

<BR>Out of his place, pushd by the horned floud,

<BR>With all his verdure spoil'd, and Trees adrift

<BR>Down the great River to the op'ning Gulf,

<BR>And there take root an Iland salt and bare,

<BR>The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang.

<BR>To teach thee that God attributes to place

<BR>No sanctitie, if none be thither brought

<BR>By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell.

<BR>And now what further shall ensue, behold.

<BR>He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud,

<BR>Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled,

<BR>Drivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drie

<BR>Wrinkl'd the face of Deluge, as decai'd;

<BR>And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass

<BR>Gaz'd hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew,

<BR>As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink

<BR>From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole

<BR>With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt

<BR>His Sluces, as the Heav'n his windows shut.

<BR>The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground

<BR>Fast on the top of som high mountain fixt.

<BR>And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer;

<BR>With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive

<BR>Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde.

<BR>Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies,

<BR>And after him, the surer messenger,

<BR>A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie

<BR>Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light;

<BR>The second time returning, in his Bill

<BR>An Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe:

<BR>Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke

<BR>The ancient Sire descends with all his Train;

<BR>Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout,

<BR>Grateful to Heav'n, over his head beholds

<BR>A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow

<BR>Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay,

<BR>Betok'ning peace from God, and Cov'nant new.

<BR>Whereat the heart of ADAM erst so sad

<BR>Greatly rejoyc'd, and thus his joy broke forth.

<BR>O thou that future things canst represent

<BR>As present, Heav'nly instructer, I revive

<BR>At this last sight, assur'd that Man shall live

<BR>With all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve.

<BR>Farr less I now lament for one whole World

<BR>Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce

<BR>For one Man found so perfet and so just,

<BR>That God voutsafes to raise another World

<BR>From him, and all his anger to forget.

<BR>But say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn,

<BR>Distended as the Brow of God appeas'd,

<BR>Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde

<BR>The fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud,

<BR>Least it again dissolve and showr the Earth?

<BR>To whom th' Archangel. Dextrously thou aim'st;

<BR>So willingly doth God remit his Ire,

<BR>Though late repenting him of Man deprav'd,

<BR>Griev'd at his heart, when looking down he saw

<BR>The whole Earth fill'd with violence, and all flesh

<BR>Corrupting each thir way; yet those remoov'd,

<BR>Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight,

<BR>That he relents, not to blot out mankind,

<BR>And makes a Covenant never to destroy

<BR>The Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea

<BR>Surpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World

<BR>With Man therein or Beast; but when he brings

<BR>Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein set

<BR>His triple-colour'd Bow, whereon to look

<BR>And call to mind his Cov'nant: Day and Night,

<BR>Seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost

<BR>Shall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new,

<BR>Both Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.

<BR>Thus thou hast seen one World begin and end;

<BR>And Man as from a second stock proceed.

<BR>Much thou hast yet to see, but I perceave

<BR>Thy mortal sight to faile; objects divine

<BR>Must needs impaire and wearie human sense:

<BR>Henceforth what is to com I will relate,

<BR>Thou therefore give due audience, and attend.

<BR>This second sours of Men, while yet but few,

<BR>And while the dread of judgement past remains

<BR>Fresh in thir mindes, fearing the Deitie,

<BR>With some regard to what is just and right

<BR>Shall lead thir lives, and multiplie apace,

<BR>Labouring the soile, and reaping plenteous crop,

<BR>Corn wine and oyle; and from the herd or flock,

<BR>Oft sacrificing Bullock, Lamb, or Kid,

<BR>With large Wine-offerings pour'd, and sacred Feast

<BR>Shal spend thir dayes in joy unblam'd, and dwell

<BR>Long time in peace by Families and Tribes

<BR>Under paternal rule; till one shall rise

<BR>Of proud ambitious heart, who not content

<BR>With fair equalitie, fraternal state,

<BR>Will arrogate Dominion undeserv'd

<BR>Over his brethren, and quite dispossess

<BR>Concord and law of Nature from the Earth;

<BR>Hunting (and Men not Beasts shall be his game)

<BR>With Warr and hostile snare such as refuse

<BR>Subjection to his Empire tyrannous:

<BR>A mightie Hunter thence he shall be styl'd

<BR>Before the Lord, as in despite of Heav'n,

<BR>Or from Heav'n claming second Sovrantie;

<BR>And from Rebellion shall derive his name,

<BR>Though of Rebellion others he accuse.

<BR>Hee with a crew, whom like Ambition joyns

<BR>With him or under him to tyrannize,

<BR>Marching from EDEN towards the West, shall finde

<BR>The Plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge

<BR>Boiles out from under ground, the mouth of Hell;

<BR>Of Brick, and of that stuff they cast to build

<BR>A Citie &amp; Towre, whose top may reach to Heav'n;

<BR>And get themselves a name, least far disperst

<BR>In foraign Lands thir memorie be lost,

<BR>Regardless whether good or evil fame.

<BR>But God who oft descends to visit men

<BR>Unseen, and through thir habitations walks

<BR>To mark thir doings, them beholding soon,

<BR>Comes down to see thir Citie, ere the Tower

<BR>Obstruct Heav'n Towrs, and in derision sets

<BR>Upon thir Tongues a various Spirit to rase

<BR>Quite out thir Native Language, and instead

<BR>To sow a jangling noise of words unknown:

<BR>Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud

<BR>Among the Builders; each to other calls

<BR>Not understood, till hoarse, and all in rage,

<BR>As mockt they storm; great laughter was in Heav'n

<BR>And looking down, to see the hubbub strange

<BR>And hear the din; thus was the building left

<BR>Ridiculous, and the work Confusion nam'd.

<BR>Whereto thus ADAM fatherly displeas'd.

<BR>O execrable Son so to aspire

<BR>Above his Brethren, to himself affirming

<BR>Authoritie usurpt, from God not giv'n:

<BR>He gave us onely over Beast, Fish, Fowl

<BR>Dominion absolute; that right we hold

<BR>By his donation; but Man over men

<BR>He made not Lord; such title to himself

<BR>Reserving, human left from human free.

<BR>But this Usurper his encroachment proud

<BR>Stayes not on Man; to God his Tower intends

<BR>Siege and defiance: Wretched man! what food

<BR>Will he convey up thither to sustain

<BR>Himself and his rash Armie, where thin Aire

<BR>Above the Clouds will pine his entrails gross,

<BR>And famish him of Breath, if not of Bread?

<BR>To whom thus MICHAEL. Justly thou abhorr'st

<BR>That Son, who on the quiet state of men

<BR>Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue

<BR>Rational Libertie; yet know withall,

<BR>Since thy original lapse, true Libertie

<BR>Is lost, which alwayes with right Reason dwells

<BR>Twinn'd, and from her hath no dividual being:

<BR>Reason in man obscur'd, or not obeyd,

<BR>Immediately inordinate desires

<BR>And upstart Passions catch the Government

<BR>From Reason, and to servitude reduce

<BR>Man till then free. Therefore since hee permits

<BR>Within himself unworthie Powers to reign

<BR>Over free Reason, God in Judgement just

<BR>Subjects him from without to violent Lords;

<BR>Who oft as undeservedly enthrall

<BR>His outward freedom: Tyrannie must be,

<BR>Though to the Tyrant thereby no excuse.

<BR>Yet somtimes Nations will decline so low

<BR>From vertue, which is reason, that no wrong,

<BR>But Justice, and some fatal curse annext

<BR>Deprives them of thir outward libertie,

<BR>Thir inward lost: Witness th' irreverent Son

<BR>Of him who built the Ark, who for the shame

<BR>Don to his Father, heard this heavie curse,

<BR>SERVANT OF SERVANTS, on his vitious Race.

<BR>Thus will this latter, as the former World,

<BR>Still tend from bad to worse, till God at last

<BR>Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw

<BR>His presence from among them, and avert

<BR>His holy Eyes; resolving from thenceforth

<BR>To leave them to thir own polluted wayes;

<BR>And one peculiar Nation to select

<BR>From all the rest, of whom to be invok'd,

<BR>A Nation from one faithful man to spring:

<BR>Him on this side EUPHRATES yet residing,

<BR>Bred up in Idol-worship; O that men

<BR>(Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown,

<BR>While yet the Patriark liv'd, who scap'd the Flood,

<BR>As to forsake the living God, and fall

<BR>To-worship thir own work in Wood and Stone

<BR>For Gods! yet him God the most High voutsafes

<BR>To call by Vision from his Fathers house,

<BR>His kindred and false Gods, into a Land

<BR>Which he will shew him, and from him will raise

<BR>A mightie Nation, and upon him showre

<BR>His benediction so, that in his Seed

<BR>All Nations shall be blest; hee straight obeys,

<BR>Not knowing to what Land, yet firm believes:

<BR>I see him, but thou canst not, with what Faith

<BR>He leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soile

<BR>UR of CHALDAEA, passing now the Ford

<BR>To HARAN, after him a cumbrous Train

<BR>Of Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude;

<BR>Not wandring poor, but trusting all his wealth

<BR>With God, who call'd him, in a land unknown.

<BR>CANAAN he now attains, I see his Tents

<BR>Pitcht about SECHEM, and the neighbouring Plaine

<BR>Of MOREB; there by promise he receaves

<BR>Gift to his Progenie of all that Land;

<BR>From HAMATH Northward to the Desert South

<BR>(Things by thir names I call, though yet unnam'd)

<BR>From HERMON East to the great Western Sea,

<BR>Mount HERMON, yonder Sea, each place behold

<BR>In prospect, as I point them; on the shoare

<BR>Mount CARMEL; here the double-founted stream

<BR>JORDAN, true limit Eastward; but his Sons

<BR>Shall dwell to SENIR, that long ridge of Hills.

<BR>This ponder, that all Nations of the Earth

<BR>Shall in his Seed be blessed; by that Seed

<BR>Is meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise

<BR>The Serpents head; whereof to thee anon

<BR>Plainlier shall be reveald. This Patriarch blest,

<BR>Whom FAITHFUL ABRAHAM due time shall call,

<BR>A Son, and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves,

<BR>Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown;

<BR>The Grandchilde with twelve Sons increast, departs

<BR>From CANAAN, to a Land hereafter call'd

<BR>EGYPT, divided by the River NILE;

<BR>See where it flows, disgorging at seaven mouthes

<BR>Into the Sea: to sojourn in that Land

<BR>He comes invited by a yonger Son

<BR>In time of dearth, a Son whose worthy deeds

<BR>Raise him to be the second in that Realme

<BR>Of PHARAO: there he dies, and leaves his Race

<BR>Growing into a Nation, and now grown

<BR>Suspected to a sequent King, who seeks

<BR>To stop thir overgrowth, as inmate guests

<BR>Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves

<BR>Inhospitably, and kills thir infant Males:

<BR>Till by two brethren (those two brethren call

<BR>MOSES and AARON) sent from God to claime

<BR>His people from enthralment, they return

<BR>With glory and spoile back to thir promis'd Land.

<BR>But first the lawless Tyrant, who denies

<BR>To know thir God, or message to regard,

<BR>Must be compelld by Signes and Judgements dire;

<BR>To blood unshed the Rivers must be turnd,

<BR>Frogs, Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill

<BR>With loath'd intrusion, and fill all the land;

<BR>His Cattel must of Rot and Murren die,

<BR>Botches and blaines must all his flesh imboss,

<BR>And all his people; Thunder mixt with Haile,

<BR>Haile mixt with fire must rend th' EGYPTIAN Skie

<BR>And wheel on th' Earth, devouring where it rouls;

<BR>What it devours not, Herb, or Fruit, or Graine,

<BR>A darksom Cloud of Locusts swarming down

<BR>Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green:

<BR>Darkness must overshadow all his bounds,

<BR>Palpable darkness, and blot out three dayes;

<BR>Last with one midnight stroke all the first-born

<BR>Of EGYPT must lie dead. Thus with ten wounds

<BR>This River-dragon tam'd at length submits

<BR>To let his sojourners depart, and oft

<BR>Humbles his stubborn heart, but still as Ice

<BR>More hard'nd after thaw, till in his rage

<BR>Pursuing whom he late dismissd, the Sea

<BR>Swallows him with his Host, but them lets pass

<BR>As on drie land between two christal walls,

<BR>Aw'd by the rod of MOSES so to stand

<BR>Divided, till his rescu'd gain thir shoar:

<BR>Such wondrous power God to his Saint will lend,

<BR>Though present in his Angel, who shall goe

<BR>Before them in a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire,

<BR>To guide them in thir journey, and remove

<BR>Behinde them, while th' obdurat King pursues:

<BR>All night he will pursue, but his approach

<BR>Darkness defends between till morning Watch;

<BR>Then through the Firey Pillar and the Cloud

<BR>God looking forth will trouble all his Host

<BR>And craze thir Chariot wheels: when by command

<BR>MOSES once more his potent Rod extends

<BR>Over the Sea; the Sea his Rod obeys;

<BR>On thir imbattelld ranks the Waves return,

<BR>And overwhelm thir Warr: the Race elect

<BR>Safe towards CANAAN from the shoar advance

<BR>Through the wilde Desert, not the readiest way,

<BR>Least entring on the CANAANITE allarmd

<BR>Warr terrifie them inexpert, and feare

<BR>Return them back to EGYPT, choosing rather

<BR>Inglorious life with servitude; for life

<BR>To noble and ignoble is more sweet

<BR>Untraind in Armes, where rashness leads not on.

<BR>This also shall they gain by thir delay

<BR>In the wide Wilderness, there they shall found

<BR>Thir government, and thir great Senate choose

<BR>Through the twelve Tribes, to rule by Laws ordaind:

<BR>God from the Mount of SINAI, whose gray top

<BR>Shall tremble, he descending, will himself

<BR>In Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound

<BR>Ordaine them Lawes; part such as appertaine

<BR>To civil Justice, part religious Rites

<BR>Of sacrifice, informing them, by types

<BR>And shadowes, of that destind Seed to bruise

<BR>The Serpent, by what meanes he shall achieve

<BR>Mankinds deliverance. But the voice of God

<BR>To mortal eare is dreadful; they beseech

<BR>That MOSES might report to them his will,

<BR>And terror cease; he grants them thir desire,

<BR>Instructed that to God is no access

<BR>Without Mediator, whose high Office now

<BR>MOSES in figure beares, to introduce

<BR>One greater, of whose day he shall foretell,

<BR>And all the Prophets in thir Age the times

<BR>Of great MESSIAH shall sing. Thus Laws and Rites

<BR>Establisht, such delight hath God in Men

<BR>Obedient to his will, that he voutsafes

<BR>Among them to set up his Tabernacle,

<BR>The holy One with mortal Men to dwell:

<BR>By his prescript a Sanctuary is fram'd

<BR>Of Cedar, overlaid with Gold, therein

<BR>An Ark, and in the Ark his Testimony,

<BR>The Records of his Cov'nant, over these

<BR>A Mercie-seat of Gold between the wings

<BR>Of two bright Cherubim, before him burn

<BR>Seaven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing

<BR>The Heav'nly fires; over the Tent a Cloud

<BR>Shall rest by Day, a fierie gleame by Night,

<BR>Save when they journie, and at length they come,

<BR>Conducted by his Angel to the Land

<BR>Promisd to ABRAHAM and his Seed: the rest

<BR>Were long to tell, how many Battels fought,

<BR>How many Kings destroyd, and Kingdoms won,

<BR>Or how the Sun shall in mid Heav'n stand still

<BR>A day entire, and Nights due course adjourne,

<BR>Mans voice commanding, Sun in GIBEON stand,

<BR>And thou Moon in the vale of AIALON,

<BR>Till ISRAEL overcome; so call the third

<BR>From ABRAHAM, Son of ISAAC, and from him

<BR>His whole descent, who thus shall CANAAN win.

<BR>Here ADAM interpos'd. O sent from Heav'n,

<BR>Enlightner of my darkness, gracious things

<BR>Thou hast reveald, those chiefly which concerne

<BR>Just ABRAHAM and his Seed: now first I finde

<BR>Mine eyes true op'ning, and my heart much eas'd,

<BR>Erwhile perplext with thoughts what would becom

<BR>Of mee and all Mankind; but now I see

<BR>His day, in whom all Nations shall be blest,

<BR>Favour unmerited by me, who sought

<BR>Forbidd'n knowledge by forbidd'n means.

<BR>This yet I apprehend not, why to those

<BR>Among whom God will deigne to dwell on Earth

<BR>So many and so various Laws are giv'n;

<BR>So many Laws argue so many sins

<BR>Among them; how can God with such reside?

<BR>To whom thus MICHAEL. Doubt not but that sin

<BR>Will reign among them, as of thee begot;

<BR>And therefore was Law given them to evince

<BR>Thir natural pravitie, by stirring up

<BR>Sin against Law to fight; that when they see

<BR>Law can discover sin, but not remove,

<BR>Save by those shadowie expiations weak,

<BR>The bloud of Bulls and Goats, they may conclude

<BR>Some bloud more precious must be paid for Man,

<BR>Just for unjust, that in such righteousness

<BR>To them by Faith imputed, they may finde

<BR>Justification towards God, and peace

<BR>Of Conscience, which the Law by Ceremonies

<BR>Cannot appease, nor Man the moral part

<BR>Perform, and not performing cannot live.

<BR>So Law appears imperfet, and but giv'n

<BR>With purpose to resign them in full time

<BR>Up to a better Cov'nant, disciplin'd

<BR>From shadowie Types to Truth, from Flesh to Spirit,

<BR>From imposition of strict Laws, to free

<BR>Acceptance of large Grace, from servil fear

<BR>To filial, works of Law to works of Faith.

<BR>And therefore shall not MOSES, though of God

<BR>Highly belov'd, being but the Minister

<BR>Of Law, his people into CANAAN lead;

<BR>But JOSHUA whom the Gentiles JESUS call,

<BR>His Name and Office bearing, who shall quell

<BR>The adversarie Serpent, and bring back

<BR>Through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man

<BR>Safe to eternal Paradise of rest.

<BR>Meanwhile they in thir earthly CANAAN plac't

<BR>Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins

<BR>National interrupt thir public peace,

<BR>Provoking God to raise them enemies:

<BR>From whom as oft he saves them penitent

<BR>By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom

<BR>The second, both for pietie renownd

<BR>And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive

<BR>Irrevocable, that his Regal Throne

<BR>For ever shall endure; the like shall sing

<BR>All Prophecie, That of the Royal Stock

<BR>Of DAVID (so I name this King) shall rise

<BR>A Son, the Womans Seed to thee foretold,

<BR>Foretold to ABRAHAM, as in whom shall trust

<BR>All Nations, and to Kings foretold, of Kings

<BR>The last, for of his Reign shall be no end.

<BR>But first a long succession must ensue,

<BR>And his next Son for Wealth and Wisdom fam'd,

<BR>The clouded Ark of God till then in Tents

<BR>Wandring, shall in a glorious Temple enshrine.

<BR>Such follow him, as shall be registerd

<BR>Part good, part bad, of bad the longer scrowle,

<BR>Whose foul Idolatries, and other faults

<BR>Heapt to the popular summe, will so incense

<BR>God, as to leave them, and expose thir Land,

<BR>Thir Citie, his Temple, and his holy Ark

<BR>With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey

<BR>To that proud Citie, whose high Walls thou saw'st

<BR>Left in confusion, BABYLON thence call'd.

<BR>There in captivitie he lets them dwell

<BR>The space of seventie years, then brings them back,

<BR>Remembring mercie, and his Cov'nant sworn

<BR>To DAVID, stablisht as the dayes of Heav'n.

<BR>Returnd from BABYLON by leave of Kings

<BR>Thir Lords, whom God dispos'd, the house of God

<BR>They first re-edifie, and for a while

<BR>In mean estate live moderate, till grown

<BR>In wealth and multitude, factious they grow;

<BR>But first among the Priests dissension springs,

<BR>Men who attend the Altar, and should most

<BR>Endeavour Peace: thir strife pollution brings

<BR>Upon the Temple it self: at last they seise

<BR>The Scepter, and regard not DAVIDS Sons,

<BR>Then loose it to a stranger, that the true

<BR>Anointed King MESSIAH might be born

<BR>Barr'd of his right; yet at his Birth a Starr

<BR>Unseen before in Heav'n proclaims him com,

<BR>And guides the Eastern Sages, who enquire

<BR>His place, to offer Incense, Myrrh, and Gold;

<BR>His place of birth a solemn Angel tells

<BR>To simple Shepherds, keeping watch by night;

<BR>They gladly thither haste, and by a Quire

<BR>Of squadrond Angels hear his Carol sung.

<BR>A Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire

<BR>The Power of the most High; he shall ascend

<BR>The Throne hereditarie, and bound his Reign

<BR>With earths wide bounds, his glory with the Heav'ns.

<BR>He ceas'd, discerning ADAM with such joy

<BR>Surcharg'd, as had like grief bin dew'd in tears,

<BR>Without the vent of words, which these he breathd.

<BR>O Prophet of glad tidings, finisher

<BR>Of utmost hope! now clear I understand

<BR>What oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain,

<BR>Why our great expectation should be call'd

<BR>The seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, Haile,

<BR>High in the love of Heav'n, yet from my Loynes

<BR>Thou shalt proceed, and from thy Womb the Son

<BR>Of God most High; So God with man unites.

<BR>Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise

<BR>Expect with mortal paine: say where and when

<BR>Thir fight, what stroke shall bruise the Victors heel.

<BR>To whom thus MICHAEL. Dream not of thir fight,

<BR>As of a Duel, or the local wounds

<BR>Of head or heel: not therefore joynes the Son

<BR>Manhood to God-head, with more strength to foil

<BR>Thy enemie; nor so is overcome

<BR>SATAN, whose fall from Heav'n, a deadlier bruise,

<BR>Disabl'd not to give thee thy deaths wound:

<BR>Which hee, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure,

<BR>Not by destroying SATAN, but his works

<BR>In thee and in thy Seed: nor can this be,

<BR>But by fulfilling that which thou didst want,

<BR>Obedience to the Law of God, impos'd

<BR>On penaltie of death, and suffering death,

<BR>The penaltie to thy transgression due,

<BR>And due to theirs which out of thine will grow:

<BR>So onely can high Justice rest appaid.

<BR>The Law of God exact he shall fulfill

<BR>Both by obedience and by love, though love

<BR>Alone fulfill the Law; thy punishment

<BR>He shall endure by coming in the Flesh

<BR>To a reproachful life and cursed death,

<BR>Proclaiming Life to all who shall believe

<BR>In his redemption, and that his obedience

<BR>Imputed becomes theirs by Faith, his merits

<BR>To save them, not thir own, though legal works.

<BR>For this he shall live hated, be blasphem'd,

<BR>Seis'd on by force, judg'd, and to death condemnd

<BR>A shameful and accurst, naild to the Cross

<BR>By his own Nation, slaine for bringing Life;

<BR>But to the Cross he nailes thy Enemies,

<BR>The Law that is against thee, and the sins

<BR>Of all mankinde, with him there crucifi'd,

<BR>Never to hurt them more who rightly trust

<BR>In this his satisfaction; so he dies,

<BR>But soon revives, Death over him no power

<BR>Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light

<BR>Returne, the Starres of Morn shall see him rise

<BR>Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light,

<BR>Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems,

<BR>His death for Man, as many as offerd Life

<BR>Neglect not, and the benefit imbrace

<BR>By Faith not void of works: this God-like act

<BR>Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldst have dy'd,

<BR>In sin for ever lost from life; this act

<BR>Shall bruise the head of SATAN, crush his strength

<BR>Defeating Sin and Death, his two maine armes,

<BR>And fix farr deeper in his head thir stings

<BR>Then temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel,

<BR>Or theirs whom he redeems, a death like sleep,

<BR>A gentle wafting to immortal Life.

<BR>Nor after resurrection shall he stay

<BR>Longer on Earth then certaine times to appeer

<BR>To his Disciples, Men who in his Life

<BR>Still follow'd him; to them shall leave in charge

<BR>To teach all nations what of him they learn'd

<BR>And his Salvation, them who shall beleeve

<BR>Baptizing in the profluent streame, the signe

<BR>Of washing them from guilt of sin to Life

<BR>Pure, and in mind prepar'd, if so befall,

<BR>For death, like that which the redeemer dy'd.

<BR>All Nations they shall teach; for from that day

<BR>Not onely to the Sons of ABRAHAMS Loines

<BR>Salvation shall be Preacht, but to the Sons

<BR>Of ABRAHAMS Faith wherever through the world;

<BR>So in his seed all Nations shall be blest.

<BR>Then to the Heav'n of Heav'ns he shall ascend

<BR>With victory, triumphing through the aire

<BR>Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise

<BR>The Serpent, Prince of aire, and drag in Chaines

<BR>Through all his realme, &amp; there confounded leave;

<BR>Then enter into glory, and resume

<BR>His Seat at Gods right hand, exalted high

<BR>Above all names in Heav'n; and thence shall come,

<BR>When this worlds dissolution shall be ripe,

<BR>With glory and power to judge both quick &amp; dead,

<BR>To judge th' unfaithful dead, but to reward

<BR>His faithful, and receave them into bliss,

<BR>Whether in Heav'n or Earth, for then the Earth

<BR>Shall all be Paradise, far happier place

<BR>Then this of EDEN, and far happier daies.

<BR>So spake th' Archangel MICHAEL, then paus'd,

<BR>As at the Worlds great period; and our Sire

<BR>Replete with joy and wonder thus repli'd.

<BR>O goodness infinite, goodness immense!

<BR>That all this good of evil shall produce,

<BR>And evil turn to good; more wonderful

<BR>Then that which by creation first brought forth

<BR>Light out of darkness! full of doubt I stand,

<BR>Whether I should repent me now of sin

<BR>By mee done and occasiond, or rejoyce

<BR>Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring,

<BR>To God more glory, more good will to Men

<BR>From God, and over wrauth grace shall abound.

<BR>But say, if our deliverer up to Heav'n

<BR>Must reascend, what will betide the few

<BR>His faithful, left among th' unfaithful herd,

<BR>The enemies of truth; who then shall guide

<BR>His people, who defend? will they not deale

<BR>Wors with his followers then with him they dealt?

<BR>Be sure they will, said th' Angel; but from Heav'n

<BR>Hee to his own a Comforter will send,

<BR>The promise of the Father, who shall dwell

<BR>His Spirit within them, and the Law of Faith

<BR>Working through love, upon thir hearts shall write,

<BR>To guide them in all truth, and also arme

<BR>With spiritual Armour, able to resist

<BR>SATANS assaults, and quench his fierie darts

<BR>What Man can do against them, not affraid,

<BR>Though to the death, against such cruelties

<BR>With inward consolations recompenc't,

<BR>And oft supported so as shall amaze

<BR>Thir proudest persecuters: for the Spirit

<BR>Powrd first on his Apostles, whom he sends

<BR>To evangelize the Nations, then on all

<BR>Baptiz'd, shall them with wondrous gifts endue

<BR>To speak all Tongues, and do all Miracles,

<BR>As did thir Lord before them. Thus they win

<BR>Great numbers of each Nation to receave

<BR>With joy the tidings brought from Heav'n: at length

<BR>Thir Ministry perform'd, and race well run,

<BR>Thir doctrine and thir story written left,

<BR>They die; but in thir room, as they forewarne,

<BR>Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous Wolves,

<BR>Who all the sacred mysteries of Heav'n

<BR>To thir own vile advantages shall turne

<BR>Of lucre and ambition, and the truth

<BR>With superstitions and traditions taint,

<BR>Left onely in those written Records pure,

<BR>Though not but by the Spirit understood.

<BR>Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names,

<BR>Places and titles, and with these to joine

<BR>Secular power, though feigning still to act

<BR>By spiritual, to themselves appropriating

<BR>The Spirit of God, promisd alike and giv'n

<BR>To all Beleevers; and from that pretense,

<BR>Spiritual Lawes by carnal power shall force

<BR>On every conscience; Laws which none shall finde

<BR>Left them inrould, or what the Spirit within

<BR>Shall on the heart engrave. What will they then

<BR>But force the Spirit of Grace it self, and binde

<BR>His consort Libertie; what, but unbuild

<BR>His living Temples, built by Faith to stand,

<BR>Thir own Faith not anothers: for on Earth

<BR>Who against Faith and Conscience can be heard

<BR>Infallible? yet many will presume:

<BR>Whence heavie persecution shall arise

<BR>On all who in the worship persevere

<BR>Of Spirit and Truth; the rest, farr greater part,

<BR>Will deem in outward Rites and specious formes

<BR>Religion satisfi'd; Truth shall retire

<BR>Bestuck with slandrous darts, and works of Faith

<BR>Rarely be found: so shall the World goe on,

<BR>To good malignant, to bad men benigne,

<BR>Under her own waight groaning, till the day

<BR>Appeer of respiration to the just,

<BR>And vengeance to the wicked, at return

<BR>Of him so lately promis'd to thy aid,

<BR>The Womans seed, obscurely then foretold,

<BR>Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord,

<BR>Last in the Clouds from Heav'n to be reveald

<BR>In glory of the Father, to dissolve

<BR>SATAN with his perverted World, then raise

<BR>From the conflagrant mass, purg'd and refin'd,

<BR>New Heav'ns, new Earth, Ages of endless date

<BR>Founded in righteousness and peace and love,

<BR>To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss.

<BR>He ended; and thus ADAM last reply'd.

<BR>How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest,

<BR>Measur'd this transient World, the Race of time,

<BR>Till time stand fixt: beyond is all abyss,

<BR>Eternitie, whose end no eye can reach.

<BR>Greatly instructed I shall hence depart,

<BR>Greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill

<BR>Of knowledge, what this vessel can containe;

<BR>Beyond which was my folly to aspire.

<BR>Henceforth I learne, that to obey is best,

<BR>And love with feare the onely God, to walk

<BR>As in his presence, ever to observe

<BR>His providence, and on him sole depend,

<BR>Merciful over all his works, with good

<BR>Still overcoming evil, and by small

<BR>Accomplishing great things, by things deemd weak

<BR>Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise

<BR>By simply meek; that suffering for Truths sake

<BR>Is fortitude to highest victorie,

<BR>And to the faithful Death the Gate of Life;

<BR>Taught this by his example whom I now

<BR>Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest.

<BR>To whom thus also th' Angel last repli'd:

<BR>This having learnt, thou hast attaind the summe

<BR>Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the Starrs

<BR>Thou knewst by name, and all th' ethereal Powers,

<BR>All secrets of the deep, all Natures works,

<BR>Or works of God in Heav'n, Air, Earth, or Sea,

<BR>And all the riches of this World enjoydst,

<BR>And all the rule, one Empire; onely add

<BR>Deeds to thy knowledge answerable, add Faith,

<BR>Add Vertue, Patience, Temperance, add Love,

<BR>By name to come call'd Charitie, the soul

<BR>Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath

<BR>To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess

<BR>A Paradise within thee, happier farr.

<BR>Let us descend now therefore from this top

<BR>Of Speculation; for the hour precise

<BR>Exacts our parting hence; and see the Guards,

<BR>By mee encampt on yonder Hill, expect

<BR>Thir motion, at whose Front a flaming Sword,

<BR>In signal of remove, waves fiercely round;

<BR>We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve;

<BR>Her also I with gentle Dreams have calm'd

<BR>Portending good, and all her spirits compos'd

<BR>To meek submission: thou at season fit

<BR>Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard,

<BR>Chiefly what may concern her Faith to know,

<BR>The great deliverance by her Seed to come

<BR>(For by the Womans Seed) on all Mankind.

<BR>That ye may live, which will be many dayes,

<BR>Both in one Faith unanimous though sad,

<BR>With cause for evils past, yet much more cheer'd

<BR>With meditation on the happie end.

<BR>He ended, and they both descend the Hill;

<BR>Descended, ADAM to the Bowre where EVE

<BR>Lay sleeping ran before, but found her wak't;

<BR>And thus with words not sad she him receav'd.

<BR>Whence thou returnst, &amp; whither wentst, I know;

<BR>For God is also in sleep, and Dreams advise,

<BR>Which he hath sent propitious, some great good

<BR>Presaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress

<BR>VVearied I fell asleep: but now lead on;

<BR>In mee is no delay; with thee to goe,

<BR>Is to stay here; without thee here to stay,

<BR>Is to go hence unwilling; thou to mee

<BR>Art all things under Heav'n, all places thou,

<BR>VVho for my wilful crime art banisht hence.

<BR>This further consolation yet secure

<BR>I carry hence; though all by mee is lost,

<BR>Such favour I unworthie am voutsaft,

<BR>By mee the Promis'd Seed shall all restore.

<BR>So spake our Mother EVE, and ADAM heard

<BR>VVell pleas'd, but answer'd not; for now too nigh

<BR>Th' Archangel stood, and from the other Hill

<BR>To thir fixt Station, all in bright array

<BR>The Cherubim descended; on the ground

<BR>Gliding meteorous, as Ev'ning Mist

<BR>Ris'n from a River o're the marish glides,

<BR>And gathers ground fast at the Labourers heel

<BR>Homeward returning. High in Front advanc't,

<BR>The brandisht Sword of God before them blaz'd

<BR>Fierce as a Comet; which with torrid heat,

<BR>And vapour as the LIBYAN Air adust,

<BR>Began to parch that temperate Clime; whereat

<BR>In either hand the hastning Angel caught

<BR>Our lingring Parents, and to th' Eastern Gate

<BR>Let them direct, and down the Cliff as fast

<BR>To the subjected Plaine; then disappeer'd.

<BR>They looking back, all th' Eastern side beheld

<BR>Of Paradise, so late thir happie seat,

<BR>Wav'd over by that flaming Brand, the Gate

<BR>With dreadful Faces throng'd and fierie Armes:

<BR>Som natural tears they drop'd, but wip'd them soon;

<BR>The World was all before them, where to choose

<BR>Thir place of rest, and Providence thir guide:

<BR>They hand in hand with wandring steps and slow,

<BR>Through EDEN took thir solitarie way.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Book 6</H3>



<BLOCKQUOTE>All night the dreadless Angel unpursu'd

<BR>Through Heav'ns wide Champain held his way, till Morn,

<BR>Wak't by the circling Hours, with rosie hand

<BR>Unbarr'd the gates of Light. There is a Cave

<BR>Within the Mount of God, fast by his Throne,

<BR>Where light and darkness in perpetual round

<BR>Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heav'n

<BR>Grateful vicissitude, like Day and Night;

<BR>Light issues forth, and at the other dore

<BR>Obsequious darkness enters, till her houre

<BR>To veile the Heav'n, though darkness there might well

<BR>Seem twilight here; and now went forth the Morn

<BR>Such as in highest Heav'n, arrayd in Gold

<BR>Empyreal, from before her vanisht Night,

<BR>Shot through with orient Beams: when all the Plain

<BR>Coverd with thick embatteld Squadrons bright,

<BR>Chariots and flaming Armes, and fierie Steeds

<BR>Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view:

<BR>Warr he perceav'd, warr in procinct, and found

<BR>Already known what he for news had thought

<BR>To have reported: gladly then he mixt

<BR>Among those friendly Powers who him receav'd

<BR>With joy and acclamations loud, that one

<BR>That of so many Myriads fall'n, yet one

<BR>Returnd not lost: On to the sacred hill

<BR>They led him high applauded, and present

<BR>Before the seat supream; from whence a voice

<BR>From midst a Golden Cloud thus milde was heard.

<BR>Servant of God, well done, well hast thou fought

<BR>The better fight, who single hast maintaind

<BR>Against revolted multitudes the Cause

<BR>Of Truth, in word mightier then they in Armes;

<BR>And for the testimonie of Truth hast born

<BR>Universal reproach, far worse to beare

<BR>Then violence: for this was all thy care

<BR>To stand approv'd in sight of God, though Worlds

<BR>Judg'd thee perverse: the easier conquest now

<BR>Remains thee, aided by this host of friends,

<BR>Back on thy foes more glorious to return

<BR>Then scornd thou didst depart, and to subdue

<BR>By force, who reason for thir Law refuse,

<BR>Right reason for thir Law, and for thir King

<BR>MESSIAH, who by right of merit Reigns.

<BR>Goe MICHAEL of Celestial Armies Prince,

<BR>And thou in Military prowess next

<BR>GABRIEL, lead forth to Battel these my Sons

<BR>Invincible, lead forth my armed Saints

<BR>By Thousands and by Millions rang'd for fight;

<BR>Equal in number to that Godless crew

<BR>Rebellious, them with Fire and hostile Arms

<BR>Fearless assault, and to the brow of Heav'n

<BR>Pursuing drive them out from God and bliss,

<BR>Into thir place of punishment, the Gulf

<BR>Of TARTARUS, which ready opens wide

<BR>His fiery CHAOS to receave thir fall.

<BR>So spake the Sovran voice, and Clouds began

<BR>To darken all the Hill, and smoak to rowl

<BR>In duskie wreathes, reluctant flames, the signe

<BR>Of wrauth awak't: nor with less dread the loud

<BR>Ethereal Trumpet from on high gan blow:

<BR>At which command the Powers Militant,

<BR>That stood for Heav'n, in mighty Quadrate joyn'd

<BR>Of Union irresistible, mov'd on

<BR>In silence thir bright Legions, to the sound

<BR>Of instrumental Harmonie that breath'd

<BR>Heroic Ardor to advent'rous deeds

<BR>Under thir God-like Leaders, in the Cause

<BR>Of God and his MESSIAH. On they move

<BR>Indissolubly firm; nor obvious Hill,

<BR>Nor streit'ning Vale, nor Wood, nor Stream divides

<BR>Thir perfet ranks; for high above the ground

<BR>Thir march was, and the passive Air upbore

<BR>Thir nimble tread; as when the total kind

<BR>Of Birds in orderly array on wing

<BR>Came summond over EDEN to receive

<BR>Thir names of thee; so over many a tract

<BR>Of Heav'n they march'd, and many a Province wide

<BR>Tenfold the length of this terrene: at last

<BR>Farr in th' Horizon to the North appeer'd

<BR>From skirt to skirt a fierie Region, stretcht

<BR>In battailous aspect, and neerer view

<BR>Bristl'd with upright beams innumerable

<BR>Of rigid Spears, and Helmets throng'd, and Shields

<BR>Various, with boastful Argument portraid,

<BR>The banded Powers of SATAN hasting on

<BR>With furious expedition; for they weend

<BR>That self same day by fight, or by surprize

<BR>To win the Mount of God, and on his Throne

<BR>To set the envier of his State, the proud

<BR>Aspirer, but thir thoughts prov'd fond and vain

<BR>In the mid way: though strange to us it seemd

<BR>At first, that Angel should with Angel warr,

<BR>And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet

<BR>So oft in Festivals of joy and love

<BR>Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire

<BR>Hymning th' Eternal Father: but the shout

<BR>Of Battel now began, and rushing sound

<BR>Of onset ended soon each milder thought.

<BR>High in the midst exalted as a God

<BR>Th' Apostat in his Sun-bright Chariot sate

<BR>Idol of Majestie Divine, enclos'd

<BR>With Flaming Cherubim, and golden Shields;

<BR>Then lighted from his gorgeous Throne, for now

<BR>'Twixt Host and Host but narrow space was left,

<BR>A dreadful interval, and Front to Front

<BR>Presented stood in terrible array

<BR>Of hideous length: before the cloudie Van,

<BR>On the rough edge of battel ere it joyn'd,

<BR>SATAN with vast and haughtie strides advanc't,

<BR>Came towring, armd in Adamant and Gold;

<BR>ABDIEL that sight endur'd not, where he stood

<BR>Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds,

<BR>And thus his own undaunted heart explores.

<BR>O Heav'n! that such resemblance of the Highest

<BR>Should yet remain, where faith and realtie

<BR>Remain not; wherfore should not strength &amp; might

<BR>There fail where Vertue fails, or weakest prove

<BR>Where boldest; though to sight unconquerable?

<BR>His puissance, trusting in th' Almightie's aide,

<BR>I mean to try, whose Reason I have tri'd

<BR>Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just,

<BR>That he who in debate of Truth hath won,

<BR>Should win in Arms, in both disputes alike

<BR>Victor; though brutish that contest and foule,

<BR>When Reason hath to deal with force, yet so

<BR>Most reason is that Reason overcome.

<BR>So pondering, and from his armed Peers

<BR>Forth stepping opposite, half way he met

<BR>His daring foe, at this prevention more

<BR>Incens't, and thus securely him defi'd.

<BR>Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reacht

<BR>The highth of thy aspiring unoppos'd,

<BR>The Throne of God unguarded, and his side

<BR>Abandond at the terror of thy Power

<BR>Or potent tongue; fool, not to think how vain

<BR>Against th' Omnipotent to rise in Arms;

<BR>Who out of smallest things could without end

<BR>Have rais'd incessant Armies to defeat

<BR>Thy folly; or with solitarie hand

<BR>Reaching beyond all limit, at one blow

<BR>Unaided could have finisht thee, and whelmd

<BR>Thy Legions under darkness; but thou seest

<BR>All are not of thy Train; there be who Faith

<BR>Prefer, and Pietie to God, though then

<BR>To thee not visible, when I alone

<BR>Seemd in thy World erroneous to dissent

<BR>From all: my Sect thou seest, now learn too late

<BR>How few somtimes may know, when thousands err.

<BR>Whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance

<BR>Thus answerd. Ill for thee, but in wisht houre

<BR>Of my revenge, first sought for thou returnst

<BR>From flight, seditious Angel, to receave

<BR>Thy merited reward, the first assay

<BR>Of this right hand provok't, since first that tongue

<BR>Inspir'd with contradiction durst oppose

<BR>A third part of the Gods, in Synod met

<BR>Thir Deities to assert, who while they feel

<BR>Vigour Divine within them, can allow

<BR>Omnipotence to none. But well thou comst

<BR>Before thy fellows, ambitious to win

<BR>From me som Plume, that thy success may show

<BR>Destruction to the rest: this pause between

<BR>(Unanswerd least thou boast) to let thee know;

<BR>At first I thought that Libertie and Heav'n

<BR>To heav'nly Soules had bin all one; but now

<BR>I see that most through sloth had rather serve,

<BR>Ministring Spirits, traind up in Feast and Song;

<BR>Such hast thou arm'd, the Minstrelsie of Heav'n,

<BR>Servilitie with freedom to contend,

<BR>As both thir deeds compar'd this day shall prove.

<BR>To whom in brief thus ABDIEL stern repli'd.

<BR>Apostat, still thou errst, nor end wilt find

<BR>Of erring, from the path of truth remote:

<BR>Unjustly thou deprav'st it with the name

<BR>Of SERVITUDE to serve whom God ordains,

<BR>Or Nature; God and Nature bid the same,

<BR>When he who rules is worthiest, and excells

<BR>Them whom he governs. This is servitude,

<BR>To serve th' unwise, or him who hath rebelld

<BR>Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee,

<BR>Thy self not free, but to thy self enthrall'd;

<BR>Yet leudly dar'st our ministring upbraid.

<BR>Reign thou in Hell thy Kingdom, let mee serve

<BR>In Heav'n God ever blessed, and his Divine

<BR>Behests obey, worthiest to be obey'd,

<BR>Yet Chains in Hell, not Realms expect: mean while

<BR>From mee returnd, as erst thou saidst, from flight,

<BR>This greeting on thy impious Crest receive.

<BR>So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high,

<BR>Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell

<BR>On the proud Crest of SATAN, that no sight,

<BR>Nor motion of swift thought, less could his Shield

<BR>Such ruin intercept: ten paces huge

<BR>He back recoild; the tenth on bended knee

<BR>His massie Spear upstaid; as if on Earth

<BR>Winds under ground or waters forcing way

<BR>Sidelong, had push't a Mountain from his seat

<BR>Half sunk with all his Pines. Amazement seis'd

<BR>The Rebel Thrones, but greater rage to see

<BR>Thus foil'd thir mightiest, ours joy filld, and shout,

<BR>Presage of Victorie and fierce desire

<BR>Of Battel: whereat MICHAEL bid sound

<BR>Th' Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heav'n

<BR>It sounded, and the faithful Armies rung

<BR>HOSANNA to the Highest: nor stood at gaze

<BR>The adverse Legions, nor less hideous joyn'd

<BR>The horrid shock: now storming furie rose,

<BR>And clamour such as heard in Heav'n till now

<BR>Was never, Arms on Armour clashing bray'd

<BR>Horrible discord, and the madding Wheeles

<BR>Of brazen Chariots rag'd; dire was the noise

<BR>Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss

<BR>Of fiery Darts in flaming volies flew,

<BR>And flying vaulted either Host with fire.

<BR>Sounder fierie Cope together rush'd

<BR>Both Battels maine, with ruinous assault

<BR>And inextinguishable rage; all Heav'n

<BR>Resounded, and had Earth bin then, all Earth

<BR>Had to her Center shook. What wonder? when

<BR>Millions of fierce encountring Angels fought

<BR>On either side, the least of whom could weild

<BR>These Elements, and arm him with the force

<BR>Of all thir Regions: how much more of Power

<BR>Armie against Armie numberless to raise

<BR>Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb,

<BR>Though not destroy, thir happie Native seat;

<BR>Had not th' Eternal King Omnipotent

<BR>From his strong hold of Heav'n high over-rul'd

<BR>And limited thir might; though numberd such

<BR>As each divided Legion might have seemd

<BR>A numerous Host, in strength each armed hand

<BR>A Legion; led in fight, yet Leader seemd

<BR>Each Warriour single as in Chief, expert

<BR>When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway

<BR>Of Battel, open when, and when to close

<BR>The ridges of grim Warr; no thought of flight,

<BR>None of retreat, no unbecoming deed

<BR>That argu'd fear; each on himself reli'd,

<BR>As onely in his arm the moment lay

<BR>Of victorie; deeds of eternal fame

<BR>Were don, but infinite: for wide was spred

<BR>That Warr and various; somtimes on firm ground

<BR>A standing fight, then soaring on main wing

<BR>Tormented all the Air; all Air seemd then

<BR>Conflicting Fire: long time in eeven scale

<BR>The Battel hung; till SATAN, who that day

<BR>Prodigious power had shewn, and met in Armes

<BR>No equal, raunging through the dire attack

<BR>Of fighting Seraphim confus'd, at length

<BR>Saw where the Sword of MICHAEL smote, and fell'd

<BR>Squadrons at once, with huge two-handed sway

<BR>Brandisht aloft the horrid edge came down

<BR>Wide wasting; such destruction to withstand

<BR>He hasted, and oppos'd the rockie Orb

<BR>Of tenfold Adamant, his ample Shield

<BR>A vast circumference: At his approach

<BR>The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toile

<BR>Surceas'd, and glad as hoping here to end

<BR>Intestine War in Heav'n, the arch foe subdu'd

<BR>Or Captive drag'd in Chains, with hostile frown

<BR>And visage all enflam'd first thus began.

<BR>Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt,

<BR>Unnam'd in Heav'n, now plenteous, as thou seest

<BR>These Acts of hateful strife, hateful to all,

<BR>Though heaviest by just measure on thy self

<BR>And thy adherents: how hast thou disturb'd

<BR>Heav'ns blessed peace, and into Nature brought

<BR>Miserie, uncreated till the crime

<BR>Of thy Rebellion? how hast thou instill'd

<BR>Thy malice into thousands, once upright

<BR>And faithful, now prov'd false. But think not here

<BR>To trouble Holy Rest; Heav'n casts thee out

<BR>From all her Confines. Heav'n the seat of bliss

<BR>Brooks not the works of violence and Warr.

<BR>Hence then, and evil go with thee along

<BR>Thy ofspring, to the place of evil, Hell,

<BR>Thou and thy wicked crew; there mingle broiles,

<BR>Ere this avenging Sword begin thy doome,

<BR>Or som more sudden vengeance wing'd from God

<BR>Precipitate thee with augmented paine.

<BR>So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus

<BR>The Adversarie. Nor think thou with wind

<BR>Of airie threats to aw whom yet with deeds

<BR>Thou canst not. Hast thou turnd the least of these

<BR>To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise

<BR>Unvanquisht, easier to transact with mee

<BR>That thou shouldst hope, imperious, &amp; with threats

<BR>To chase me hence? erre not that so shall end

<BR>The strife which thou call'st evil, but wee style

<BR>The strife of Glorie: which we mean to win,

<BR>Or turn this Heav'n it self into the Hell

<BR>Thou fablest, here however to dwell free,

<BR>If not to reign: mean while thy utmost force,

<BR>And join him nam'd ALMIGHTIE to thy aid,

<BR>I flie not, but have sought thee farr and nigh.

<BR>They ended parle, and both addrest for fight

<BR>Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue

<BR>Of Angels, can relate, or to what things

<BR>Liken on Earth conspicuous, that may lift

<BR>Human imagination to such highth

<BR>Of Godlike Power: for likest Gods they seemd,

<BR>Stood they or mov'd, in stature, motion, arms

<BR>Fit to decide the Empire of great Heav'n.

<BR>Now wav'd thir fierie Swords, and in the Aire

<BR>Made horrid Circles; two broad Suns thir Shields

<BR>Blaz'd opposite, while expectation stood

<BR>In horror; from each hand with speed retir'd

<BR>Where erst was thickest fight, th' Angelic throng,

<BR>And left large field, unsafe within the wind

<BR>Of such commotion, such as to set forth

<BR>Great things by small, If Natures concord broke,

<BR>Among the Constellations warr were sprung,

<BR>Two Planets rushing from aspect maligne

<BR>Of fiercest opposition in mid Skie,

<BR>Should combat, and thir jarring Sphears confound.

<BR>Together both with next to Almightie Arme,

<BR>Uplifted imminent one stroke they aim'd

<BR>That might determine, and not need repeate,

<BR>As not of power, at once; nor odds appeerd

<BR>In might or swift prevention; but the sword

<BR>Of MICHAEL from the Armorie of God

<BR>Was giv'n him temperd so, that neither keen

<BR>Nor solid might resist that edge: it met

<BR>The sword of SATAN with steep force to smite

<BR>Descending, and in half cut sheere, nor staid,

<BR>But with swift wheele reverse, deep entring shar'd

<BR>All his right side; then SATAN first knew pain,

<BR>And writh'd him to and fro convolv'd; so sore

<BR>The griding sword with discontinuous wound

<BR>Pass'd through him, but th' Ethereal substance clos'd

<BR>Not long divisible, and from the gash

<BR>A stream of Nectarous humor issuing flow'd

<BR>Sanguin, such as Celestial Spirits may bleed,

<BR>And all his Armour staind ere while so bright.

<BR>Forthwith on all sides to his aide was run

<BR>By Angels many and strong, who interpos'd

<BR>Defence, while others bore him on thir Shields

<BR>Back to his Chariot; where it stood retir'd

<BR>From off the files of warr; there they him laid

<BR>Gnashing for anguish and despite and shame

<BR>To find himself not matchless, and his pride

<BR>Humbl'd by such rebuke, so farr beneath

<BR>His confidence to equal God in power.

<BR>Yet soon he heal'd; for Spirits that live throughout

<BR>Vital in every part, not as frail man

<BR>In Entrailes, Heart or Head, Liver or Reines,

<BR>Cannot but by annihilating die;

<BR>Nor in thir liquid texture mortal wound

<BR>Receive, no more then can the fluid Aire:

<BR>All Heart they live, all Head, all Eye, all Eare,

<BR>All Intellect, all Sense, and as they please,

<BR>They Limb themselves, and colour, shape or size

<BR>Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare.

<BR>Mean while in other parts like deeds deservd

<BR>Memorial, where the might of GABRIEL fought,

<BR>And with fierce Ensignes pierc'd the deep array

<BR>Of MOLOC furious King, who him defi'd,

<BR>And at his Chariot wheeles to drag him bound

<BR>Threatn'd, nor from the Holie One of Heav'n

<BR>Refrein'd his tongue blasphemous; but anon

<BR>Down clov'n to the waste, with shatterd Armes

<BR>And uncouth paine fled bellowing. On each wing

<BR>URIEL and RAPHAEL his vaunting foe,

<BR>Though huge, and in a Rock of Diamond Armd,

<BR>Vanquish'd ADRAMELEC, and ASMADAI,

<BR>Two potent Thrones, that to be less then Gods

<BR>Disdain'd, but meaner thoughts learnd in thir flight,

<BR>Mangl'd with gastly wounds through Plate and Maile.

<BR>Nor stood unmindful ABDIEL to annoy

<BR>The Atheist crew, but with redoubl'd blow

<BR>ARIEL and ARIOC, and the violence

<BR>Of RAMIEL scorcht and blasted overthrew.

<BR>I might relate of thousands, and thir names

<BR>Eternize here on Earth; but those elect

<BR>Angels contented with thir fame in Heav'n

<BR>Seek not the praise of men: the other sort

<BR>In might though wondrous and in Acts of Warr,

<BR>Nor of Renown less eager, yet by doome

<BR>Canceld from Heav'n and sacred memorie,

<BR>Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell.

<BR>For strength from Truth divided and from Just,

<BR>Illaudable, naught merits but dispraise

<BR>And ignominie, yet to glorie aspires

<BR>Vain glorious, and through infamie seeks fame:

<BR>Therfore Eternal silence be thir doome.

<BR>And now thir mightiest quelld, the battel swerv'd,

<BR>With many an inrode gor'd; deformed rout

<BR>Enter'd, and foul disorder; all the ground

<BR>With shiverd armour strow'n, and on a heap

<BR>Chariot and Charioter lay overturnd

<BR>And fierie foaming Steeds; what stood, recoyld

<BR>Orewearied, through the faint Satanic Host

<BR>Defensive scarse, or with pale fear surpris'd,

<BR>Then first with fear surpris'd and sense of paine

<BR>Fled ignominious, to such evil brought

<BR>By sinne of disobedience, till that hour

<BR>Not liable to fear or flight or paine.

<BR>Far otherwise th' inviolable Saints

<BR>In Cubic Phalanx firm advanc't entire,

<BR>Invulnerable, impenitrably arm'd:

<BR>Such high advantages thir innocence

<BR>Gave them above thir foes, not to have sinnd,

<BR>Not to have disobei'd; in fight they stood

<BR>Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pain'd

<BR>By wound, though from thir place by violence mov'd.

<BR>Now Night her course began, and over Heav'n

<BR>Inducing darkness, grateful truce impos'd,

<BR>And silence on the odious dinn of Warr:

<BR>Under her Cloudie covert both retir'd,

<BR>Victor and Vanquisht: on the foughten field

<BR>MICHAEL and his Angels prevalent

<BR>Encamping, plac'd in Guard thir Watches round,

<BR>Cherubic waving fires: on th' other part

<BR>SATAN with his rebellious disappeerd,

<BR>Far in the dark dislodg'd, and void of rest,

<BR>His Potentates to Councel call'd by night;

<BR>And in the midst thus undismai'd began.

<BR>O now in danger tri'd, now known in Armes

<BR>Not to be overpowerd, Companions deare,

<BR>Found worthy not of Libertie alone,

<BR>Too mean pretense, but what we more affect,

<BR>Honour, Dominion, Glorie, and renowne,

<BR>Who have sustaind one day in doubtful fight,

<BR>(And if one day, why not Eternal dayes?)

<BR>What Heavens Lord had powerfullest to send

<BR>Against us from about his Throne, and judg'd

<BR>Sufficient to subdue us to his will,

<BR>But proves not so: then fallible, it seems,

<BR>Of future we may deem him, though till now

<BR>Omniscient thought. True is, less firmly arm'd,

<BR>Some disadvantage we endur'd and paine,

<BR>Till now not known, but known as soon contemnd,

<BR>Since now we find this our Empyreal forme

<BR>Incapable of mortal injurie

<BR>Imperishable, and though peirc'd with wound,

<BR>Soon closing, and by native vigour heal'd.

<BR>Of evil then so small as easie think

<BR>The remedie; perhaps more valid Armes,

<BR>Weapons more violent, when next we meet,

<BR>May serve to better us, and worse our foes,

<BR>Or equal what between us made the odds,

<BR>In Nature none: if other hidden cause

<BR>Left them Superiour, while we can preserve

<BR>Unhurt our mindes, and understanding sound,

<BR>Due search and consultation will disclose.

<BR>He sat; and in th' assembly next upstood

<BR>NISROC, of Principalities the prime;

<BR>As one he stood escap't from cruel fight,

<BR>Sore toild, his riv'n Armes to havoc hewn,

<BR>And cloudie in aspect thus answering spake.

<BR>Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free

<BR>Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard

<BR>For Gods, and too unequal work we find

<BR>Against unequal armes to fight in paine,

<BR>Against unpaind, impassive; from which evil

<BR>Ruin must needs ensue; for what availes

<BR>Valour or strength, though matchless, quelld with pain

<BR>Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands

<BR>Of Mightiest. Sense of pleasure we may well

<BR>Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine,

<BR>But live content, which is the calmest life:

<BR>But pain is perfet miserie, the worst

<BR>Of evils, and excessive, overturnes

<BR>All patience. He who therefore can invent

<BR>With what more forcible we may offend

<BR>Our yet unwounded Enemies, or arme

<BR>Our selves with like defence, to mee deserves

<BR>No less then for deliverance what we owe.

<BR>Whereto with look compos'd SATAN repli'd.

<BR>Not uninvented that, which thou aright

<BR>Beleivst so main to our success, I bring;

<BR>Which of us who beholds the bright surface

<BR>Of this Ethereous mould whereon we stand,

<BR>This continent of spacious Heav'n, adornd

<BR>With Plant, Fruit, Flour Ambrosial, Gemms &amp; Gold,

<BR>Whose Eye so superficially surveyes

<BR>These things, as not to mind from whence they grow

<BR>Deep under ground, materials dark and crude,

<BR>Of spiritous and fierie spume, till toucht

<BR>With Heav'ns ray, and temperd they shoot forth

<BR>So beauteous, op'ning to the ambient light.

<BR>These in thir dark Nativitie the Deep

<BR>Shall yeild us, pregnant with infernal flame,

<BR>Which into hallow Engins long and round

<BR>Thick-rammd, at th' other bore with touch of fire

<BR>Dilated and infuriate shall send forth

<BR>From far with thundring noise among our foes

<BR>Such implements of mischief as shall dash

<BR>To pieces, and orewhelm whatever stands

<BR>Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmd

<BR>The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt.

<BR>Nor long shall be our labour, yet ere dawne,

<BR>Effect shall end our wish. Mean while revive;

<BR>Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joind

<BR>Think nothing hard, much less to be despaird.

<BR>He ended, and his words thir drooping chere

<BR>Enlightn'd, and thir languisht hope reviv'd.

<BR>Th' invention all admir'd, and each, how hee

<BR>To be th' inventer miss'd, so easie it seemd

<BR>Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought

<BR>Impossible: yet haply of thy Race

<BR>In future dayes, if Malice should abound,

<BR>Some one intent on mischief, or inspir'd

<BR>With dev'lish machination might devise

<BR>Like instrument to plague the Sons of men

<BR>For sin, on warr and mutual slaughter bent.

<BR>Forthwith from Councel to the work they flew,

<BR>None arguing stood, innumerable hands

<BR>Were ready, in a moment up they turnd

<BR>Wide the Celestial soile, and saw beneath

<BR>Th' originals of Nature in thir crude

<BR>Conception; Sulphurous and Nitrous Foame

<BR>They found, they mingl'd, and with suttle Art,

<BR>Concocted and adusted they reduc'd

<BR>To blackest grain, and into store conveyd:

<BR>Part hidd'n veins diggd up (nor hath this Earth

<BR>Entrails unlike) of Mineral and Stone,

<BR>Whereof to found thir Engins and thir Balls

<BR>Of missive ruin; part incentive reed

<BR>Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire.

<BR>So all ere day spring, under conscious Night

<BR>Secret they finish'd, and in order set,

<BR>With silent circumspection unespi'd.

<BR>Now when fair Morn Orient in Heav'n appeerd

<BR>Up rose the Victor Angels, and to Arms

<BR>The matin Trumpet Sung: in Arms they stood

<BR>Of Golden Panoplie, refulgent Host,

<BR>Soon banded; others from the dawning Hills

<BR>Lookd round, and Scouts each Coast light-armed scoure,

<BR>Each quarter, to descrie the distant foe,

<BR>Where lodg'd, or whither fled, or if for fight,

<BR>In motion or in alt: him soon they met

<BR>Under spred Ensignes moving nigh, in slow

<BR>But firm Battalion; back with speediest Sail

<BR>ZEPHIEL, of Cherubim the swiftest wing,

<BR>Came flying, and in mid Aire aloud thus cri'd.

<BR>Arme, Warriours, Arme for fight, the foe at hand,

<BR>Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit

<BR>This day, fear not his flight; so thick a Cloud

<BR>He comes, and settl'd in his face I see

<BR>Sad resolution and secure: let each

<BR>His Adamantine coat gird well, and each

<BR>Fit well his Helme, gripe fast his orbed Shield,

<BR>Born eevn or high, for this day will pour down,

<BR>If I conjecture aught, no drizling showr,

<BR>But ratling storm of Arrows barbd with fire.

<BR>So warnd he them aware themselves, and soon

<BR>In order, quit of all impediment;

<BR>Instant without disturb they took Allarm,

<BR>And onward move Embattelld; when behold

<BR>Not distant far with heavie pace the Foe

<BR>Approaching gross and huge; in hollow Cube

<BR>Training his devilish Enginrie, impal'd

<BR>On every side with shaddowing Squadrons Deep,

<BR>To hide the fraud. At interview both stood

<BR>A while, but suddenly at head appeerd

<BR>SATAN: And thus was heard Commanding loud.

<BR>Vangard, to Right and Left the Front unfould;

<BR>That all may see who hate us, how we seek

<BR>Peace and composure, and with open brest

<BR>Stand readie to receive them, if they like

<BR>Our overture, and turn not back perverse;

<BR>But that I doubt, however witness Heaven,

<BR>Heav'n witness thou anon, while we discharge

<BR>Freely our part: yee who appointed stand

<BR>Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch

<BR>What we propound, and loud that all may hear.

<BR>So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce

<BR>Had ended; when to Right and Left the Front

<BR>Divided, and to either Flank retir'd.

<BR>Which to our eyes discoverd new and strange,

<BR>A triple-mounted row of Pillars laid

<BR>On Wheels (for like to Pillars most they seem'd

<BR>Or hollow'd bodies made of Oak or Firr

<BR>With branches lopt, in Wood or Mountain fell'd)

<BR>Brass, Iron, Stonie mould, had not thir mouthes

<BR>With hideous orifice gap't on us wide,

<BR>Portending hollow truce; at each behind

<BR>A Seraph stood, and in his hand a Reed

<BR>Stood waving tipt with fire; while we suspense,

<BR>Collected stood within our thoughts amus'd,

<BR>Not long, for sudden all at once thir Reeds

<BR>Put forth, and to a narrow vent appli'd

<BR>With nicest touch. Immediate in a flame,

<BR>But soon obscur'd with smoak, all Heav'n appeerd,

<BR>From those deep-throated Engins belcht, whose roar

<BR>Emboweld with outragious noise the Air,

<BR>And all her entrails tore, disgorging foule

<BR>Thir devillish glut, chaind Thunderbolts and Hail

<BR>Of Iron Globes, which on the Victor Host

<BR>Level'd, with such impetuous furie smote,

<BR>That whom they hit, none on thir feet might stand,

<BR>Though standing else as Rocks, but down they fell

<BR>By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rowl'd;

<BR>The sooner for thir Arms, unarm'd they might

<BR>Have easily as Spirits evaded swift

<BR>By quick contraction or remove; but now

<BR>Foule dissipation follow'd and forc't rout;

<BR>Nor serv'd it to relax thir serried files.

<BR>What should they do? if on they rusht, repulse

<BR>Repeated, and indecent overthrow

<BR>Doubl'd, would render them yet more despis'd,

<BR>And to thir foes a laughter; for in view

<BR>Stood rankt of Seraphim another row

<BR>In posture to displode thir second tire

<BR>Of Thunder: back defeated to return

<BR>They worse abhorr'd. SATAN beheld thir plight,

<BR>And to his Mates thus in derision call'd.

<BR>O Friends, why come not on these Victors proud?

<BR>Ere while they fierce were coming, and when wee,

<BR>To entertain them fair with open Front

<BR>And Brest, (what could we more?) propounded terms

<BR>Of composition, strait they chang'd thir minds,

<BR>Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell,

<BR>As they would dance, yet for a dance they seemd

<BR>Somwhat extravagant and wilde, perhaps

<BR>For joy of offerd peace: but I suppose

<BR>If our proposals once again were heard

<BR>We should compel them to a quick result.

<BR>To whom thus BELIAL in like gamesom mood.

<BR>Leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight,

<BR>Of hard contents, and full of force urg'd home,

<BR>Such as we might perceive amus'd them all,

<BR>And stumbl'd many, who receives them right,

<BR>Had need from head to foot well understand;

<BR>Not understood, this gift they have besides,

<BR>They shew us when our foes walk not upright.

<BR>So they among themselves in pleasant veine

<BR>Stood scoffing, highthn'd in thir thoughts beyond

<BR>All doubt of Victorie, eternal might

<BR>To match with thir inventions they presum'd

<BR>So easie, and of his Thunder made a scorn,

<BR>And all his Host derided, while they stood

<BR>A while in trouble; but they stood not long,

<BR>Rage prompted them at length, &amp; found them arms

<BR>Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose.

<BR>Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power

<BR>Which God hath in his mighty Angels plac'd)

<BR>Thir Arms away they threw, and to the Hills

<BR>(For Earth hath this variety from Heav'n

<BR>Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale)

<BR>Light as the Lightning glimps they ran, they flew,

<BR>From thir foundations loosning to and fro

<BR>They pluckt the seated Hills with all thir load,

<BR>Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggie tops

<BR>Up lifting bore them in thir hands: Amaze,

<BR>Be sure, and terrour seis'd the rebel Host,

<BR>When coming towards them so dread they saw

<BR>The bottom of the Mountains upward turn'd,

<BR>Till on those cursed Engins triple-row

<BR>They saw them whelmd, and all thir confidence

<BR>Under the weight of Mountains buried deep,

<BR>Themselves invaded next, and on thir heads

<BR>Main Promontories flung, which in the Air

<BR>Came shadowing, and opprest whole Legions arm'd,

<BR>Thir armor help'd thir harm, crush't in and brus'd

<BR>Into thir substance pent, which wrought them pain

<BR>Implacable, and many a dolorous groan,

<BR>Long strugling underneath, ere they could wind

<BR>Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light,

<BR>Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown.

<BR>The rest in imitation to like Armes

<BR>Betook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore;

<BR>So Hills amid the Air encounterd Hills

<BR>Hurl'd to and fro with jaculation dire,

<BR>That under ground they fought in dismal shade;

<BR>Infernal noise; Warr seem'd a civil Game

<BR>To this uproar; horrid confusion heapt

<BR>Upon confusion rose: and now all Heav'n

<BR>Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspred,

<BR>Had not th' Almightie Father where he sits

<BR>Shrin'd in his Sanctuarie of Heav'n secure,

<BR>Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen

<BR>This tumult, and permitted all, advis'd:

<BR>That his great purpose he might so fulfill,

<BR>To honour his Anointed Son aveng'd

<BR>Upon his enemies, and to declare

<BR>All power on him transferr'd: whence to his Son

<BR>Th' Assessor of his Throne he thus began.

<BR>Effulgence of my Glorie, Son belov'd,

<BR>Son in whose face invisible is beheld

<BR>Visibly, what by Deitie I am,

<BR>And in whose hand what by Decree I doe,

<BR>Second Omnipotence, two dayes are past,

<BR>Two dayes, as we compute the dayes of Heav'n,

<BR>Since MICHAEL and his Powers went forth to tame

<BR>These disobedient; sore hath been thir fight,

<BR>As likeliest was, when two such Foes met arm'd;

<BR>For to themselves I left them, and thou knowst,

<BR>Equal in their Creation they were form'd,

<BR>Save what sin hath impaird, which yet hath wrought

<BR>Insensibly, for I suspend thir doom;

<BR>Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last

<BR>Endless, and no solution will be found:

<BR>Warr wearied hath perform'd what Warr can do,

<BR>And to disorder'd rage let loose the reines,

<BR>With Mountains as with Weapons arm'd, which makes

<BR>Wild work in Heav'n, and dangerous to the maine.

<BR>Two dayes are therefore past, the third is thine;

<BR>For thee I have ordain'd it, and thus farr

<BR>Have sufferd, that the Glorie may be thine

<BR>Of ending this great Warr, since none but Thou

<BR>Can end it. Into thee such Vertue and Grace

<BR>Immense I have transfus'd, that all may know

<BR>In Heav'n and Hell thy Power above compare,

<BR>And this perverse Commotion governd thus,

<BR>To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir

<BR>Of all things, to be Heir and to be King

<BR>By Sacred Unction, thy deserved right.

<BR>Go then thou Mightiest in thy Fathers might,

<BR>Ascend my Chariot, guide the rapid Wheeles

<BR>That shake Heav'ns basis, bring forth all my Warr,

<BR>My Bow and Thunder, my Almightie Arms

<BR>Gird on, and Sword upon thy puissant Thigh;

<BR>Pursue these sons of Darkness, drive them out

<BR>From all Heav'ns bounds into the utter Deep:

<BR>There let them learn, as likes them, to despise

<BR>God and MESSIAH his anointed King.

<BR>He said, and on his Son with Rayes direct

<BR>Shon full, he all his Father full exprest

<BR>Ineffably into his face receiv'd,

<BR>And thus the filial Godhead answering spake.

<BR>O Father, O Supream of heav'nly Thrones,

<BR>First, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou alwayes seekst

<BR>To glorifie thy Son, I alwayes thee,

<BR>As is most just; this I my Glorie account,

<BR>My exaltation, and my whole delight,

<BR>That thou in me well pleas'd, declarst thy will

<BR>Fulfill'd, which to fulfil is all my bliss.

<BR>Scepter and Power, thy giving, I assume,

<BR>And gladlier shall resign, when in the end

<BR>Thou shalt be All in All, and I in thee

<BR>For ever, and in mee all whom thou lov'st:

<BR>But whom thou hat'st, I hate, and can put on

<BR>Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on,

<BR>Image of thee in all things; and shall soon,

<BR>Armd with thy might, rid heav'n of these rebell'd,

<BR>To thir prepar'd ill Mansion driven down

<BR>To chains of Darkness, and th' undying Worm,

<BR>That from thy just obedience could revolt,

<BR>Whom to obey is happiness entire.

<BR>Then shall thy Saints unmixt, and from th' impure

<BR>Farr separate, circling thy holy Mount

<BR>Unfained HALLELUIAHS to thee sing,

<BR>Hymns of high praise, and I among them chief.

<BR>So said, he o're his Scepter bowing, rose

<BR>From the right hand of Glorie where he sate,

<BR>And the third sacred Morn began to shine

<BR>Dawning through Heav'n: forth rush'd with whirlwind sound

<BR>The Chariot of Paternal Deitie,

<BR>Flashing thick flames, Wheele within Wheele undrawn,

<BR>It self instinct with Spirit, but convoyd

<BR>By four Cherubic shapes, four Faces each

<BR>Had wondrous, as with Starrs thir bodies all

<BR>And Wings were set with Eyes, with Eyes the Wheels

<BR>Of Beril, and careering Fires between;

<BR>Over thir heads a chrystal Firmament,

<BR>Whereon a Saphir Throne, inlaid with pure

<BR>Amber, and colours of the showrie Arch.

<BR>Hee in Celestial Panoplie all armd

<BR>Of radiant URIM, work divinely wrought,

<BR>Ascended, at his right hand Victorie

<BR>Sate Eagle-wing'd, beside him hung his Bow

<BR>And Quiver with three-bolted Thunder stor'd,

<BR>And from about him fierce Effusion rowld

<BR>Of smoak and bickering flame, and sparkles dire;

<BR>Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints,

<BR>He onward came, farr off his coming shon,

<BR>And twentie thousand (I thir number heard)

<BR>Chariots of God, half on each hand were seen:

<BR>Hee on the wings of Cherub rode sublime

<BR>On the Crystallin Skie, in Saphir Thron'd.

<BR>Illustrious farr and wide, but by his own

<BR>First seen, them unexpected joy surpriz'd,

<BR>When the great Ensign of MESSIAH blaz'd

<BR>Aloft by Angels born, his Sign in Heav'n:

<BR>Under whose Conduct MICHAEL soon reduc'd

<BR>His Armie, circumfus'd on either Wing,

<BR>Under thir Head imbodied all in one.

<BR>Before him Power Divine his way prepar'd;

<BR>At his command the uprooted Hills retir'd

<BR>Each to his place, they heard his voice and went

<BR>Obsequious, Heav'n his wonted face renewd,

<BR>And with fresh Flourets Hill and Valley smil'd.

<BR>This saw his hapless Foes, but stood obdur'd,

<BR>And to rebellious fight rallied thir Powers

<BR>Insensate, hope conceiving from despair.

<BR>In heav'nly Spirits could such perverseness dwell?

<BR>But to convince the proud what Signs availe,

<BR>Or Wonders move th' obdurate to relent?

<BR>They hard'nd more by what might most reclame,

<BR>Grieving to see his Glorie, at the sight

<BR>Took envie, and aspiring to his highth,

<BR>Stood reimbattell'd fierce, by force or fraud

<BR>Weening to prosper, and at length prevaile

<BR>Against God and MESSIAH, or to fall

<BR>In universal ruin last, and now

<BR>To final Battel drew, disdaining flight,

<BR>Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God

<BR>To all his Host on either hand thus spake.

<BR>Stand still in bright array ye Saints, here stand

<BR>Ye Angels arm'd, this day from Battel rest;

<BR>Faithful hath been your Warfare, and of God

<BR>Accepted, fearless in his righteous Cause,

<BR>And as ye have receivd, so have ye don

<BR>Invincibly; but of this cursed crew

<BR>The punishment to other hand belongs,

<BR>Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints;

<BR>Number to this dayes work is not ordain'd

<BR>Nor multitude, stand onely and behold

<BR>Gods indignation on these Godless pourd

<BR>By mee; not you but mee they have despis'd,

<BR>Yet envied; against mee is all thir rage,

<BR>Because the Father, t' whom in Heav'n supream

<BR>Kingdom and Power and Glorie appertains,

<BR>Hath honourd me according to his will.

<BR>Therefore to mee thir doom he hath assig'n'd;

<BR>That they may have thir wish, to trie with mee

<BR>In Battel which the stronger proves, they all,

<BR>Or I alone against them, since by strength

<BR>They measure all, of other excellence

<BR>Not emulous, nor care who them excells;

<BR>Nor other strife with them do I voutsafe.

<BR>So spake the Son, and into terrour chang'd

<BR>His count'nance too severe to be beheld

<BR>And full of wrauth bent on his Enemies.

<BR>At once the Four spred out thir Starrie wings

<BR>With dreadful shade contiguous, and the Orbes

<BR>Of his fierce Chariot rowld, as with the sound

<BR>Of torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host.

<BR>Hee on his impious Foes right onward drove,

<BR>Gloomie as Night; under his burning Wheeles

<BR>The stedfast Empyrean shook throughout,

<BR>All but the Throne it self of God. Full soon

<BR>Among them he arriv'd; in his right hand

<BR>Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent

<BR>Before him, such as in thir Soules infix'd

<BR>Plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost,

<BR>All courage; down thir idle weapons drop'd;

<BR>O're Shields and Helmes, and helmed heads he rode

<BR>Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate,

<BR>That wish'd the Mountains now might be again

<BR>Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire.

<BR>Nor less on either side tempestuous fell

<BR>His arrows, from the fourfold-visag'd Foure,

<BR>Distinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels,

<BR>Distinct alike with multitude of eyes,

<BR>One Spirit in them rul'd, and every eye

<BR>Glar'd lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire

<BR>Among th' accurst, that witherd all thir strength,

<BR>And of thir wonted vigour left them draind,

<BR>Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fall'n.

<BR>Yet half his strength he put not forth, but check'd

<BR>His Thunder in mid Volie, for he meant

<BR>Not to destroy, but root them out of Heav'n:

<BR>The overthrown he rais'd, and as a Heard

<BR>Of Goats or timerous flock together throngd

<BR>Drove them before him Thunder-struck, pursu'd

<BR>With terrors and with furies to the bounds

<BR>And Chrystall wall of Heav'n, which op'ning wide,

<BR>Rowld inward, and a spacious Gap disclos'd

<BR>Into the wastful Deep; the monstrous sight

<BR>Strook them with horror backward, but far worse

<BR>Urg'd them behind; headlong themselvs they threw

<BR>Down from the verge of Heav'n, Eternal wrauth

<BR>Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.

<BR>Hell heard th' unsufferable noise, Hell saw

<BR>Heav'n ruining from Heav'n and would have fled

<BR>Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep

<BR>Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound.

<BR>Nine dayes they fell; confounded CHAOS roard,

<BR>And felt tenfold confusion in thir fall

<BR>Through his wilde Anarchie, so huge a rout

<BR>Incumberd him with ruin: Hell at last

<BR>Yawning receavd them whole, and on them clos'd,

<BR>Hell thir fit habitation fraught with fire

<BR>Unquenchable, the house of woe and paine.

<BR>Disburd'nd Heav'n rejoic'd, and soon repaird

<BR>Her mural breach, returning whence it rowld.

<BR>Sole Victor from th' expulsion of his Foes

<BR>MESSIAH his triumphal Chariot turnd:

<BR>To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood

<BR>Eye witnesses of his Almightie Acts,

<BR>With Jubilie advanc'd; and as they went,

<BR>Shaded with branching Palme, each order bright,

<BR>Sung Triumph, and him sung Victorious King,

<BR>Son, Heire, and Lord, to him Dominion giv'n,

<BR>Worthiest to Reign: he celebrated rode

<BR>Triumphant through mid Heav'n, into the Courts

<BR>And Temple of his mightie Father Thron'd

<BR>On high; who into Glorie him receav'd,

<BR>Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss.

<BR>Thus measuring things in Heav'n by things on Earth

<BR>At thy request, and that thou maist beware

<BR>By what is past, to thee I have reveal'd

<BR>What might have else to human Race bin hid;

<BR>The discord which befel, and Warr in Heav'n

<BR>Among th' Angelic Powers, and the deep fall

<BR>Of those too high aspiring, who rebelld

<BR>With SATAN, hee who envies now thy state,

<BR>Who now is plotting how he may seduce

<BR>Thee also from obedience, that with him

<BR>Bereavd of happiness thou maist partake

<BR>His punishment, Eternal miserie;

<BR>Which would be all his solace and revenge,

<BR>As a despite don against the most High,

<BR>Thee once to gaine Companion of his woe.

<BR>But list'n not to his Temptations, warne

<BR>Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard

<BR>By terrible Example the reward

<BR>Of disobedience; firm they might have stood,

<BR>Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Descend from Heav'n URANIA, by that name

<BR>If rightly thou art call'd, whose Voice divine

<BR>Following, above th' OLYMPIAN Hill I soare,

<BR>Above the flight of PEGASEAN wing.

<BR>The meaning, not the Name I call: for thou

<BR>Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top

<BR>Of old OLYMPUS dwell'st, but Heav'nlie borne,

<BR>Before the Hills appeerd, or Fountain flow'd,

<BR>Thou with Eternal wisdom didst converse,

<BR>Wisdom thy Sister, and with her didst play

<BR>In presence of th' Almightie Father, pleas'd

<BR>With thy Celestial Song. Up led by thee

<BR>Into the Heav'n of Heav'ns I have presum'd,

<BR>An Earthlie Guest, and drawn Empyreal Aire,

<BR>Thy tempring; with like safetie guided down

<BR>Return me to my Native Element:

<BR>Least from this flying Steed unrein'd, (as once

<BR>BELLEROPHON, though from a lower Clime)

<BR>Dismounted, on th' ALEIAN Field I fall

<BR>Erroneous, there to wander and forlorne.

<BR>Half yet remaines unsung, but narrower bound

<BR>Within the visible Diurnal Spheare;

<BR>Standing on Earth, not rapt above the Pole,

<BR>More safe I Sing with mortal voice, unchang'd

<BR>To hoarce or mute, though fall'n on evil dayes,

<BR>On evil dayes though fall'n, and evil tongues;

<BR>In darkness, and with dangers compast rouud,

<BR>And solitude; yet not alone, while thou

<BR>Visit'st my slumbers Nightly, or when Morn

<BR>Purples the East: still govern thou my Song,

<BR>URANIA, and fit audience find, though few.

<BR>But drive farr off the barbarous dissonance

<BR>Of BACCHUS and his Revellers, the Race

<BR>Of that wilde Rout that tore the THRACIAN Bard

<BR>In RHODOPE, where Woods and Rocks had Eares

<BR>To rapture, till the savage clamor dround

<BR>Both Harp and Voice; nor could the Muse defend

<BR>Her Son. So fail not thou, who thee implores:

<BR>For thou art Heav'nlie, shee an empty dreame.

<BR>Say Goddess, what ensu'd when RAPHAEL,

<BR>The affable Arch-angel, had forewarn'd

<BR>ADAM by dire example to beware

<BR>Apostasie, by what befell in Heaven

<BR>To those Apostates, least the like befall

<BR>In Paradise to ADAM or his Race,

<BR>Charg'd not to touch the interdicted Tree,

<BR>If they transgress, and slight that sole command,

<BR>So easily obeyd amid the choice

<BR>Of all tasts else to please thir appetite,

<BR>Though wandring. He with his consorted EVE

<BR>The storie heard attentive, and was fill'd

<BR>With admiration, and deep Muse to heare

<BR>Of things so high and strange, things to thir thought

<BR>So unimaginable as hate in Heav'n,

<BR>And Warr so neer the Peace of God in bliss

<BR>With such confusion: but the evil soon

<BR>Driv'n back redounded as a flood on those

<BR>From whom it sprung, impossible to mix

<BR>With Blessedness. Whence ADAM soon repeal'd

<BR>The doubts that in his heart arose: and now

<BR>Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know

<BR>What neerer might concern him, how this World

<BR>Of Heav'n and Earth conspicuous first began,

<BR>When, and whereof created, for what cause,

<BR>What within EDEN or without was done

<BR>Before his memorie, as one whose drouth

<BR>Yet scarce allay'd still eyes the current streame,

<BR>Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites,

<BR>Proceeded thus to ask his Heav'nly Guest.

<BR>Great things, and full of wonder in our eares,

<BR>Farr differing from this World, thou hast reveal'd

<BR>Divine Interpreter, by favour sent

<BR>Down from the Empyrean to forewarne

<BR>Us timely of what might else have bin our loss,

<BR>Unknown, which human knowledg could not reach:

<BR>For which to the infinitly Good we owe

<BR>Immortal thanks, and his admonishment

<BR>Receave with solemne purpose to observe

<BR>Immutably his sovran will, the end

<BR>Of what we are. But since thou hast voutsaf't

<BR>Gently for our instruction to impart

<BR>Things above Earthly thought, which yet concernd

<BR>Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemd,

<BR>Deign to descend now lower, and relate

<BR>What may no less perhaps availe us known,

<BR>How first began this Heav'n which we behold

<BR>Distant so high, with moving Fires adornd

<BR>Innumerable, and this which yeelds or fills

<BR>All space, the ambient Aire wide interfus'd

<BR>Imbracing round this florid Earth, what cause

<BR>Mov'd the Creator in his holy Rest

<BR>Through all Eternitie so late to build

<BR>In CHAOS, and the work begun, how soon

<BR>Absolv'd, if unforbid thou maist unfould

<BR>What wee, not to explore the secrets aske

<BR>Of his Eternal Empire, but the more

<BR>To magnifie his works, the more we know.

<BR>And the great Light of Day yet wants to run

<BR>Much of his Race though steep, suspens in Heav'n

<BR>Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he heares,

<BR>And longer will delay to heare thee tell

<BR>His Generation, and the rising Birth

<BR>Of Nature from the unapparent Deep:

<BR>Or if the Starr of Eevning and the Moon

<BR>Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring

<BR>Silence, and Sleep listning to thee will watch,

<BR>Or we can bid his absence, till thy Song

<BR>End, and dismiss thee ere the Morning shine.

<BR>Thus ADAM his illustrous Guest besought:

<BR>And thus the Godlike Angel answerd milde.

<BR>This also thy request with caution askt

<BR>Obtaine: though to recount Almightie works

<BR>What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice,

<BR>Or heart of man suffice to comprehend?

<BR>Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve

<BR>To glorifie the Maker, and inferr

<BR>Thee also happier, shall not be withheld

<BR>Thy hearing, such Commission from above

<BR>I have receav'd, to answer thy desire

<BR>Of knowledge within bounds; beyond abstain

<BR>To ask, nor let thine own inventions hope

<BR>Things not reveal'd, which th' invisible King,

<BR>Onely Omniscient, hath supprest in Night,

<BR>To none communicable in Earth or Heaven:

<BR>Anough is left besides to search and know.

<BR>But Knowledge is as food, and needs no less

<BR>Her Temperance over Appetite, to know

<BR>In measure what the mind may well contain,

<BR>Oppresses else with Surfet, and soon turns

<BR>Wisdom to Folly, as Nourishment to Winde.

<BR>Know then, that after LUCIFER from Heav'n

<BR>(So call him, brighter once amidst the Host

<BR>Of Angels, then that Starr the Starrs among)

<BR>Fell with his flaming Legions through the Deep

<BR>Into his place, and the great Son returnd

<BR>Victorious with his Saints, th' Omnipotent

<BR>Eternal Father from his Throne beheld

<BR>Thir multitude, and to his Son thus spake.

<BR>At least our envious Foe hath fail'd, who thought

<BR>All like himself rebellious, by whose aid

<BR>This inaccessible high strength, the seat

<BR>Of Deitie supream, us dispossest,

<BR>He trusted to have seis'd, and into fraud

<BR>Drew many, whom thir place knows here no more;

<BR>Yet farr the greater part have kept, I see,

<BR>Thir station, Heav'n yet populous retaines

<BR>Number sufficient to possess her Realmes

<BR>Though wide, and this high Temple to frequent

<BR>With Ministeries due and solemn Rites:

<BR>But least his heart exalt him in the harme

<BR>Already done, to have dispeopl'd Heav'n,

<BR>My damage fondly deem'd, I can repaire

<BR>That detriment, if such it be to lose

<BR>Self-lost, and in a moment will create

<BR>Another World, out of one man a Race

<BR>Of men innumerable, there to dwell,

<BR>Not here, till by degrees of merit rais'd

<BR>They open to themselves at length the way

<BR>Up hither, under long obedience tri'd,

<BR>And Earth be chang'd to Heavn, &amp; Heav'n to Earth,

<BR>One Kingdom, Joy and Union without end.

<BR>Mean while inhabit laxe, ye Powers of Heav'n,

<BR>And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee

<BR>This I perform, speak thou, and be it don:

<BR>My overshadowing Spirit and might with thee

<BR>I send along, ride forth, and bid the Deep

<BR>Within appointed bounds be Heav'n and Earth,

<BR>Boundless the Deep, because I am who fill

<BR>Infinitude, nor vacuous the space.

<BR>Though I uncircumscrib'd my self retire,

<BR>And put not forth my goodness, which is free

<BR>To act or not, Necessitie and Chance

<BR>Approach not mee, and what I will is Fate.

<BR>So spake th' Almightie, and to what he spake

<BR>His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect.

<BR>Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift

<BR>Then time or motion, but to human ears

<BR>Cannot without process of speech be told,

<BR>So told as earthly notion can receave.

<BR>Great triumph and rejoycing was in Heav'n

<BR>When such was heard declar'd the Almightie's will;

<BR>Glorie they sung to the most High, good will

<BR>To future men, and in thir dwellings peace:

<BR>Glorie to him whose just avenging ire

<BR>Had driven out th' ungodly from his sight

<BR>And th' habitations of the just; to him

<BR>Glorie and praise, whose wisdom had ordain'd

<BR>Good out of evil to create, in stead

<BR>Of Spirits maligne a better Race to bring

<BR>Into thir vacant room, and thence diffuse

<BR>His good to Worlds and Ages infinite.

<BR>So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son

<BR>On his great Expedition now appeer'd,

<BR>Girt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crown'd

<BR>Of Majestie Divine, Sapience and Love

<BR>Immense, and all his Father in him shon.

<BR>About his Chariot numberless were pour'd

<BR>Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones,

<BR>And Vertues, winged Spirits, and Chariots wing'd,

<BR>From the Armoury of God, where stand of old

<BR>Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodg'd

<BR>Against a solemn day, harnest at hand,

<BR>Celestial Equipage; and now came forth

<BR>Spontaneous, for within them Spirit livd,

<BR>Attendant on thir Lord: Heav'n op'nd wide

<BR>Her ever during Gates, Harmonious sound

<BR>On golden Hinges moving, to let forth

<BR>The King of Glorie in his powerful Word

<BR>And Spirit coming to create new Worlds.

<BR>On heav'nly ground they stood, and from the shore

<BR>They view'd the vast immeasurable Abyss

<BR>Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde,

<BR>Up from the bottom turn'd by furious windes

<BR>And surging waves, as Mountains to assault

<BR>Heav'ns highth, and with the Center mix the Pole.

<BR>Silence, ye troubl'd waves, and thou Deep, peace,

<BR>Said then th' Omnific Word, your discord end:

<BR>Nor staid, but on the Wings of Cherubim

<BR>Uplifted, in Paternal Glorie rode

<BR>Farr into CHAOS, and the World unborn;

<BR>For CHAOS heard his voice: him all his Traine

<BR>Follow'd in bright procession to behold

<BR>Creation, and the wonders of his might.

<BR>Then staid the fervid Wheeles, and in his hand

<BR>He took the golden Compasses, prepar'd

<BR>In Gods Eternal store, to circumscribe

<BR>This Universe, and all created things:

<BR>One foot he center'd, and the other turn'd

<BR>Round through the vast profunditie obscure,

<BR>And said, thus farr extend, thus farr thy bounds,

<BR>This be thy just Circumference, O World.

<BR>Thus God the Heav'n created, thus the Earth,

<BR>Matter unform'd and void: Darkness profound

<BR>Cover'd th' Abyss: but on the watrie calme

<BR>His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspred,

<BR>And vital vertue infus'd, and vital warmth

<BR>Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purg'd

<BR>The black tartareous cold infernal dregs

<BR>Adverse to life: then founded, then conglob'd

<BR>Like things to like, the rest to several place

<BR>Disparted, and between spun out the Air,

<BR>And Earth self-ballanc't on her Center hung.

<BR>Let ther be Light, said God, and forthwith Light

<BR>Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure

<BR>Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East

<BR>To journie through the airie gloom began,

<BR>Sphear'd in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun

<BR>Was not; shee in a cloudie Tabernacle

<BR>Sojourn'd the while. God saw the Light was good;

<BR>And light from darkness by the Hemisphere

<BR>Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night

<BR>He nam'd. Thus was the first Day Eev'n and Morn:

<BR>Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung

<BR>By the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light

<BR>Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld;

<BR>Birth-day of Heav'n and Earth; with joy and shout

<BR>The hollow Universal Orb they fill'd,

<BR>And touch't thir Golden Harps, &amp; hymning prais'd

<BR>God and his works, Creatour him they sung,

<BR>Both when first Eevning was, and when first Morn.

<BR>Again, God said, let ther be Firmament

<BR>Amid the Waters, and let it divide

<BR>The Waters from the Waters: and God made

<BR>The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,

<BR>Transparent, Elemental Air, diffus'd

<BR>In circuit to the uttermost convex

<BR>Of this great Round: partition firm and sure,

<BR>The Waters underneath from those above

<BR>Dividing: for as Earth, so hee the World

<BR>Built on circumfluous Waters calme, in wide

<BR>Crystallin Ocean, and the loud misrule

<BR>Of CHAOS farr remov'd, least fierce extreames

<BR>Contiguous might distemper the whole frame:

<BR>And Heav'n he nam'd the Firmament: So Eev'n

<BR>And Morning CHORUS sung the second Day.

<BR>The Earth was form'd, but in the Womb as yet

<BR>Of Waters, Embryon immature involv'd,

<BR>Appeer'd not: over all the face of Earth

<BR>Main Ocean flow'd, not idle, but with warme

<BR>Prolific humour soft'ning all her Globe,

<BR>Fermented the great Mother to conceave,

<BR>Satiate with genial moisture, when God said

<BR>Be gather'd now ye Waters under Heav'n

<BR>Into one place, and let dry Land appeer.

<BR>Immediately the Mountains huge appeer

<BR>Emergent, and thir broad bare backs upheave

<BR>Into the Clouds, thir tops ascend the Skie:

<BR>So high as heav'd the tumid Hills, so low

<BR>Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,

<BR>Capacious bed of Waters: thither they

<BR>Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld

<BR>As drops on dust conglobing from the drie;

<BR>Part rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct,

<BR>For haste; such flight the great command impress'd

<BR>On the swift flouds: as Armies at the call

<BR>Of Trumpet (for of Armies thou hast heard)

<BR>Troop to thir Standard, so the watrie throng,

<BR>Wave rowling after Wave, where way they found,

<BR>If steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plaine,

<BR>Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill,

<BR>But they, or under ground, or circuit wide

<BR>With Serpent errour wandring, found thir way,

<BR>And on the washie Oose deep Channels wore;

<BR>Easie, e're God had bid the ground be drie,

<BR>All but within those banks, where Rivers now

<BR>Stream, and perpetual draw thir humid traine.

<BR>The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle

<BR>Of congregated Waters he call'd Seas:

<BR>And saw that it was good, and said, Let th' Earth

<BR>Put forth the verdant Grass, Herb yeilding Seed,

<BR>And Fruit Tree yeilding Fruit after her kind;

<BR>Whose Seed is in her self upon the Earth.

<BR>He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then

<BR>Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorn'd,

<BR>Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad

<BR>Her Universal Face with pleasant green,

<BR>Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden flour'd

<BR>Op'ning thir various colours, and made gay

<BR>Her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown,

<BR>Forth flourish't thick the clustring Vine, forth crept

<BR>The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed

<BR>Embattell'd in her field: add the humble Shrub,

<BR>And Bush with frizl'd hair implicit: last

<BR>Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spred

<BR>Thir branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm'd

<BR>Thir Blossoms: with high Woods the Hills were crownd,

<BR>With tufts the vallies &amp; each fountain side,

<BR>With borders long the Rivers. That Earth now

<BR>Seemd like to Heav'n, a seat where Gods might dwell,

<BR>Or wander with delight, and love to haunt

<BR>Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rain'd

<BR>Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground

<BR>None was, but from the Earth a dewie Mist

<BR>Went up and waterd all the ground, and each

<BR>Plant of the field, which e're it was in the Earth

<BR>God made, and every Herb, before it grew

<BR>On the green stemm; God saw that it was good:

<BR>So Eev'n and Morn recorded the Third Day.

<BR>Again th' Almightie spake: Let there be Lights

<BR>High in th' expanse of Heaven to divide

<BR>The Day from Night; and let them be for Signes,

<BR>For Seasons, and for Dayes, and circling Years,

<BR>And let them be for Lights as I ordaine

<BR>Thir Office in the Firmament of Heav'n

<BR>To give Light on the Earth; and it was so.

<BR>And God made two great Lights, great for thir use

<BR>To Man, the greater to have rule by Day,

<BR>The less by Night alterne: and made the Starrs,

<BR>And set them in the Firmament of Heav'n

<BR>To illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day

<BR>In thir vicissitude, and rule the Night,

<BR>And Light from Darkness to divide. God saw,

<BR>Surveying his great Work, that it was good:

<BR>For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun

<BR>A mightie Spheare he fram'd, unlightsom first,

<BR>Though of Ethereal Mould: then form'd the Moon

<BR>Globose, and everie magnitude of Starrs,

<BR>And sowd with Starrs the Heav'n thick as a field:

<BR>Of Light by farr the greater part he took,

<BR>Transplanted from her cloudie Shrine, and plac'd

<BR>In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive

<BR>And drink the liquid Light, firm to retaine

<BR>Her gather'd beams, great Palace now of Light.

<BR>Hither as to thir Fountain other Starrs

<BR>Repairing, in thir gold'n Urns draw Light,

<BR>And hence the Morning Planet guilds his horns;

<BR>By tincture or reflection they augment

<BR>Thir small peculiar, though from human sight

<BR>So farr remote, with diminution seen.

<BR>First in his East the glorious Lamp was seen,

<BR>Regent of Day, and all th' Horizon round

<BR>Invested with bright Rayes, jocond to run

<BR>His Longitude through Heav'ns high rode: the gray

<BR>Dawn, and the PLEIADES before him danc'd

<BR>Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon,

<BR>But opposite in leveld West was set

<BR>His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light

<BR>From him, for other light she needed none

<BR>In that aspect, and still that distance keepes

<BR>Till night, then in the East her turn she shines,

<BR>Revolvd on Heav'ns great Axle, and her Reign

<BR>With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds,

<BR>With thousand thousand Starres, that then appeer'd

<BR>Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adornd

<BR>With thir bright Luminaries that Set and Rose,

<BR>Glad Eevning &amp; glad Morn crownd the fourth day.

<BR>And God said, let the Waters generate

<BR>Reptil with Spawn abundant, living Soule:

<BR>And let Fowle flie above the Earth, with wings

<BR>Displayd on the op'n Firmament of Heav'n.

<BR>And God created the great Whales, and each

<BR>Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously

<BR>The waters generated by thir kindes,

<BR>And every Bird of wing after his kinde;

<BR>And saw that it was good, and bless'd them, saying,

<BR>Be fruitful, multiply, and in the Seas

<BR>And Lakes and running Streams the waters fill;

<BR>And let the Fowle be multiply'd on the Earth.

<BR>Forthwith the Sounds and Seas, each Creek &amp; Bay

<BR>With Frie innumerable swarme, and Shoales

<BR>Of Fish that with thir Finns and shining Scales

<BR>Glide under the green Wave, in Sculles that oft

<BR>Bank the mid Sea: part single or with mate

<BR>Graze the Sea weed thir pasture, &amp; through Groves

<BR>Of Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance

<BR>Show to the Sun thir wav'd coats dropt with Gold,

<BR>Or in thir Pearlie shells at ease, attend

<BR>Moist nutriment, or under Rocks thir food

<BR>In jointed Armour watch: on smooth the Seale,

<BR>And bended Dolphins play: part huge of bulk

<BR>Wallowing unweildie, enormous in thir Gate

<BR>Tempest the Ocean: there Leviathan

<BR>Hugest of living Creatures, on the Deep

<BR>Stretcht like a Promontorie sleeps or swimmes,

<BR>And seems a moving Land, and at his Gilles

<BR>Draws in, and at his Trunck spouts out a Sea.

<BR>Mean while the tepid Caves, and Fens and shoares

<BR>Thir Brood as numerous hatch, from the Egg that soon

<BR>Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclos'd

<BR>Thir callow young, but featherd soon and fledge

<BR>They summ'd thir Penns, and soaring th' air sublime

<BR>With clang despis'd the ground, under a cloud

<BR>In prospect; there the Eagle and the Stork

<BR>On Cliffs and Cedar tops thir Eyries build:

<BR>Part loosly wing the Region, part more wise

<BR>In common, rang'd in figure wedge thir way,

<BR>Intelligent of seasons, and set forth

<BR>Thir Aierie Caravan high over Sea's

<BR>Flying, and over Lands with mutual wing

<BR>Easing thir flight; so stears the prudent Crane

<BR>Her annual Voiage, born on Windes; the Aire

<BR>Floats, as they pass, fann'd with unnumber'd plumes:

<BR>From Branch to Branch the smaller Birds with song

<BR>Solac'd the Woods, and spred thir painted wings

<BR>Till Ev'n, nor then the solemn Nightingal

<BR>Ceas'd warbling, but all night tun'd her soft layes:

<BR>Others on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bath'd

<BR>Thir downie Brest; the Swan with Arched neck

<BR>Between her white wings mantling proudly, Rowes

<BR>Her state with Oarie feet: yet oft they quit

<BR>The Dank, and rising on stiff Pennons, towre

<BR>The mid Aereal Skie: Others on ground

<BR>Walk'd firm; the crested Cock whose clarion sounds

<BR>The silent hours, and th' other whose gay Traine

<BR>Adorns him, colour'd with the Florid hue

<BR>Of Rainbows and Starrie Eyes. The Waters thus

<BR>With Fish replenisht, and the Aire with Fowle,

<BR>Ev'ning and Morn solemniz'd the Fift day.

<BR>The Sixt, and of Creation last arose

<BR>With Eevning Harps and Mattin, when God said,

<BR>Let th' Earth bring forth Fowle living in her kinde,

<BR>Cattel and Creeping things, and Beast of the Earth,

<BR>Each in their kinde. The Earth obey'd, and strait

<BR>Op'ning her fertil Woomb teem'd at a Birth

<BR>Innumerous living Creatures, perfet formes,

<BR>Limb'd and full grown: out of the ground up-rose

<BR>As from his Laire the wilde Beast where he wonns

<BR>In Forrest wilde, in Thicket, Brake, or Den;

<BR>Among the Trees in Pairs they rose, they walk'd:

<BR>The Cattel in the Fields and Meddowes green:

<BR>Those rare and solitarie, these in flocks

<BR>Pasturing at once, and in broad Herds upsprung:

<BR>The grassie Clods now Calv'd, now half appeer'd

<BR>The Tawnie Lion, pawing to get free

<BR>His hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds,

<BR>And Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce,

<BR>The Libbard, and the Tyger, as the Moale

<BR>Rising, the crumbl'd Earth above them threw

<BR>In Hillocks; the swift Stag from under ground

<BR>Bore up his branching head: scarse from his mould

<BR>BEHEMOTH biggest born of Earth upheav'd

<BR>His vastness: Fleec't the Flocks and bleating rose,

<BR>As Plants: ambiguous between Sea and Land

<BR>The River Horse and scalie Crocodile.

<BR>At once came forth whatever creeps the ground,

<BR>Insect or Worme; those wav'd thir limber fans

<BR>For wings, and smallest Lineaments exact

<BR>In all the Liveries dect of Summers pride

<BR>With spots of Gold and Purple, azure and green:

<BR>These as a line thir long dimension drew,

<BR>Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all

<BR>Minims of Nature; some of Serpent kinde

<BR>Wondrous in length and corpulence involv'd

<BR>Thir Snakie foulds, and added wings. First crept

<BR>The Parsimonious Emmet, provident

<BR>Of future, in small room large heart enclos'd,

<BR>Pattern of just equalitie perhaps

<BR>Hereafter, join'd in her popular Tribes

<BR>Of Commonaltie: swarming next appeer'd

<BR>The Femal Bee that feeds her Husband Drone

<BR>Deliciously, and builds her waxen Cells

<BR>With Honey stor'd: the rest are numberless,

<BR>And thou thir Natures know'st, and gav'st them Names,

<BR>Needlest to thee repeaed; nor unknown

<BR>The Serpent suttl'st Beast of all the field,

<BR>Of huge extent somtimes, with brazen Eyes

<BR>And hairie Main terrific, though to thee

<BR>Not noxious, but obedient at thy call.

<BR>Now Heav'n in all her Glorie shon, and rowld

<BR>Her motions, as the great first-Movers hand

<BR>First wheeld thir course; Earth in her rich attire

<BR>Consummate lovly smil'd; Aire, Water, Earth,

<BR>By Fowl, Fish, Beast, was flown, was swum, was walkt

<BR>Frequent; and of the Sixt day yet remain'd;

<BR>There wanted yet the Master work, the end

<BR>Of all yet don; a Creature who not prone

<BR>And Brute as other Creatures, but endu'd

<BR>With Sanctitie of Reason, might erect

<BR>His Stature, and upright with Front serene

<BR>Govern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence

<BR>Magnanimous to correspond with Heav'n,

<BR>But grateful to acknowledge whence his good

<BR>Descends, thither with heart and voice and eyes

<BR>Directed in Devotion, to adore

<BR>And worship God Supream, who made him chief

<BR>Of all his works: therefore the Omnipotent

<BR>Eternal Father (For where is not hee

<BR>Present) thus to his Son audibly spake.

<BR>Let us make now Man in our image, Man

<BR>In our similitude, and let them rule

<BR>Over the Fish and Fowle of Sea and Aire,

<BR>Beast of the Field, and over all the Earth,

<BR>And every creeping thing that creeps the ground.

<BR>This said, he formd thee, ADAM, thee O Man

<BR>Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breath'd

<BR>The breath of Life; in his own Image hee

<BR>Created thee, in the Image of God

<BR>Express, and thou becam'st a living Soul.

<BR>Male he created thee, but thy consort

<BR>Femal for Race; then bless'd Mankinde, and said,

<BR>Be fruitful, multiplie, and fill the Earth,

<BR>Subdue it, and throughout Dominion hold

<BR>Over Fish of the Sea, and Fowle of the Aire,

<BR>And every living thing that moves on the Earth.

<BR>Wherever thus created, for no place

<BR>Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou know'st

<BR>He brought thee into this delicious Grove,

<BR>This Garden, planted with the Trees of God,

<BR>Delectable both to behold and taste;

<BR>And freely all thir pleasant fruit for food

<BR>Gave thee, all sorts are here that all th' Earth yeelds,

<BR>Varietie without end; but of the Tree

<BR>Which tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil,

<BR>Thou mai'st not; in the day thou eat'st, thou di'st;

<BR>Death is the penaltie impos'd, beware,

<BR>And govern well thy appetite, least sin

<BR>Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death.

<BR>Here finish'd hee, and all that he had made

<BR>View'd, and behold all was entirely good;

<BR>So Ev'n and Morn accomplish'd the Sixt day:

<BR>Yet not till the Creator from his work

<BR>Desisting, though unwearied, up returnd

<BR>Up to the Heav'n of Heav'ns his high abode,

<BR>Thence to behold this new created World

<BR>Th' addition of his Empire, how it shew'd

<BR>In prospect from his Throne, how good, how faire,

<BR>Answering his great Idea. Up he rode

<BR>Followd with acclamation and the sound

<BR>Symphonious of ten thousand Harpes that tun'd

<BR>Angelic harmonies: the Earth, the Aire

<BR>Resounded, (thou remember'st, for thou heardst)

<BR>The Heav'ns and all the Constellations rung,

<BR>The Planets in thir stations list'ning stood,

<BR>While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant.

<BR>Open, ye everlasting Gates, they sung,

<BR>Open, ye Heav'ns, your living dores; let in

<BR>The great Creator from his work returnd

<BR>Magnificent, his Six days work, a World;

<BR>Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deigne

<BR>To visit oft the dwellings of just Men

<BR>Delighted, and with frequent intercourse

<BR>Thither will send his winged Messengers

<BR>On errands of supernal Grace. So sung

<BR>The glorious Train ascending: He through Heav'n,

<BR>That open'd wide her blazing Portals, led

<BR>To Gods Eternal house direct the way,

<BR>A broad and ample rode, whose dust is Gold

<BR>And pavement Starrs, as Starrs to thee appeer,

<BR>Seen in the Galaxie, that Milkie way

<BR>Which nightly as a circling Zone thou seest

<BR>Pouderd with Starrs. And now on Earth the Seaventh

<BR>Eev'ning arose in EDEN, for the Sun

<BR>Was set, and twilight from the East came on,

<BR>Forerunning Night; when at the holy mount

<BR>Of Heav'ns high-seated top, th' Impereal Throne

<BR>Of Godhead, fixt for ever firm and sure,

<BR>The Filial Power arriv'd, and sate him down

<BR>With his great Father (for he also went

<BR>Invisible, yet staid (such priviledge

<BR>Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordain'd,

<BR>Author and end of all things, and from work

<BR>Now resting, bless'd and hallowd the Seav'nth day,

<BR>As resting on that day from all his work,

<BR>But not in silence holy kept; the Harp

<BR>Had work and rested not, the solemn Pipe,

<BR>And Dulcimer, all Organs of sweet stop,

<BR>All sounds on Fret by String or Golden Wire

<BR>Temper'd soft Tunings, intermixt with Voice

<BR>Choral or Unison: of incense Clouds

<BR>Fuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount.

<BR>Creation and the Six dayes acts they sung,

<BR>Great are thy works, JEHOVAH, infinite

<BR>Thy power; what thought can measure thee or tongue

<BR>Relate thee; greater now in thy return

<BR>Then from the Giant Angels; thee that day

<BR>Thy Thunders magnifi'd; but to create

<BR>Is greater then created to destroy.

<BR>Who can impair thee, mighty King, or bound

<BR>Thy Empire? easily the proud attempt

<BR>Of Spirits apostat and thir Counsels vaine

<BR>Thou hast repeld, while impiously they thought

<BR>Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw

<BR>The number of thy worshippers. Who seekes

<BR>To lessen thee, against his purpose serves

<BR>To manifest the more thy might: his evil

<BR>Thou usest, and from thence creat'st more good.

<BR>Witness this new-made World, another Heav'n

<BR>From Heaven Gate not farr, founded in view

<BR>On the cleer HYALINE, the Glassie Sea;

<BR>Of amplitude almost immense, with Starr's

<BR>Numerous, and every Starr perhaps a World

<BR>Of destind habitation; but thou know'st

<BR>Thir seasons: among these the seat of men,

<BR>Earth with her nether Ocean circumfus'd,

<BR>Thir pleasant dwelling place. Thrice happie men,

<BR>And sons of men, whom God hath thus advanc't,

<BR>Created in his Image, there to dwell

<BR>And worship him, and in reward to rule

<BR>Over his Works, on Earth, in Sea, or Air,

<BR>And multiply a Race of Worshippers

<BR>Holy and just: thrice happie if they know

<BR>Thir happiness, and persevere upright.

<BR>So sung they, and the Empyrean rung,

<BR>With HALLELUIAHS: Thus was Sabbath kept.

<BR>And thy request think now fulfill'd, that ask'd

<BR>How first this World and face of things began,

<BR>And what before thy memorie was don

<BR>From the beginning, that posteritie

<BR>Informd by thee might know; if else thou seekst

<BR>Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.

<BR>To whom thus ADAM gratefully repli'd.

<BR>What thanks sufficient, or what recompence

<BR>Equal have I to render thee, Divine

<BR>Hystorian, who thus largely hast allayd

<BR>The thirst I had of knowledge, and voutsaf't

<BR>This friendly condescention to relate

<BR>Things else by me unsearchable, now heard

<BR>VVith wonder, but delight, and, as is due,

<BR>With glorie attributed to the high

<BR>Creator; some thing yet of doubt remaines,

<BR>VVhich onely thy solution can resolve.

<BR>VVhen I behold this goodly Frame, this VVorld

<BR>Of Heav'n and Earth consisting, and compute,

<BR>Thir magnitudes, this Earth a spot, a graine,

<BR>An Atom, with the Firmament compar'd

<BR>And all her numberd Starrs, that seem to rowle

<BR>Spaces incomprehensible (for such

<BR>Thir distance argues and thir swift return

<BR>Diurnal) meerly to officiate light

<BR>Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot,

<BR>One day and night; in all thir vast survey

<BR>Useless besides, reasoning I oft admire,

<BR>How Nature wise and frugal could commit

<BR>Such disproportions, with superfluous hand

<BR>So many nobler Bodies to create,

<BR>Greater so manifold to this one use,

<BR>For aught appeers, and on thir Orbs impose

<BR>Such restless revolution day by day

<BR>Repeated, while the sedentarie Earth,

<BR>That better might with farr less compass move,

<BR>Serv'd by more noble then her self, attaines

<BR>Her end without least motion, and receaves,

<BR>As Tribute such a sumless journey brought

<BR>Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light;

<BR>Speed, to describe whose swiftness Number failes.

<BR>So spake our Sire, and by his count'nance seemd

<BR>Entring on studious thoughts abstruse, which EVE

<BR>Perceaving where she sat retir'd in sight,

<BR>With lowliness Majestic from her seat,

<BR>And Grace that won who saw to wish her stay,

<BR>Rose, and went forth among her Fruits and Flours,

<BR>To visit how they prosper'd, bud and bloom,

<BR>Her Nurserie; they at her coming sprung

<BR>And toucht by her fair tendance gladlier grew.

<BR>Yet went she not, as not with such discourse

<BR>Delighted, or not capable her eare

<BR>Of what was high: such pleasure she reserv'd,

<BR>ADAM relating, she sole Auditress;

<BR>Her Husband the Relater she preferr'd

<BR>Before the Angel, and of him to ask

<BR>Chose rather; hee, she knew would intermix

<BR>Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute

<BR>With conjugal Caresses, from his Lip

<BR>Not Words alone pleas'd her. O when meet now

<BR>Such pairs, in Love and mutual Honour joyn'd?

<BR>With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went;

<BR>Not unattended, for on her as Queen

<BR>A pomp of winning Graces waited still,

<BR>And from about her shot Darts of desire

<BR>Into all Eyes to wish her still in sight.

<BR>And RAPHAEL now to ADAM's doubt propos'd

<BR>Benevolent and facil thus repli'd.

<BR>To ask or search I blame thee not, for Heav'n

<BR>Is as the Book of God before thee set,

<BR>Wherein to read his wondrous Works, and learne

<BR>His Seasons, Hours, or Days, or Months, or Yeares:

<BR>This to attain, whether Heav'n move or Earth,

<BR>Imports not, if thou reck'n right, the rest

<BR>From Man or Angel the great Architect

<BR>Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge

<BR>His secrets to be scann'd by them who ought

<BR>Rather admire; or if they list to try

<BR>Conjecture, he his Fabric of the Heav'ns

<BR>Hath left to thir disputes, perhaps to move

<BR>His laughter at thir quaint Opinions wide

<BR>Hereafter, when they come to model Heav'n

<BR>And calculate the Starrs, how they will weild

<BR>The mightie frame, how build, unbuild, contrive

<BR>To save appeerances, how gird the Sphear

<BR>With Centric and Eccentric scribl'd o're,

<BR>Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb:

<BR>Alreadie by thy reasoning this I guess,

<BR>Who art to lead thy ofspring, and supposest

<BR>That Bodies bright and greater should not serve

<BR>The less not bright, nor Heav'n such journies run,

<BR>Earth sitting still, when she alone receaves

<BR>The benefit: consider first, that Great

<BR>Or Bright inferrs not Excellence: the Earth

<BR>Though, in comparison of Heav'n, so small,

<BR>Nor glistering, may of solid good containe

<BR>More plenty then the Sun that barren shines,

<BR>Whose vertue on it self workes no effect,

<BR>But in the fruitful Earth; there first receavd

<BR>His beams, unactive else, thir vigor find.

<BR>Yet not to Earth are those bright Luminaries

<BR>Officious, but to thee Earths habitant.

<BR>And for the Heav'ns wide Circuit, let it speak

<BR>The Makers high magnificence, who built

<BR>So spacious, and his Line stretcht out so farr;

<BR>That Man may know he dwells not in his own;

<BR>An Edifice too large for him to fill,

<BR>Lodg'd in a small partition, and the rest

<BR>Ordain'd for uses to his Lord best known.

<BR>The swiftness of those Circles attribute,

<BR>Though numberless, to his Omnipotence,

<BR>That to corporeal substances could adde

<BR>Speed almost Spiritual; mee thou thinkst not slow,

<BR>Who since the Morning hour set out from Heav'n

<BR>Where God resides, and ere mid-day arriv'd

<BR>In EDEN, distance inexpressible

<BR>By Numbers that have name. But this I urge,

<BR>Admitting Motion in the Heav'ns, to shew

<BR>Invalid that which thee to doubt it mov'd;

<BR>Not that I so affirm, though so it seem

<BR>To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth.

<BR>God to remove his wayes from human sense,

<BR>Plac'd Heav'n from Earth so farr, that earthly sight,

<BR>If it presume, might erre in things too high,

<BR>And no advantage gaine. What if the Sun

<BR>Be Center to the World, and other Starrs

<BR>By his attractive vertue and thir own

<BR>Incited, dance about him various rounds?

<BR>Thir wandring course now high, now low, then hid,

<BR>Progressive, retrograde, or standing still,

<BR>In six thou seest, and what if sev'nth to these

<BR>The Planet Earth, so stedfast though she seem,

<BR>Insensibly three different Motions move?

<BR>Which else to several Sphears thou must ascribe,

<BR>Mov'd contrarie with thwart obliquities,

<BR>Or save the Sun his labour, and that swift

<BR>Nocturnal and Diurnal rhomb suppos'd,

<BR>Invisible else above all Starrs, the Wheele

<BR>Of Day and Night; which needs not thy beleefe,

<BR>If Earth industrious of her self fetch Day

<BR>Travelling East, and with her part averse

<BR>From the Suns beam meet Night, her other part

<BR>Still luminous by his ray. What if that light

<BR>Sent from her through the wide transpicuous aire,

<BR>To the terrestrial Moon be as a Starr

<BR>Enlightning her by Day, as she by Night

<BR>This Earth? reciprocal, if Land be there,

<BR>Feilds and Inhabitants: Her spots thou seest

<BR>As Clouds, and Clouds may rain, and Rain produce

<BR>Fruits in her soft'nd Soile, for some to eate

<BR>Allotted there; and other Suns perhaps

<BR>With thir attendant Moons thou wilt descrie

<BR>Communicating Male and Femal Light,

<BR>Which two great Sexes animate the World,

<BR>Stor'd in each Orb perhaps with some that live.

<BR>For such vast room in Nature unpossest

<BR>By living Soule, desert and desolate,

<BR>Onely to shine, yet scarce to contribute

<BR>Each Orb a glimps of Light, conveyd so farr

<BR>Down to this habitable, which returnes

<BR>Light back to them, is obvious to dispute.

<BR>But whether thus these things, or whether not,

<BR>Whether the Sun predominant in Heav'n

<BR>Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun,

<BR>Hee from the East his flaming rode begin,

<BR>Or Shee from West her silent course advance

<BR>With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps

<BR>On her soft Axle, while she paces Eev'n,

<BR>And bears thee soft with the smooth Air along,

<BR>Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid,

<BR>Leave them to God above, him serve and feare;

<BR>Of other Creatures, as him pleases best,

<BR>Wherever plac't, let him dispose: joy thou

<BR>In what he gives to thee, this Paradise

<BR>And thy faire EVE; Heav'n is for thee too high

<BR>To know what passes there; be lowlie wise:

<BR>Think onely what concernes thee and thy being;

<BR>Dream not of other Worlds, what Creatures there

<BR>Live, in what state, condition or degree,

<BR>Contented that thus farr hath been reveal'd

<BR>Not of Earth onely but of highest Heav'n.

<BR>To whom thus ADAM cleerd of doubt, repli'd.

<BR>How fully hast thou satisfi'd mee, pure

<BR>Intelligence of Heav'n, Angel serene,

<BR>And freed from intricacies, taught to live,

<BR>The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts

<BR>To interrupt the sweet of Life, from which

<BR>God hath bid dwell farr off all anxious cares,

<BR>And not molest us, unless we our selves

<BR>Seek them with wandring thoughts, and notions vaine.

<BR>But apt the Mind or Fancie is to roave

<BR>Uncheckt, and of her roaving is no end;

<BR>Till warn'd, or by experience taught, she learne,

<BR>That not to know at large of things remote

<BR>From use, obscure and suttle, but to know

<BR>That which before us lies in daily life,

<BR>Is the prime Wisdom, what is more, is fume,

<BR>Or emptiness, or fond impertinence,

<BR>And renders us in things that most concerne

<BR>Unpractis'd, unprepar'd, and still to seek.

<BR>Therefore from this high pitch let us descend

<BR>A lower flight, and speak of things at hand

<BR>Useful, whence haply mention may arise

<BR>Of somthing not unseasonable to ask

<BR>By sufferance, and thy wonted favour deign'd.

<BR>Thee I have heard relating what was don

<BR>Ere my remembrance: now hear mee relate

<BR>My Storie, which perhaps thou hast not heard;

<BR>And Day is yet not spent; till then thou seest

<BR>How suttly to detaine thee I devise,

<BR>Inviting thee to hear while I relate,

<BR>Fond, were it not in hope of thy reply:

<BR>For while I sit with thee, I seem in Heav'n,

<BR>And sweeter thy discourse is to my eare

<BR>Then Fruits of Palm-tree pleasantest to thirst

<BR>And hunger both, from labour, at the houre

<BR>Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill,

<BR>Though pleasant, but thy words with Grace Divine

<BR>Imbu'd, bring to thir sweetness no satietie.

<BR>To whom thus RAPHAEL answer'd heav'nly meek.

<BR>Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men,

<BR>Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee

<BR>Abundantly his gifts hath also pour'd,

<BR>Inward and outward both, his image faire:

<BR>Speaking or mute all comliness and grace

<BR>Attends thee, and each word, each motion formes.

<BR>Nor less think wee in Heav'n of thee on Earth

<BR>Then of our fellow servant, and inquire

<BR>Gladly into the wayes of God with Man:

<BR>For God we see hath honour'd thee, and set

<BR>On Man his equal Love: say therefore on;

<BR>For I that Day was absent, as befell,

<BR>Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure,

<BR>Farr on excursion toward the Gates of Hell;

<BR>Squar'd in full Legion (such command we had)

<BR>To see that none thence issu'd forth a spie,

<BR>Or enemie, while God was in his work,

<BR>Least hee incenst at such eruption bold,

<BR>Destruction with Creation might have mixt.

<BR>Not that they durst without his leave attempt,

<BR>But us he sends upon his high behests

<BR>For state, as Sovran King, and to enure

<BR>Our prompt obedience. Fast we found, fast shut

<BR>The dismal Gates, and barricado'd strong;

<BR>But long ere our approaching heard within

<BR>Noise, other then the sound of Dance or Song,

<BR>Torment, and lowd lament, and furious rage.

<BR>Glad we return'd up to the coasts of Light

<BR>Ere Sabbath Eev'ning: so we had in charge.

<BR>But thy relation now; for I attend,

<BR>Pleas'd with thy words no less then thou with mine.

<BR>So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire.

<BR>For Man to tell how human Life began

<BR>Is hard; for who himself beginning knew?

<BR>Desire with thee still longer to converse

<BR>Induc'd me. As new wak't from soundest sleep

<BR>Soft on the flourie herb I found me laid

<BR>In Balmie Sweat, which with his Beames the Sun

<BR>Soon dri'd, and on the reaking moisture fed.

<BR>Strait toward Heav'n my wondring Eyes I turnd,

<BR>And gaz'd a while the ample Skie, till rais'd

<BR>By quick instinctive motion up I sprung,

<BR>As thitherward endevoring, and upright

<BR>Stood on my feet; about me round I saw

<BR>Hill, Dale, and shadie Woods, and sunnie Plaines,

<BR>And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams; by these,

<BR>Creatures that livd, and movd, and walk'd, or flew,

<BR>Birds on the branches warbling; all things smil'd,

<BR>With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflow'd.

<BR>My self I then perus'd, and Limb by Limb

<BR>Survey'd, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran

<BR>With supple joints, as lively vigour led:

<BR>But who I was, or where, or from what cause,

<BR>Knew not; to speak I tri'd, and forthwith spake,

<BR>My Tongue obey'd and readily could name

<BR>What e're I saw. Thou Sun, said I, faire Light,

<BR>And thou enlight'nd Earth, so fresh and gay,

<BR>Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines,

<BR>And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell,

<BR>Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here?

<BR>Not of my self; by some great Maker then,

<BR>In goodness and in power praeeminent;

<BR>Tell me, how may I know him, how adore,

<BR>From whom I have that thus I move and live,

<BR>And feel that I am happier then I know.

<BR>While thus I call'd, and stray'd I knew not whither,

<BR>From where I first drew Aire, and first beheld

<BR>This happie Light, when answer none return'd,

<BR>On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours

<BR>Pensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep

<BR>First found me, and with soft oppression seis'd

<BR>My droused sense, untroubl'd, though I thought

<BR>I then was passing to my former state

<BR>Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve:

<BR>When suddenly stood at my Head a dream,

<BR>Whose inward apparition gently mov'd

<BR>My Fancy to believe I yet had being,

<BR>And livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine,

<BR>And said, thy Mansion wants thee, ADAM, rise,

<BR>First Man, of Men innumerable ordain'd

<BR>First Father, call'd by thee I come thy Guide

<BR>To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepar'd.

<BR>So saying, by the hand he took me rais'd,

<BR>And over Fields and Waters, as in Aire

<BR>Smooth sliding without step, last led me up

<BR>A woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine,

<BR>A Circuit wide, enclos'd, with goodliest Trees

<BR>Planted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw

<BR>Of Earth before scarse pleasant seemd. Each Tree

<BR>Load'n with fairest Fruit, that hung to the Eye

<BR>Tempting, stirr'd in me sudden appetite

<BR>To pluck and eate; whereat I wak'd, and found

<BR>Before mine Eyes all real, as the dream

<BR>Had lively shadowd: Here had new begun

<BR>My wandring, had not hee who was my Guide

<BR>Up hither, from among the Trees appeer'd,

<BR>Presence Divine. Rejoycing, but with aw

<BR>In adoration at his feet I fell

<BR>Submiss: he rear'd me, &amp; Whom thou soughtst I am,

<BR>Said mildely, Author of all this thou seest

<BR>Above, or round about thee or beneath.

<BR>This Paradise I give thee, count it thine

<BR>To Till and keep, and of the Fruit to eate:

<BR>Of every Tree that in the Garden growes

<BR>Eate freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth:

<BR>But of the Tree whose operation brings

<BR>Knowledg of good and ill, which I have set

<BR>The Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith,

<BR>Amid the Garden by the Tree of Life,

<BR>Remember what I warne thee, shun to taste,

<BR>And shun the bitter consequence: for know,

<BR>The day thou eat'st thereof, my sole command

<BR>Transgrest, inevitably thou shalt dye;

<BR>From that day mortal, and this happie State

<BR>Shalt loose, expell'd from hence into a World

<BR>Of woe and sorrow. Sternly he pronounc'd

<BR>The rigid interdiction, which resounds

<BR>Yet dreadful in mine eare, though in my choice

<BR>Not to incur; but soon his cleer aspect

<BR>Return'd and gratious purpose thus renew'd.

<BR>Not onely these fair bounds, but all the Earth

<BR>To thee and to thy Race I give; as Lords

<BR>Possess it, and all things that therein live,

<BR>Or live in Sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and Fowle.

<BR>In signe whereof each Bird and Beast behold

<BR>After thir kindes; I bring them to receave

<BR>From thee thir Names, and pay thee fealtie

<BR>With low subjection; understand the same

<BR>Of Fish within thir watry residence,

<BR>Not hither summond, since they cannot change

<BR>Thir Element to draw the thinner Aire.

<BR>As thus he spake, each Bird and Beast behold

<BR>Approaching two and two, These cowring low

<BR>With blandishment, each Bird stoop'd on his wing.

<BR>I nam'd them, as they pass'd, and understood

<BR>Thir Nature, with such knowledg God endu'd

<BR>My sudden apprehension: but in these

<BR>I found not what me thought I wanted still;

<BR>And to the Heav'nly vision thus presum'd.

<BR>O by what Name, for thou above all these,

<BR>Above mankinde, or aught then mankinde higher,

<BR>Surpassest farr my naming, how may I

<BR>Adore thee, Author of this Universe,

<BR>And all this good to man, for whose well being

<BR>So amply, and with hands so liberal

<BR>Thou hast provided all things: but with mee

<BR>I see not who partakes. In solitude

<BR>What happiness, who can enjoy alone,

<BR>Or all enjoying, what contentment find?

<BR>Thus I presumptuous; and the vision bright,

<BR>As with a smile more bright'nd, thus repli'd.

<BR>What call'st thou solitude, is not the Earth

<BR>With various living creatures, and the Aire

<BR>Replenisht, and all these at thy command

<BR>To come and play before thee, know'st thou not

<BR>Thir language and thir wayes, they also know,

<BR>And reason not contemptibly; with these

<BR>Find pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large.

<BR>So spake the Universal Lord, and seem'd

<BR>So ordering. I with leave of speech implor'd,

<BR>And humble deprecation thus repli'd.

<BR>Let not my words offend thee, Heav'nly Power,

<BR>My Maker, be propitious while I speak.

<BR>Hast thou not made me here thy substitute,

<BR>And these inferiour farr beneath me set?

<BR>Among unequals what societie

<BR>Can sort, what harmonie or true delight?

<BR>Which must be mutual, in proportion due

<BR>Giv'n and receiv'd; but in disparitie

<BR>The one intense, the other still remiss

<BR>Cannot well suite with either, but soon prove

<BR>Tedious alike: Of fellowship I speak

<BR>Such as I seek, fit to participate

<BR>All rational delight, wherein the brute

<BR>Cannot be human consort; they rejoyce

<BR>Each with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness;

<BR>So fitly them in pairs thou hast combin'd;

<BR>Much less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with Fowle

<BR>So well converse, nor with the Ox the Ape;

<BR>Wors then can Man with Beast, and least of all.

<BR>Whereto th' Almighty answer'd, not displeas'd.

<BR>A nice and suttle happiness I see

<BR>Thou to thy self proposest, in the choice

<BR>Of thy Associates, ADAM, and wilt taste

<BR>No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitarie.

<BR>What thinkst thou then of mee, and this my State,

<BR>Seem I to thee sufficiently possest

<BR>Of happiness, or not? who am alone

<BR>From all Eternitie, for none I know

<BR>Second to mee or like, equal much less.

<BR>How have I then with whom to hold converse

<BR>Save with the Creatures which I made, and those

<BR>To me inferiour, infinite descents

<BR>Beneath what other Creatures are to thee?

<BR>He ceas'd, I lowly answer'd. To attaine

<BR>The highth and depth of thy Eternal wayes

<BR>All human thoughts come short, Supream of things;

<BR>Thou in thy self art perfet, and in thee

<BR>Is no deficience found; not so is Man,

<BR>But in degree, the cause of his desire

<BR>By conversation with his like to help,

<BR>Or solace his defects. No need that thou

<BR>Shouldst propagat, already infinite;

<BR>And through all numbers absolute, though One;

<BR>But Man by number is to manifest

<BR>His single imperfection, and beget

<BR>Like of his like, his Image multipli'd,

<BR>In unitie defective, which requires

<BR>Collateral love, and deerest amitie.

<BR>Thou in thy secresie although alone,

<BR>Best with thy self accompanied, seek'st not

<BR>Social communication, yet so pleas'd,

<BR>Canst raise thy Creature to what highth thou wilt

<BR>Of Union or Communion, deifi'd;

<BR>I by conversing cannot these erect

<BR>From prone, nor in thir wayes complacence find.

<BR>Thus I embold'nd spake, and freedom us'd

<BR>Permissive, and acceptance found, which gain'd

<BR>This answer from the gratious voice Divine.

<BR>Thus farr to try thee, ADAM, I was pleas'd,

<BR>And finde thee knowing not of Beasts alone,

<BR>Which thou hast rightly nam'd, but of thy self,

<BR>Expressing well the spirit within thee free,

<BR>My Image, not imparted to the Brute,

<BR>Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee

<BR>Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike,

<BR>And be so minded still; I, ere thou spak'st,

<BR>Knew it not good for Man to be alone,

<BR>And no such companie as then thou saw'st

<BR>Intended thee, for trial onely brought,

<BR>To see how thou could'st judge of fit and meet:

<BR>What next I bring shall please thee, be assur'd,

<BR>Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self,

<BR>Thy wish, exactly to thy hearts desire.

<BR>Hee ended, or I heard no more, for now

<BR>My earthly by his Heav'nly overpowerd,

<BR>Which it had long stood under, streind to the highth

<BR>In that celestial Colloquie sublime,

<BR>As with an object that excels the sense,

<BR>Dazl'd and spent, sunk down, and sought repair

<BR>Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, call'd

<BR>By Nature as in aide, and clos'd mine eyes.

<BR>Mine eyes he clos'd, but op'n left the Cell

<BR>Of Fancie my internal sight, by which

<BR>Abstract as in a transe methought I saw,

<BR>Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape

<BR>Still glorious before whom awake I stood;

<BR>Who stooping op'nd my left side, and took

<BR>From thence a Rib, with cordial spirits warme,

<BR>And Life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound,

<BR>But suddenly with flesh fill'd up &amp; heal'd:

<BR>The Rib he formd and fashond with his hands;

<BR>Under his forming hands a Creature grew,

<BR>Manlike, but different sex, so lovly faire,

<BR>That what seemd fair in all the World, seemd now

<BR>Mean, or in her summd up, in her containd

<BR>And in her looks, which from that time infus'd

<BR>Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before,

<BR>And into all things from her Aire inspir'd

<BR>The spirit of love and amorous delight.

<BR>She disappeerd, and left me dark, I wak'd

<BR>To find her, or for ever to deplore

<BR>Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure:

<BR>When out of hope, behold her, not farr off,

<BR>Such as I saw her in my dream, adornd

<BR>With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow

<BR>To make her amiable: On she came,

<BR>Led by her Heav'nly Maker, though unseen,

<BR>And guided by his voice, nor uninformd

<BR>Of nuptial Sanctitie and marriage Rites:

<BR>Grace was in all her steps, Heav'n in her Eye,

<BR>In every gesture dignitie and love.

<BR>I overjoyd could not forbear aloud.

<BR>This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfill'd

<BR>Thy words, Creator bounteous and benigne,

<BR>Giver of all things faire, but fairest this

<BR>Of all thy gifts, nor enviest. I now see

<BR>Bone of my Bone, Flesh of my Flesh, my Self

<BR>Before me; Woman is her Name, of Man

<BR>Extracted; for this cause he shall forgoe

<BR>Father and Mother, and to his Wife adhere;

<BR>And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soule.

<BR>She heard me thus, and though divinely brought,

<BR>Yet Innocence and Virgin Modestie,

<BR>Her vertue and the conscience of her worth,

<BR>That would be woo'd, and not unsought be won,

<BR>Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retir'd,

<BR>The more desirable, or to say all,

<BR>Nature her self, though pure of sinful thought,

<BR>Wrought in her so, that seeing me, she turn'd;

<BR>I follow'd her, she what was Honour knew,

<BR>And with obsequious Majestie approv'd

<BR>My pleaded reason. To the Nuptial Bowre

<BR>I led her blushing like the Morn: all Heav'n,

<BR>And happie Constellations on that houre

<BR>Shed thir selectest influence; the Earth

<BR>Gave sign of gratulation, and each Hill;

<BR>Joyous the Birds; fresh Gales and gentle Aires

<BR>Whisper'd it to the Woods, and from thir wings

<BR>Flung Rose, flung Odours from the spicie Shrub,

<BR>Disporting, till the amorous Bird of Night

<BR>Sung Spousal, and bid haste the Eevning Starr

<BR>On his Hill top, to light the bridal Lamp.

<BR>Thus I have told thee all my State, and brought

<BR>My Storie to the sum of earthly bliss

<BR>Which I enjoy, and must confess to find

<BR>In all things else delight indeed, but such

<BR>As us'd or not, works in the mind no change,

<BR>Nor vehement desire, these delicacies

<BR>I mean of Taste, Sight, Smell, Herbs, Fruits, &amp; Flours,

<BR>Walks, and the melodie of Birds; but here

<BR>Farr otherwise, transported I behold,

<BR>Transported touch; here passion first I felt,

<BR>Commotion strange, in all enjoyments else

<BR>Superiour and unmov'd, here onely weake

<BR>Against the charm of Beauties powerful glance.

<BR>Or Nature faild in mee, and left some part

<BR>Not proof enough such Object to sustain,

<BR>Or from my side subducting, took perhaps

<BR>More then enough; at least on her bestow'd

<BR>Too much of Ornament, in outward shew

<BR>Elaborate, of inward less exact.

<BR>For well I understand in the prime end

<BR>Of Nature her th' inferiour, in the mind

<BR>And inward Faculties, which most excell,

<BR>In outward also her resembling less

<BR>His Image who made both, and less expressing

<BR>The character of that Dominion giv'n

<BR>O're other Creatures; yet when I approach

<BR>Her loveliness, so absolute she seems

<BR>And in her self compleat, so well to know

<BR>Her own, that what she wills to do or say,

<BR>Seems wisest, vertuousest, discreetest, best;

<BR>All higher knowledge in her presence falls

<BR>Degraded, Wisdom in discourse with her

<BR>Looses discount'nanc't, and like folly shewes;

<BR>Authoritie and Reason on her waite,

<BR>As one intended first, not after made

<BR>Occasionally; and to consummate all,

<BR>Greatness of mind and nobleness thir seat

<BR>Build in her loveliest, and create an awe

<BR>About her, as a guard Angelic plac't.

<BR>To whom the Angel with contracted brow.

<BR>Accuse not Nature, she hath don her part;

<BR>Do thou but thine, and be not diffident

<BR>Of Wisdom, she deserts thee not, if thou

<BR>Dismiss not her, when most thou needst her nigh,

<BR>By attributing overmuch to things

<BR>Less excellent, as thou thy self perceav'st.

<BR>For what admir'st thou, what transports thee so,

<BR>An outside? fair no doubt, and worthy well

<BR>Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love,

<BR>Not thy subjection: weigh with her thy self;

<BR>Then value: Oft times nothing profits more

<BR>Then self-esteem, grounded on just and right

<BR>Well manag'd; of that skill the more thou know'st,

<BR>The more she will acknowledge thee her Head,

<BR>And to realities yeild all her shows;

<BR>Made so adorn for thy delight the more,

<BR>So awful, that with honour thou maist love

<BR>Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise.

<BR>But if the sense of touch whereby mankind

<BR>Is propagated seem such dear delight

<BR>Beyond all other, think the same voutsaf't

<BR>To Cattel and each Beast; which would not be

<BR>To them made common &amp; divulg'd, if aught

<BR>Therein enjoy'd were worthy to subdue

<BR>The Soule of Man, or passion in him move.

<BR>What higher in her societie thou findst

<BR>Attractive, human, rational, love still;

<BR>In loving thou dost well, in passion not,

<BR>Wherein true Love consists not; love refines

<BR>The thoughts, and heart enlarges, hath his seat

<BR>In Reason, and is judicious, is the scale

<BR>By which to heav'nly Love thou maist ascend,

<BR>Not sunk in carnal pleasure, for which cause

<BR>Among the Beasts no Mate for thee was found.

<BR>To whom thus half abash't ADAM repli'd.

<BR>Neither her out-side formd so fair, nor aught

<BR>In procreation common to all kindes

<BR>(Though higher of the genial Bed by far,

<BR>And with mysterious reverence I deem)

<BR>So much delights me, as those graceful acts,

<BR>Those thousand decencies that daily flow

<BR>From all her words and actions, mixt with Love

<BR>And sweet compliance, which declare unfeign'd

<BR>Union of Mind, or in us both one Soule;

<BR>Harmonie to behold in wedded pair

<BR>More grateful then harmonious sound to the eare.

<BR>Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose

<BR>What inward thence I feel, not therefore foild,

<BR>Who meet with various objects, from the sense

<BR>Variously representing; yet still free

<BR>Approve the best, and follow what I approve.

<BR>To love thou blam'st me not, for love thou saist

<BR>Leads up to Heav'n, is both the way and guide;

<BR>Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask;

<BR>Love not the heav'nly Spirits, and how thir Love

<BR>Express they, by looks onely, or do they mix

<BR>Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch?

<BR>To whom the Angel with a smile that glow'd

<BR>Celestial rosie red, Loves proper hue,

<BR>Answer'd. Let it suffice thee that thou know'st

<BR>Us happie, and without Love no happiness.

<BR>Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy'st

<BR>(And pure thou wert created) we enjoy

<BR>In eminence, and obstacle find none

<BR>Of membrane, joynt, or limb, exclusive barrs:

<BR>Easier then Air with Air, if Spirits embrace,

<BR>Total they mix, Union of Pure with Pure

<BR>Desiring; nor restrain'd conveyance need

<BR>As Flesh to mix with Flesh, or Soul with Soul.

<BR>But I can now no more; the parting Sun

<BR>Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles

<BR>HESPEREAN sets, my Signal to depart.

<BR>Be strong, live happie, and love, but first of all

<BR>Him whom to love is to obey, and keep

<BR>His great command; take heed least Passion sway

<BR>Thy Judgement to do aught, which else free Will

<BR>Would not admit; thine and of all thy Sons

<BR>The weal or woe in thee is plac't; beware.

<BR>I in thy persevering shall rejoyce,

<BR>And all the Blest: stand fast; to stand or fall

<BR>Free in thine own Arbitrement it lies.

<BR>Perfet within, no outward aid require;

<BR>And all temptation to transgress repel.

<BR>So saying, he arose; whom ADAM thus

<BR>Follow'd with benediction. Since to part,

<BR>Go heavenly Guest, Ethereal Messenger,

<BR>Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore.

<BR>Gentle to me and affable hath been

<BR>Thy condescension, and shall be honour'd ever

<BR>With grateful Memorie: thou to mankind

<BR>Be good and friendly still, and oft return.

<BR>So parted they, the Angel up to Heav'n

<BR>From the thick shade, and ADAM to his Bowre.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>No more of talk where God or Angel Guest

<BR>With Man, as with his Friend, familiar us'd

<BR>To sit indulgent, and with him partake

<BR>Rural repast, permitting him the while

<BR>Venial discourse unblam'd: I now must change

<BR>Those Notes to Tragic; foul distrust, and breach

<BR>Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt

<BR>And disobedience: On the part of Heav'n

<BR>Now alienated, distance and distaste,

<BR>Anger and just rebuke, and judgement giv'n,

<BR>That brought into this World a world of woe,

<BR>Sinne and her shadow Death, and Miserie

<BR>Deaths Harbinger: Sad task, yet argument

<BR>Not less but more Heroic then the wrauth

<BR>Of stern ACHILLES on his Foe pursu'd

<BR>Thrice Fugitive about TROY Wall; or rage

<BR>Of TURNUS for LAVINIA disespous'd,

<BR>Or NEPTUN'S ire or JUNO'S, that so long

<BR>Perplex'd the GREEK and CYTHEREA'S Son;

<BR>If answerable style I can obtaine

<BR>Of my Celestial Patroness, who deignes

<BR>Her nightly visitation unimplor'd,

<BR>And dictates to me slumbring, or inspires

<BR>Easie my unpremeditated Verse:

<BR>Since first this subject for Heroic Song

<BR>Pleas'd me long choosing, and beginning late;

<BR>Not sedulous by Nature to indite

<BR>Warrs, hitherto the onely Argument

<BR>Heroic deem'd, chief maistrie to dissect

<BR>With long and tedious havoc fabl'd Knights

<BR>In Battels feign'd; the better fortitude

<BR>Of Patience and Heroic Martyrdom

<BR>Unsung; or to describe Races and Games,

<BR>Or tilting Furniture, emblazon'd Shields,

<BR>Impreses quaint, Caparisons and Steeds;

<BR>Bases and tinsel Trappings, gorgious Knights

<BR>At Joust and Torneament; then marshal'd Feast

<BR>Serv'd up in Hall with Sewers, and Seneshals;

<BR>The skill of Artifice or Office mean,

<BR>Not that which justly gives Heroic name

<BR>To Person or to Poem. Mee of these

<BR>Nor skilld nor studious, higher Argument

<BR>Remaines, sufficient of it self to raise

<BR>That name, unless an age too late, or cold

<BR>Climat, or Years damp my intended wing

<BR>Deprest, and much they may, if all be mine,

<BR>Not Hers who brings it nightly to my Ear.

<BR>The Sun was sunk, and after him the Starr

<BR>Of HESPERUS, whose Office is to bring

<BR>Twilight upon the Earth, short Arbiter

<BR>Twixt Day and Night, and now from end to end

<BR>Nights Hemisphere had veild the Horizon round:

<BR>When SATAN who late fled before the threats

<BR>Of GABRIEL out of EDEN, now improv'd

<BR>In meditated fraud and malice, bent

<BR>On mans destruction, maugre what might hap

<BR>Of heavier on himself, fearless return'd.

<BR>By Night he fled, and at Midnight return'd

<BR>From compassing the Earth, cautious of day,

<BR>Since URIEL Regent of the Sun descri'd

<BR>His entrance, and forewarnd the Cherubim

<BR>That kept thir watch; thence full of anguish driv'n,

<BR>The space of seven continu'd Nights he rode

<BR>With darkness, thrice the Equinoctial Line

<BR>He circl'd, four times cross'd the Carr of Night

<BR>From Pole to Pole, traversing each Colure;

<BR>On the eighth return'd, and on the Coast averse

<BR>From entrance or Cherubic Watch, by stealth

<BR>Found unsuspected way. There was a place,

<BR>Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wraught the change,

<BR>Where TIGRIS at the foot of Paradise

<BR>Into a Gulf shot under ground, till part

<BR>Rose up a Fountain by the Tree of Life;

<BR>In with the River sunk, and with it rose

<BR>Satan involv'd in rising Mist, then sought

<BR>Where to lie hid; Sea he had searcht and Land

<BR>From EDEN over PONTUS, and the Poole

<BR>MAEOTIS, up beyond the River OB;

<BR>Downward as farr Antartic; and in length

<BR>West from ORANTES to the Ocean barr'd

<BR>At DARIEN, thence to the Land where flowes

<BR>GANGES and INDUS: thus the Orb he roam'd

<BR>With narrow search; and with inspection deep

<BR>Consider'd every Creature, which of all

<BR>Most opportune might serve his Wiles, and found

<BR>The Serpent suttlest Beast of all the Field.

<BR>Him after long debate, irresolute

<BR>Of thoughts revolv'd, his final sentence chose

<BR>Fit Vessel, fittest Imp of fraud, in whom

<BR>To enter, and his dark suggestions hide

<BR>From sharpest sight: for in the wilie Snake,

<BR>Whatever sleights none would suspicious mark,

<BR>As from his wit and native suttletie

<BR>Proceeding, which in other Beasts observ'd

<BR>Doubt might beget of Diabolic pow'r

<BR>Active within beyond the sense of brute.

<BR>Thus he resolv'd, but first from inward griefe

<BR>His bursting passion into plaints thus pour'd:

<BR>O Earth, how like to Heav'n, if not preferrd

<BR>More justly, Seat worthier of Gods, as built

<BR>With second thoughts, reforming what was old!

<BR>For what God after better worse would build?

<BR>Terrestrial Heav'n, danc't round by other Heav'ns

<BR>That shine, yet bear thir bright officious Lamps,

<BR>Light above Light, for thee alone, as seems,

<BR>In thee concentring all thir precious beams

<BR>Of sacred influence: As God in Heav'n

<BR>Is Center, yet extends to all, so thou

<BR>Centring receav'st from all those Orbs; in thee,

<BR>Not in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers

<BR>Productive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth

<BR>Of Creatures animate with gradual life

<BR>Of Growth, Sense, Reason, all summ'd up in Man.

<BR>With what delight could I have walkt thee round

<BR>If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange

<BR>Of Hill and Vallie, Rivers, Woods and Plaines,

<BR>Now Land, now Sea, &amp; Shores with Forrest crownd,

<BR>Rocks, Dens, and Caves; but I in none of these

<BR>Find place or refuge; and the more I see

<BR>Pleasures about me, so much more I feel

<BR>Torment within me, as from the hateful siege

<BR>Of contraries; all good to me becomes

<BR>Bane, and in Heav'n much worse would be my state.

<BR>But neither here seek I, no nor in Heav'n

<BR>To dwell, unless by maistring Heav'ns Supreame;

<BR>Nor hope to be my self less miserable

<BR>By what I seek, but others to make such

<BR>As I though thereby worse to me redound:

<BR>For onely in destroying I finde ease

<BR>To my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd,

<BR>Or won to what may work his utter loss,

<BR>For whom all this was made, all this will soon

<BR>Follow, as to him linkt in weal or woe,

<BR>In wo then; that destruction wide may range:

<BR>To mee shall be the glorie sole among

<BR>The infernal Powers, in one day to have marr'd

<BR>What he ALMIGHTIE styl'd, six Nights and Days

<BR>Continu'd making, and who knows how long

<BR>Before had bin contriving, though perhaps

<BR>Not longer then since I in one Night freed

<BR>From servitude inglorious welnigh half

<BR>Th' Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng

<BR>Of his adorers: hee to be aveng'd,

<BR>And to repaire his numbers thus impair'd,

<BR>Whether such vertue spent of old now faild

<BR>More Angels to Create, if they at least

<BR>Are his Created or to spite us more,

<BR>Determin'd to advance into our room

<BR>A Creature form'd of Earth, and him endow,

<BR>Exalted from so base original,

<BR>With Heav'nly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed

<BR>He effected; Man he made, and for him built

<BR>Magnificent this World, and Earth his seat,

<BR>Him Lord pronounc'd, and, O indignitie!

<BR>Subjected to his service Angel wings,

<BR>And flaming Ministers to watch and tend

<BR>Thir earthlie Charge: Of these the vigilance

<BR>I dread, and to elude, thus wrapt in mist

<BR>Of midnight vapor glide obscure, and prie

<BR>In every Bush and Brake, where hap may finde

<BR>The Serpent sleeping, in whose mazie foulds

<BR>To hide me, and the dark intent I bring.

<BR>O foul descent! that I who erst contended

<BR>With Gods to sit the highest, am now constraind

<BR>Into a Beast, and mixt with bestial slime,

<BR>This essence to incarnate and imbrute,

<BR>That to the hight of Deitie aspir'd;

<BR>But what will not Ambition and Revenge

<BR>Descend to? who aspires must down as low

<BR>As high he soard, obnoxious first or last

<BR>To basest things. Revenge, at first though sweet,

<BR>Bitter ere long back on it self recoiles;

<BR>Let it; I reck not, so it light well aim'd,

<BR>Since higher I fall short, on him who next

<BR>Provokes my envie, this new Favorite

<BR>Of Heav'n, this Man of Clay, Son of despite,

<BR>Whom us the more to spite his Maker rais'd

<BR>From dust: spite then with spite is best repaid.

<BR>So saying, through each Thicket Danck or Drie,

<BR>Like a black mist low creeping, he held on

<BR>His midnight search, where soonest he might finde

<BR>The Serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found

<BR>In Labyrinth of many a round self-rowl'd,

<BR>His head the midst, well stor'd with suttle wiles:

<BR>Not yet in horrid Shade or dismal Den,

<BR>Not nocent yet, but on the grassie Herbe

<BR>Fearless unfeard he slept: in at his Mouth

<BR>The Devil enterd, and his brutal sense,

<BR>In heart or head, possessing soon inspir'd

<BR>With act intelligential; but his sleep

<BR>Disturbd not, waiting close th' approach of Morn.

<BR>Now whenas sacred Light began to dawne

<BR>In EDEN on the humid Flours, that breathd

<BR>Thir morning Incense, when all things that breath,

<BR>From th' Earths great Altar send up silent praise

<BR>To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill

<BR>With gratefull Smell, forth came the human pair

<BR>And joynd thir vocal Worship to the Quire

<BR>Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake

<BR>The season, prime for sweetest Sents and Aires:

<BR>Then commune how that day they best may ply

<BR>Thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew

<BR>The hands dispatch of two Gardning so wide.

<BR>And EVE first to her Husband thus began.

<BR>ADAM, well may we labour still to dress

<BR>This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour.

<BR>Our pleasant task enjoyn'd, but till more hands

<BR>Aid us, the work under our labour grows,

<BR>Luxurious by restraint; what we by day

<BR>Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind,

<BR>One night or two with wanton growth derides

<BR>Tending to wilde. Thou therefore now advise

<BR>Or hear what to my mind first thoughts present,

<BR>Let us divide our labours, thou where choice

<BR>Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind

<BR>The Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct

<BR>The clasping Ivie where to climb, while I

<BR>In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt

<BR>With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon:

<BR>For while so near each other thus all day

<BR>Our task we choose, what wonder if no near

<BR>Looks intervene and smiles, or object new

<BR>Casual discourse draw on, which intermits

<BR>Our dayes work brought to little, though begun

<BR>Early, and th' hour of Supper comes unearn'd.

<BR>To whom mild answer ADAM thus return'd.

<BR>Sole EVE, Associate sole, to me beyond

<BR>Compare above all living Creatures deare,

<BR>Well hast thou motion'd, wel thy thoughts imployd

<BR>How we might best fulfill the work which here

<BR>God hath assign'd us, nor of me shalt pass

<BR>Unprais'd: for nothing lovelier can be found

<BR>In woman, then to studie houshold good,

<BR>And good workes in her Husband to promote.

<BR>Yet not so strictly hath our Lord impos'd

<BR>Labour, as to debarr us when we need

<BR>Refreshment, whether food, or talk between,

<BR>Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse

<BR>Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow,

<BR>To brute deni'd, and are of Love the food,

<BR>Love not the lowest end of human life.

<BR>For not to irksom toile, but to delight

<BR>He made us, and delight to Reason joyn'd.

<BR>These paths and Bowers doubt not but our joynt

<BR>Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide

<BR>As we need walk, till younger hands ere long

<BR>Assist us: But if much converse perhaps

<BR>Thee satiate, to short absence I could yeild.

<BR>For solitude somtimes is best societie,

<BR>And short retirement urges sweet returne.

<BR>But other doubt possesses me, least harm

<BR>Befall thee sever'd from me; for thou knowst

<BR>What hath bin warn'd us, what malicious Foe

<BR>Envying our happiness, and of his own

<BR>Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame

<BR>By sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand

<BR>Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find

<BR>His wish and best advantage, us asunder,

<BR>Hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each

<BR>To other speedie aide might lend at need;

<BR>Whether his first design be to withdraw

<BR>Our fealtie from God, or to disturb

<BR>Conjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss

<BR>Enjoy'd by us excites his envie more;

<BR>Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side

<BR>That gave thee being, stil shades thee and protects.

<BR>The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,

<BR>Safest and seemliest by her Husband staies,

<BR>Who guards her, or with her the worst endures.

<BR>To whom the Virgin Majestie of EVE,

<BR>As one who loves, and some unkindness meets,

<BR>With sweet austeer composure thus reply'd.

<BR>Ofspring of Heav'n and Earth, and all Earths Lord,

<BR>That such an enemie we have, who seeks

<BR>Our ruin, both by thee informd I learne,

<BR>And from the parting Angel over-heard

<BR>As in a shadie nook I stood behind,

<BR>Just then returnd at shut of Evening Flours.

<BR>But that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt

<BR>To God or thee, because we have a foe

<BR>May tempt it, I expected not to hear.

<BR>His violence thou fearst not, being such,

<BR>As wee, not capable of death or paine,

<BR>Can either not receave, or can repell.

<BR>His fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs

<BR>Thy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love

<BR>Can by his fraud be shak'n or seduc't;

<BR>Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy Brest,

<BR>ADAM, misthought of her to thee so dear?

<BR>To whom with healing words ADAM reply'd.

<BR>Daughter of God and Man, immortal EVE,

<BR>For such thou art, from sin and blame entire:

<BR>Not diffident of thee do I dissuade

<BR>Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid

<BR>Th' attempt it self, intended by our Foe.

<BR>For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses

<BR>The tempted with dishonour foul, suppos'd

<BR>Not incorruptible of Faith, not prooff

<BR>Against temptation: thou thy self with scorne

<BR>And anger wouldst resent the offer'd wrong,

<BR>Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then,

<BR>If such affront I labour to avert

<BR>From thee alone, which on us both at once

<BR>The Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare,

<BR>Or daring, first on mee th' assault shall light.

<BR>Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn;

<BR>Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce

<BR>Angels, nor think superfluous others aid.

<BR>I from the influence of thy looks receave

<BR>Access in every Vertue, in thy sight

<BR>More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were

<BR>Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on,

<BR>Shame to be overcome or over-reacht

<BR>Would utmost vigor raise, and rais'd unite.

<BR>Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel

<BR>When I am present, and thy trial choose

<BR>With me, best witness of thy Vertue tri'd.

<BR>So spake domestick ADAM in his care

<BR>And Matrimonial Love, but EVE, who thought

<BR>Less attributed to her Faith sincere,

<BR>Thus her reply with accent sweet renewd.

<BR>If this be our condition, thus to dwell

<BR>In narrow circuit strait'nd by a Foe,

<BR>Suttle or violent, we not endu'd

<BR>Single with like defence, wherever met,

<BR>How are we happie, still in fear of harm?

<BR>But harm precedes not sin: onely our Foe

<BR>Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem

<BR>Of our integritie: his foul esteeme

<BR>Sticks no dishonor on our Front, but turns

<BR>Foul on himself; then wherfore shund or feard

<BR>By us? who rather double honour gaine

<BR>From his surmise prov'd false, finde peace within,

<BR>Favour from Heav'n, our witness from th' event.

<BR>And what is Faith, Love, Vertue unassaid

<BR>Alone, without exterior help sustaind?

<BR>Let us not then suspect our happie State

<BR>Left so imperfet by the Maker wise,

<BR>As not secure to single or combin'd.

<BR>Fraile is our happiness, if this be so,

<BR>And EDEN were no EDEN thus expos'd.

<BR>To whom thus ADAM fervently repli'd.

<BR>O Woman, best are all things as the will

<BR>Of God ordaind them, his creating hand

<BR>Nothing imperfet or deficient left

<BR>Of all that he Created, much less Man,

<BR>Or ought that might his happie State secure,

<BR>Secure from outward force; within himself

<BR>The danger lies, yet lies within his power:

<BR>Against his will he can receave no harme.

<BR>But God left free the Will, for what obeyes

<BR>Reason, is free, and Reason he made right,

<BR>But bid her well beware, and still erect,

<BR>Least by some faire appeering good surpris'd

<BR>She dictate false, and missinforme the Will

<BR>To do what God expresly hath forbid.

<BR>Not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes,

<BR>That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me.

<BR>Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve,

<BR>Since Reason not impossibly may meet

<BR>Some specious object by the Foe subornd,

<BR>And fall into deception unaware,

<BR>Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd.

<BR>Seek not temptation then, which to avoide

<BR>Were better, and most likelie if from mee

<BR>Thou sever not; Trial will come unsought.

<BR>Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve

<BR>First thy obedience; th' other who can know,

<BR>Not seeing thee attempted, who attest?

<BR>But if thou think, trial unsought may finde

<BR>Us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst,

<BR>Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more;

<BR>Go in thy native innocence, relie

<BR>On what thou hast of vertue, summon all,

<BR>For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine.

<BR>So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde, but EVE

<BR>Persisted, yet submiss, though last, repli'd.

<BR>With thy permission then, and thus forewarnd

<BR>Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words

<BR>Touchd onely, that our trial, when least sought,

<BR>May finde us both perhaps farr less prepar'd,

<BR>The willinger I goe, nor much expect

<BR>A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek;

<BR>So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse.

<BR>Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand

<BR>Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light

<BR>OREAD or DRYAD, or of DELIA's Traine,

<BR>Betook her to the Groves, but DELIA's self

<BR>In gate surpass'd and Goddess-like deport,

<BR>Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd,

<BR>But with such Gardning Tools as Are yet rude,

<BR>Guiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought,

<BR>To PALES, or POMONA, thus adornd,

<BR>Likest she seemd, POMONA when she fled

<BR>VERTUMNUS, or to CERES in her Prime,

<BR>Yet Virgin of PROSERPINA from JOVE.

<BR>Her long with ardent look his EYE pursu'd

<BR>Delighted, but desiring more her stay.

<BR>Oft he to her his charge of quick returne,

<BR>Repeated, shee to him as oft engag'd

<BR>To be returnd by Noon amid the Bowre,

<BR>And all things in best order to invite

<BR>Noontide repast, or Afternoons repose.

<BR>O much deceav'd, much failing, hapless EVE,

<BR>Of thy presum'd return! event perverse!

<BR>Thou never from that houre in Paradise

<BR>Foundst either sweet repast, or found repose;

<BR>Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades

<BR>Waited with hellish rancor imminent

<BR>To intercept thy way, or send thee back

<BR>Despoild of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss.

<BR>For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend,

<BR>Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come,

<BR>And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde

<BR>The onely two of Mankinde, but in them

<BR>The whole included Race, his purposd prey.

<BR>In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft

<BR>Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay,

<BR>Thir tendance or Plantation for delight,

<BR>By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet

<BR>He sought them both, but wish'd his hap might find

<BR>EVE separate, he wish'd, but not with hope

<BR>Of what so seldom chanc'd, when to his wish,

<BR>Beyond his hope, EVE separate he spies,

<BR>Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood,

<BR>Half spi'd, so thick the Roses bushing round

<BR>About her glowd, oft stooping to support

<BR>Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay

<BR>Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold,

<BR>Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies

<BR>Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while,

<BR>Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour,

<BR>From her best prop so farr, and storn so nigh.

<BR>Neererhe drew, and many a walk travers'd

<BR>Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme,

<BR>Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen

<BR>Among thick-wov'n Arborets and Flours

<BR>Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of EVE:

<BR>Spot more delicious then those Gardens feign'd

<BR>Or of reviv'd ADONIS, or renownd

<BR>ALCINOUS, host of old LAERTES Son,

<BR>Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King

<BR>Held dalliance with his faire EGYPTIAN Spouse.

<BR>Much hee the Place admir'd, the Person more.

<BR>As one who long in populous City pent,

<BR>Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire,

<BR>Forth issuing on a Summers Morn, to breathe

<BR>Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes

<BR>Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight,

<BR>The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine,

<BR>Or Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound;

<BR>If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass,

<BR>What pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more,

<BR>She most, and in her look summs all Delight.

<BR>Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold

<BR>This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of EVE

<BR>Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav'nly forme

<BR>Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine,

<BR>Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire

<BR>Of gesture or lest action overawd

<BR>His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav'd

<BR>His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought:

<BR>That space the Evil one abstracted stood

<BR>From his own evil, and for the time remaind

<BR>Stupidly good, of enmitie disarm'd,

<BR>Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge;

<BR>But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes,

<BR>Though in mid Heav'n, soon ended his delight,

<BR>And tortures him now more, the more he sees

<BR>Of pleasure not for him ordain'd: then soon

<BR>Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts

<BR>Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites.

<BR>Thoughts, whither have he led me, with what sweet

<BR>Compulsion thus transported to forget

<BR>What hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope

<BR>Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste

<BR>Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy,

<BR>Save what is in destroying, other joy

<BR>To me is lost. Then let me not let pass

<BR>Occasion which now smiles, behold alone

<BR>The Woman, opportune to all attempts,

<BR>Her Husband, for I view far round, not nigh,

<BR>Whose higher intellectual more I shun,

<BR>And strength, of courage hautie, and of limb

<BR>Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould,

<BR>Foe not informidable, exempt from wound,

<BR>I not; so much hath Hell debas'd, and paine

<BR>Infeebl'd me, to what I was in Heav'n.

<BR>Shee fair, divinely fair, fit Love for Gods,

<BR>Not terrible, though terrour be in Love

<BR>And beautie, not approacht by stronger hate,

<BR>Hate stronger, under shew of Love well feign'd,

<BR>The way which to her ruin now I tend.

<BR>So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos'd

<BR>In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward EVE

<BR>Address'd his way, not with indented wave,

<BR>Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare,

<BR>Circular base of rising foulds, that tour'd

<BR>Fould above fould a surging Maze, his Head

<BR>Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes;

<BR>With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect

<BR>Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass

<BR>Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape,

<BR>And lovely, never since of Serpent kind

<BR>Lovelier, not those that in ILLYRIA chang'd

<BR>HERMIONE and CADMUS, or the God

<BR>In EPIDAURUS; nor to which transformd

<BR>AMMONIAN JOVE, or CAPITOLINE was seen,

<BR>Hee with OLYMPIAS, this with her who bore

<BR>SCIPIO the highth of ROME. With tract oblique

<BR>At first, as one who sought access, but feard

<BR>To interrupt, side-long he works his way.

<BR>As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought

<BR>Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind

<BR>Veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile;

<BR>So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine

<BR>Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of EVE,

<BR>To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound

<BR>Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us'd

<BR>To such disport before her through the Field,

<BR>From every Beast, more duteous at her call,

<BR>Then at CIRCEAN call the Herd disguis'd.

<BR>Hee boulder now, uncall'd before her stood;

<BR>But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd

<BR>His turret Crest, and sleek enamel'd Neck,

<BR>Fawning, and lick'd the ground whereon she trod.

<BR>His gentle dumb expression turnd at length

<BR>The Eye of EVE to mark his play; he glad

<BR>Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue

<BR>Organic, or impulse of vocal Air,

<BR>His fraudulent temptation thus began.

<BR>Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps

<BR>Thou canst, who art sole Wonder, much less arm

<BR>Thy looks, the Heav'n of mildness, with disdain,

<BR>Displeas'd that I approach thee thus, and gaze

<BR>Insatiate, I thus single; nor have feard

<BR>Thy awful brow, more awful thus retir'd.

<BR>Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire,

<BR>Thee all living things gaze on, all things thine

<BR>By gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore

<BR>With ravishment beheld, there best beheld

<BR>Where universally admir'd; but here

<BR>In this enclosure wild, these Beasts among,

<BR>Beholders rude, and shallow to discerne

<BR>Half what in thee is fair, one man except,

<BR>Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen

<BR>A Goddess among Gods, ador'd and serv'd

<BR>By Angels numberless, thy daily Train.

<BR>So gloz'd the Tempter, and his Proem tun'd;

<BR>Into the Heart of EVE his words made way,

<BR>Though at the voice much marveling; at length

<BR>Not unamaz'd she thus in answer spake.

<BR>What may this mean? Language of Man pronounc't

<BR>By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest?

<BR>The first at lest of these I thought deni'd

<BR>To Beasts, whom God on their Creation-Day

<BR>Created mute to all articulat sound;

<BR>The latter I demurre, for in thir looks

<BR>Much reason, and in thir actions oft appeers.

<BR>Thee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field

<BR>I knew, but not with human voice endu'd;

<BR>Redouble then this miracle, and say,

<BR>How cam'st thou speakable of mute, and how

<BR>To me so friendly grown above the rest

<BR>Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight?

<BR>Say, for such wonder claims attention due.

<BR>To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply'd.

<BR>Empress of this fair World, resplendent EVE,

<BR>Easie to mee it is to tell thee all

<BR>What thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd:

<BR>I was at first as other Beasts that graze

<BR>The trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low,

<BR>As was my food, nor aught but food discern'd

<BR>Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high:

<BR>Till on a day roaving the field, I chanc'd

<BR>A goodly Tree farr distant to behold

<BR>Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt,

<BR>Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze;

<BR>When from the boughes a savorie odour blow'n,

<BR>Grateful to appetite, more pleas'd my sense

<BR>Then smell of sweetest Fenel, or the Teats

<BR>Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn,

<BR>Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play.

<BR>To satisfie the sharp desire I had

<BR>Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv'd

<BR>Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once,

<BR>Powerful perswaders, quick'nd at the scent

<BR>Of that alluring fruit, urg'd me so keene.

<BR>About the Mossie Trunk I wound me soon,

<BR>For high from ground the branches would require

<BR>Thy utmost reach or ADAMS: Round the Tree

<BR>All other Beasts that saw, with like desire

<BR>Longing and envying stood, but could not reach.

<BR>Amid the Tree now got, where plentie hung

<BR>Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill

<BR>I spar'd not, for such pleasure till that hour

<BR>At Feed or Fountain never had I found.

<BR>Sated at length, ere long I might perceave

<BR>Strange alteration in me, to degree

<BR>Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech

<BR>Wanted not long, though to this shape retaind.

<BR>Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep

<BR>I turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind

<BR>Considerd all things visible in Heav'n,

<BR>Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good;

<BR>But all that fair and good in thy Divine

<BR>Semblance, and in thy Beauties heav'nly Ray

<BR>United I beheld; no Fair to thine

<BR>Equivalent or second, which compel'd

<BR>Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come

<BR>And gaze, and worship thee of right declar'd

<BR>Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame.

<BR>So talk'd the spirited sly Snake; and EVE

<BR>Yet more amaz'd unwarie thus reply'd.

<BR>Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt

<BR>The vertue of that Fruit, in thee first prov'd:

<BR>But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far?

<BR>For many are the Trees of God that grow

<BR>In Paradise, and various, yet unknown

<BR>To us, in such abundance lies our choice,

<BR>As leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht,

<BR>Still hanging incorruptible, till men

<BR>Grow up to thir provision, and more hands

<BR>Help to disburden Nature of her Bearth.

<BR>To whom the wilie Adder, blithe and glad.

<BR>Empress, the way is readie, and not long,

<BR>Beyond a row of Myrtles, on a Flat,

<BR>Fast by a Fountain, one small Thicket past

<BR>Of blowing Myrrh and Balme; if thou accept

<BR>My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon.

<BR>Lead then, said EVE. Hee leading swiftly rowld

<BR>In tangles, and make intricate seem strait,

<BR>To mischief swift. Hope elevates, and joy

<BR>Bright'ns his Crest, as when a wandring Fire

<BR>Compact of unctuous vapor, which the Night

<BR>Condenses, and the cold invirons round,

<BR>Kindl'd through agitation to a Flame,

<BR>Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends,

<BR>Hovering and blazing with delusive Light,

<BR>Misleads th' amaz'd Night-wanderer from his way

<BR>To Boggs and Mires, &amp; oft through Pond or Poole,

<BR>There swallow'd up and lost, from succour farr.

<BR>So glister'd the dire Snake and into fraud

<BR>Led EVE our credulous Mother, to the Tree

<BR>Of prohibition, root of all our woe;

<BR>Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake.

<BR>Serpent, we might have spar'd our coming hither,

<BR>Fruitless to me, though Fruit be here to excess,

<BR>The credit of whose vertue rest with thee,

<BR>Wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects.

<BR>But of this Tree we may not taste nor touch;

<BR>God so commanded, and left that Command

<BR>Sole Daughter of his voice; the rest, we live

<BR>Law to our selves, our Reason is our Law.

<BR>To whom the Tempter guilefully repli'd.

<BR>Indeed? hath God then said that of the Fruit

<BR>Of all these Garden Trees ye shall not eate,

<BR>Yet Lords declar'd of all in Earth or Aire?

<BR>To whom thus EVE yet sinless. Of the Fruit

<BR>Of each Tree in the Garden we may eate,

<BR>But of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidst

<BR>The Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate

<BR>Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die.

<BR>She scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold

<BR>The Tempter, but with shew of Zeale and Love

<BR>To Man, and indignation at his wrong,

<BR>New part puts on, and as to passion mov'd,

<BR>Fluctuats disturbd, yet comely, and in act

<BR>Rais'd, as of som great matter to begin.

<BR>As when of old som Orator renound

<BR>In ATHENS or free ROME, where Eloquence

<BR>Flourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest,

<BR>Stood in himself collected, while each part,

<BR>Motion, each act won audience ere the tongue,

<BR>Somtimes in highth began, as no delay

<BR>Of Preface brooking through his Zeal of Right.

<BR>So standing, moving, or to highth upgrown

<BR>The Tempter all impassiond thus began.

<BR>O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant,

<BR>Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power

<BR>Within me cleere, not onely to discerne

<BR>Things in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes

<BR>Of highest Agents, deemd however wise.

<BR>Queen of this Universe, doe not believe

<BR>Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die:

<BR>How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life

<BR>To Knowledge? By the Threatner, look on mee,

<BR>Mee who have touch'd and tasted, yet both live,

<BR>And life more perfet have attaind then Fate

<BR>Meant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot.

<BR>Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast

<BR>Is open? or will God incense his ire

<BR>For such a pretty Trespass, and not praise

<BR>Rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain

<BR>Of Death denounc't, whatever thing Death be,

<BR>Deterrd not from atchieving what might leade

<BR>To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil;

<BR>Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil

<BR>Be real, why not known, since easier shunnd?

<BR>God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just;

<BR>Not just, not God; not feard then, nor obeid:

<BR>Your feare it self of Death removes the feare.

<BR>Why then was this forbid? Why but to awe,

<BR>Why but to keep ye low and ignorant,

<BR>His worshippers; he knows that in the day

<BR>Ye Eate thereof, your Eyes that seem so cleere,

<BR>Yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then

<BR>Op'nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as Gods,

<BR>Knowing both Good and Evil as they know.

<BR>That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man,

<BR>Internal Man, is but proportion meet,

<BR>I of brute human, yee of human Gods.

<BR>So ye shalt die perhaps, by putting off

<BR>Human, to put on Gods, death to be wisht,

<BR>Though threat'nd, which no worse then this can bring

<BR>And what are Gods that Man may not become

<BR>As they, participating God-like food?

<BR>The Gods are first, and that advantage use

<BR>On our belief, that all from them proceeds,

<BR>I question it, for this fair Earth I see,

<BR>Warm'd by the Sun, producing every kind,

<BR>Them nothing: If they all things, who enclos'd

<BR>Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree,

<BR>That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains

<BR>Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies

<BR>Th' offence, that Man should thus attain to know?

<BR>What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree

<BR>Impart against his will if all be his?

<BR>Or is it envie, and can envie dwell

<BR>In heav'nly brests? these, these and many more

<BR>Causes import your need of this fair Fruit.

<BR>Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste.

<BR>He ended, and his words replete with guile

<BR>Into her heart too easie entrance won:

<BR>Fixt on the Fruit she gaz'd, which to behold

<BR>Might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound

<BR>Yet rung of his perswasive words, impregn'd

<BR>With Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth;

<BR>Meanwhile the hour of Noon drew on, and wak'd

<BR>An eager appetite, rais'd by the smell

<BR>So savorie of that Fruit, which with desire,

<BR>Inclinable now grown to touch or taste,

<BR>Sollicited her longing eye; yet first

<BR>Pausing a while, thus to her self she mus'd.

<BR>Great are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits,

<BR>Though kept from Man, &amp; worthy to be admir'd,

<BR>Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay

<BR>Gave elocution to the mute, and taught

<BR>The Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise:

<BR>Thy praise hee also who forbids thy use,

<BR>Conceales not from us, naming thee the Tree

<BR>Of Knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil;

<BR>Forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding

<BR>Commends thee more, while it inferrs the good

<BR>By thee communicated, and our want:

<BR>For good unknown, sure is not had, or had

<BR>And yet unknown, is as not had at all.

<BR>In plain then, what forbids he but to know,

<BR>Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise?

<BR>Such prohibitions binde not. But if Death

<BR>Bind us with after-bands, what profits then

<BR>Our inward freedom? In the day we eate

<BR>Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die.

<BR>How dies the Serpent? hee hath eat'n and lives,

<BR>And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discernes,

<BR>Irrational till then. For us alone

<BR>Was death invented? or to us deni'd

<BR>This intellectual food, for beasts reserv'd?

<BR>For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first

<BR>Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy

<BR>The good befall'n him, Author unsuspect,

<BR>Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile.

<BR>What fear I then, rather what know to feare

<BR>Under this ignorance of Good and Evil,

<BR>Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie?

<BR>Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine,

<BR>Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste,

<BR>Of vertue to make wise: what hinders then

<BR>To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind?

<BR>So saying, her rash hand in evil hour

<BR>Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck'd, she eat:

<BR>Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat

<BR>Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe,

<BR>That all was lost. Back to the Thicket slunk

<BR>The guiltie Serpent, and well might, for EVE

<BR>Intent now wholly on her taste, naught else

<BR>Regarded, such delight till then, as seemd,

<BR>In Fruit she never tasted, whether true

<BR>Or fansied so, through expectation high

<BR>Of knowledg, nor was God-head from her thought.

<BR>Greedily she ingorg'd without restraint,

<BR>And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length,

<BR>And hight'nd as with Wine, jocond and boon,

<BR>Thus to her self she pleasingly began.

<BR>O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees

<BR>In Paradise, of operation blest

<BR>To Sapience, hitherto obscur'd, infam'd,

<BR>And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end

<BR>Created; but henceforth my early care,

<BR>Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise

<BR>Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease

<BR>Of thy full branches offer'd free to all;

<BR>Till dieted by thee I grow mature

<BR>In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know;

<BR>Though others envie what they cannot give;

<BR>For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here

<BR>Thus grown. Experience, next to thee I owe,

<BR>Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind

<BR>In ignorance, thou op'nst Wisdoms way,

<BR>And giv'st access, though secret she retire.

<BR>And I perhaps am secret; Heav'n is high,

<BR>High and remote to see from thence distinct

<BR>Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps

<BR>May have diverted from continual watch

<BR>Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies

<BR>About him. But to ADAM in what sort

<BR>Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known

<BR>As yet my change, and give him to partake

<BR>Full happiness with mee, or rather not,

<BR>But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power

<BR>Without Copartner? so to add what wants

<BR>In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love,

<BR>And render me more equal, and perhaps

<BR>A thing not undesireable, somtime

<BR>Superior; for inferior who is free?

<BR>This may be well: but what if God have seen,

<BR>And Death ensue? then I shall be no more,

<BR>And ADAM wedded to another EVE,

<BR>Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct;

<BR>A death to think. Confirm'd then I resolve,

<BR>ADAM shall share with me in bliss or woe:

<BR>So dear I love him, that with him all deaths

<BR>I could endure; without him live no life.

<BR>So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd,

<BR>But first low Reverence don, as to the power

<BR>That dwelt within, whose presence had infus'd

<BR>Into the plant sciential sap, deriv'd

<BR>From Nectar, drink of Gods. ADAM the while

<BR>Waiting desirous her return, had wove

<BR>Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne

<BR>Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown

<BR>As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen.

<BR>Great joy he promis'd to his thoughts, and new

<BR>Solace in her return, so long delay'd;

<BR>Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill,

<BR>Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt;

<BR>And forth to meet her went, the way she took

<BR>That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree

<BR>Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met,

<BR>Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand

<BR>A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil'd,

<BR>New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus'd.

<BR>To him she hasted, in her face excuse

<BR>Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt,

<BR>Which with bland words at will she thus addrest.

<BR>Hast thou not wonderd, ADAM, at my stay?

<BR>Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv'd

<BR>Thy presence, agonie of love till now

<BR>Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more

<BR>Mean I to trie, what rash untri'd I sought,

<BR>The paine of absence from thy sight. But strange

<BR>Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare:

<BR>This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree

<BR>Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown

<BR>Op'ning the way, but of Divine effect

<BR>To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste;

<BR>And hath bin tasted such; the Serpent wise,

<BR>Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying,

<BR>Hath eat'n of the fruit, and is become,

<BR>Not dead, as we are threatn'd, but thenceforth

<BR>Endu'd with human voice and human sense,

<BR>Reasoning to admiration, and with mee

<BR>Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I

<BR>Have also tasted, and have also found

<BR>Th' effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes,

<BR>Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart,

<BR>And growing up to Godhead; which for thee

<BR>Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.

<BR>For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss,

<BR>Tedious, unshar'd with thee, and odious soon.

<BR>Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot

<BR>May joyne us, equal Joy, as equal Love;

<BR>Least thou not tasting, different degree

<BR>Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce

<BR>Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit.

<BR>Thus EVE with Countnance blithe her storie told;

<BR>But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd.

<BR>On th' other side, ADAM, soon as he heard

<BR>The fatal Trespass don by EVE, amaz'd,

<BR>Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill

<BR>Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax'd;

<BR>From his slack hand the Garland wreath'd for EVE

<BR>Down drop'd, and all the faded Roses shed:

<BR>Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length

<BR>First to himself he inward silence broke.

<BR>O fairest of Creation, last and best

<BR>Of all Gods Works, Creature in whom excell'd

<BR>Whatever can to fight or thought be found,

<BR>Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet!

<BR>How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost,

<BR>Defac't, deflourd, and now to Death devote?

<BR>Rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress

<BR>The strict forbiddance, how to violate

<BR>The sacred Fruit forbidd'n! som cursed fraud

<BR>Of Enemie hath beguil'd thee, yet unknown,

<BR>And mee with thee hath ruind, for with thee

<BR>Certain my resolution is to Die;

<BR>How can I live without thee, how forgoe

<BR>Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyn'd,

<BR>To live again in these wilde Woods forlorn?

<BR>Should God create another EVE, and I

<BR>Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee

<BR>Would never from my heart; no no, I feel

<BR>The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh,

<BR>Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State

<BR>Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe.

<BR>So having said, as one from sad dismay

<BR>Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbd

<BR>Submitting to what seemd remediless,

<BR>Thus in calme mood his Words to EVE he turnd.

<BR>Bold deed thou hast presum'd, adventrous EVE,

<BR>And peril great provok't, who thus hast dar'd

<BR>Had it bin onely coveting to Eye

<BR>That sacred Fruit, sacred to abstinence,

<BR>Much more to taste it under banne to touch.

<BR>But past who can recall, or don undoe?

<BR>Not God omnipotent, for Fate, yet so

<BR>Perhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the Fact

<BR>Is not so hainous now, foretasted Fruit,

<BR>Profan'd first by the Serpent, by him first

<BR>Made common and unhallowd: ere one tastes;

<BR>Nor yet on him found deadly; he yet lives,

<BR>Lives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as Man

<BR>Higher degree of Life, inducement strong

<BR>To us, as likely tasting to attaine

<BR>Proportional ascent, which cannot be

<BR>But to be Gods, or Angels Demi-gods.

<BR>Nor can I think that God, Creator wise,

<BR>Though threatning, will in earnest so destroy

<BR>Us his prime Creatures, dignifi'd so high,

<BR>Set over all his Works, which in our Fall,

<BR>For us created, needs with us must faile,

<BR>Dependent made; so God shall uncreate,

<BR>Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour loose,

<BR>Not well conceav'd of God, who though his Power

<BR>Creation could repeate, yet would be loath

<BR>Us to abolish, least the Adversary

<BR>Triumph and say; Fickle their State whom God

<BR>Most Favors, who can please him long? Mee first

<BR>He ruind, now Mankind; whom will he next?

<BR>Matter of scorne, not to be given the Foe.

<BR>However I with thee have fixt my Lot,

<BR>Certain to undergoe like doom, if Death

<BR>Consort with thee, Death is to mee as Life;

<BR>So forcible within my heart I feel

<BR>The Bond of Nature draw me to my owne,

<BR>My own in thee, for what thou art is mine;

<BR>Our State cannot be severd, we are one,

<BR>One Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self.

<BR>So ADAM, and thus EVE to him repli'd.

<BR>O glorious trial of exceeding Love,

<BR>Illustrious evidence, example high!

<BR>Ingaging me to emulate, but short

<BR>Of thy perfection, how shall I attaine,

<BR>ADAM, from whose deare side I boast me sprung,

<BR>And gladly of our Union heare thee speak,

<BR>One Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff

<BR>This day affords, declaring thee resolvd,

<BR>Rather then Death or aught then Death more dread

<BR>Shall separate us, linkt in Love so deare,

<BR>To undergoe with mee one Guilt, one Crime,

<BR>If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit,

<BR>Whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds,

<BR>Direct, or by occasion hath presented

<BR>This happie trial of thy Love, which else

<BR>So eminently never had bin known.

<BR>Were it I thought Death menac't would ensue

<BR>This my attempt, I would sustain alone

<BR>The worst, and not perswade thee, rather die

<BR>Deserted, then oblige thee with a fact

<BR>Pernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assur'd

<BR>Remarkably so late of thy so true,

<BR>So faithful Love unequald; but I feel

<BR>Farr otherwise th' event, not Death, but Life

<BR>Augmented, op'nd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes,

<BR>Taste so Divine, that what of sweet before

<BR>Hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh.

<BR>On my experience, ADAM, freely taste,

<BR>And fear of Death deliver to the Windes.

<BR>So saying, she embrac'd him, and for joy

<BR>Tenderly wept, much won that he his Love

<BR>Had so enobl'd, as of choice to incurr

<BR>Divine displeasure for her sake, or Death.

<BR>In recompence (for such compliance bad

<BR>Such recompence best merits) from the bough

<BR>She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit

<BR>With liberal hand: he scrupl'd not to eat

<BR>Against his better knowledge, not deceav'd,

<BR>But fondly overcome with Femal charm.

<BR>Earth trembl'd from her entrails, as again

<BR>In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan,

<BR>Skie lowr'd, and muttering Thunder, som sad drops

<BR>Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin

<BR>Original; while ADAM took no thought,

<BR>Eating his fill, nor EVE to iterate

<BR>Her former trespass fear'd, the more to soothe

<BR>Him with her lov'd societie, that now

<BR>As with new Wine intoxicated both

<BR>They swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel

<BR>Divinitie within them breeding wings

<BR>Wherewith to scorn the Earth: but that false Fruit

<BR>Farr other operation first displaid,

<BR>Carnal desire enflaming, hee on EVE

<BR>Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him

<BR>As wantonly repaid; in Lust they burne:

<BR>Till ADAM thus 'gan EVE to dalliance move.

<BR>EVE, now I see thou art exact of taste,

<BR>And elegant, of Sapience no small part,

<BR>Since to each meaning savour we apply,

<BR>And Palate call judicious; I the praise

<BR>Yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey'd.

<BR>Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstain'd

<BR>From this delightful Fruit, nor known till now

<BR>True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be

<BR>In things to us forbidden, it might be wish'd,

<BR>For this one Tree had bin forbidden ten.

<BR>But come, so well refresh't, now let us play,

<BR>As meet is, after such delicious Fare;

<BR>For never did thy Beautie since the day

<BR>I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorn'd

<BR>With all perfections, so enflame my sense

<BR>With ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now

<BR>Then ever, bountie of this vertuous Tree.

<BR>So said he, and forbore not glance or toy

<BR>Of amorous intent, well understood

<BR>Of EVE, whose Eye darted contagious Fire.

<BR>Her hand he seis'd, and to a shadie bank,

<BR>Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr'd

<BR>He led her nothing loath; Flours were the Couch,

<BR>Pansies, and Violets, and Asphodel,

<BR>And Hyacinth, Earths freshest softest lap.

<BR>There they thir fill of Love and Loves disport

<BR>Took largely, of thir mutual guilt the Seale,

<BR>The solace of thir sin, till dewie sleep

<BR>Oppress'd them, wearied with thir amorous play.

<BR>Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit,

<BR>That with exhilerating vapour bland

<BR>About thir spirits had plaid, and inmost powers

<BR>Made erre, was now exhal'd, and grosser sleep

<BR>Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams

<BR>Encumberd, now had left them, up they rose

<BR>As from unrest, and each the other viewing,

<BR>Soon found thir Eyes how op'nd, and thir minds

<BR>How dark'nd; innocence, that as a veile

<BR>Had shadow'd them from knowing ill, was gon,

<BR>Just confidence, and native righteousness,

<BR>And honour from about them, naked left

<BR>To guiltie shame hee cover'd, but his Robe

<BR>Uncover'd more. So rose the DANITE strong

<BR>HERCULEAN SAMSON from the Harlot-lap

<BR>Of PHILISTEAN DALILAH, and wak'd

<BR>Shorn of his strength, They destitute and bare

<BR>Of all thir vertue: silent, and in face

<BR>Confounded long they sate, as struck'n mute,

<BR>Till ADAM, though not less then EVE abasht,

<BR>At length gave utterance to these words constraind.

<BR>O EVE, in evil hour thou didst give care

<BR>To that false Worm, of whomsoever taught

<BR>To counterfet Mans voice, true in our Fall,

<BR>False in our promis'd Rising; since our Eyes

<BR>Op'nd we find indeed, and find we know

<BR>Both Good and Evil, Good lost and Evil got,

<BR>Bad Fruit of Knowledge, if this be to know,

<BR>Which leaves us naked thus, of Honour void,

<BR>Of Innocence, of Faith, of Puritie,

<BR>Our wonted Ornaments now soild and staind,

<BR>And in our Faces evident the signes

<BR>Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store;

<BR>Even shame, the last of evils; of the first

<BR>Be sure then. How shall I behold the face

<BR>Henceforth of God or Angel, earst with joy

<BR>And rapture so oft beheld? those heav'nly shapes

<BR>Will dazle now this earthly, with thir blaze

<BR>Insufferably bright. O might I here

<BR>In solitude live savage, in some glad

<BR>Obscur'd, where highest Woods impenetrable

<BR>To Starr or Sun-light, spread thir umbrage broad,

<BR>And brown as Evening: Cover me ye Pines,

<BR>Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs

<BR>Hide me, where I may never see them more.

<BR>But let us now, as in bad plight, devise

<BR>What best may for the present serve to hide

<BR>The Parts of each from other, that seem most

<BR>To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen,

<BR>Some Tree whose broad smooth Leaves together sowd,

<BR>And girded on our loyns, may cover round

<BR>Those middle parts, that this new commer, Shame,

<BR>There sit not, and reproach us as unclean.

<BR>So counsel'd hee, and both together went

<BR>Into the thickest Wood, there soon they chose

<BR>The Figtree, not that kind for Fruit renown'd,

<BR>But such as at this day to INDIANS known

<BR>In MALABAR or DECAN spreds her Armes

<BR>Braunching so broad and long, that in the ground

<BR>The bended Twigs take root, and Daughters grow

<BR>About the Mother Tree, a Pillard shade

<BR>High overarch't, and echoing Walks between;

<BR>There oft the INDIAN Herdsman shunning heate

<BR>Shelters in coole, and tends his pasturing Herds

<BR>At Loopholes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves

<BR>They gatherd, broad as AMAZONIAN Targe,

<BR>And with what skill they had, together sowd,

<BR>To gird thir waste, vain Covering if to hide

<BR>Thir guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike

<BR>To that first naked Glorie. Such of late

<BR>COLUMBUS found th' AMERICAN to girt

<BR>With featherd Cincture, naked else and wilde

<BR>Among the Trees on Iles and woodie Shores.

<BR>Thus fenc't, and as they thought, thir shame in part

<BR>Coverd, but not at rest or ease of Mind,

<BR>They sate them down to weep, nor onely Teares

<BR>Raind at thir Eyes, but high Winds worse within

<BR>Began to rise, high Passions, Anger, Hate,

<BR>Mistrust, Suspicion, Discord, and shook sore

<BR>Thir inward State of Mind, calme Region once

<BR>And full of Peace, now tost and turbulent:

<BR>For Understanding rul'd not, and the Will

<BR>Heard not her lore, both in subjection now

<BR>To sensual Appetite, who from beneathe

<BR>Usurping over sovran Reason claimd

<BR>Superior sway: From thus distemperd brest,

<BR>ADAM, estrang'd in look and alterd stile,

<BR>Speech intermitted thus to EVE renewd.

<BR>Would thou hadst heark'nd to my words, &amp; stai'd

<BR>With me, as I besought thee, when that strange

<BR>Desire of wandring this unhappie Morn,

<BR>I know not whence possessd thee; we had then

<BR>Remaind still happie, not as now, despoild

<BR>Of all our good, sham'd, naked, miserable.

<BR>Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve

<BR>The Faith they owe; when earnestly they seek

<BR>Such proof, conclude, they then begin to faile.

<BR>To whom soon mov'd with touch of blame thus EVE.

<BR>What words have past thy Lips, ADAM severe,

<BR>Imput'st thou that to my default, or will

<BR>Of wandering, as thou call'st it, which who knows

<BR>But might as ill have happ'nd thou being by,

<BR>Or to thy self perhaps: hadst thou bin there,

<BR>Or bere th' attempt, thou couldst not have discernd

<BR>Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake;

<BR>No ground of enmitie between us known,

<BR>Why hee should mean me ill, or seek to harme.

<BR>Was I to have never parted from thy side?

<BR>As good have grown there still a liveless Rib.

<BR>Being as I am, why didst not thou the Head

<BR>Command me absolutely not to go,

<BR>Going into such danger as thou saidst?

<BR>Too facil then thou didst not much gainsay,

<BR>Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss.

<BR>Hadst thou bin firm and fixt in thy dissent,

<BR>Neither had I transgress'd, nor thou with mee.

<BR>To whom then first incenst ADAM repli'd.

<BR>Is this the Love, is the recompence

<BR>Of mine to thee, ingrateful EVE, exprest

<BR>Immutable when thou wert lost, not I,

<BR>Who might have liv'd and joyd immortal bliss,

<BR>Yet willingly chose rather Death with thee:

<BR>And am I now upbraided, as the cause

<BR>Of thy transgressing? not enough severe,

<BR>It seems, in thy restraint: what could I more?

<BR>I warn'd thee, I admonish'd thee, foretold

<BR>The danger, and the lurking Enemie

<BR>That lay in wait; beyond this had bin force,

<BR>And force upon free Will hath here no place.

<BR>But confidence then bore thee on, secure

<BR>Either to meet no danger, or to finde

<BR>Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps

<BR>I also err'd in overmuch admiring

<BR>What seemd in thee so perfet, that I thought

<BR>No evil durst attempt thee, but I rue

<BR>That errour now, which is become my crime,

<BR>And thou th' accuser. Thus it shall befall

<BR>Him who to worth in Women overtrusting

<BR>Lets her Will rule; restraint she will not brook,

<BR>And left to her self, if evil thence ensue,

<BR>Shee first his weak indulgence will accuse.

<BR>Thus they in mutual accusation spent

<BR>The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning

<BR>And of thir vain contest appeer'd no end.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>O For that warning voice, which he who saw

<BR>Th' APOCALYPS, heard cry in Heaven aloud,

<BR>Then when the Dragon, put to second rout,

<BR>Came furious down to be reveng'd on men,

<BR>WO TO THE INHABITANTS ON EARTH! that now,

<BR>While time was, our first Parents had bin warnd

<BR>The coming of thir secret foe, and scap'd

<BR>Haply so scap'd his mortal snare; for now

<BR>SATAN, now first inflam'd with rage, came down,

<BR>The Tempter ere th' Accuser of man-kind,

<BR>To wreck on innocent frail man his loss

<BR>Of that first Battel, and his flight to Hell:

<BR>Yet not rejoycing in his speed, though bold,

<BR>Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast,

<BR>Begins his dire attempt, which nigh the birth

<BR>Now rowling, boiles in his tumultuous brest,

<BR>And like a devillish Engine back recoiles

<BR>Upon himself; horror and doubt distract

<BR>His troubl'd thoughts, and from the bottom stirr

<BR>The Hell within him, for within him Hell

<BR>He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell

<BR>One step no more then from himself can fly

<BR>By change of place: Now conscience wakes despair

<BR>That slumberd, wakes the bitter memorie

<BR>Of what he was, what is, and what must be

<BR>Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue.

<BR>Sometimes towards EDEN which now in his view

<BR>Lay pleasant, his grievd look he fixes sad,

<BR>Sometimes towards Heav'n and the full-blazing Sun,

<BR>Which now sat high in his Meridian Towre:

<BR>Then much revolving, thus in sighs began.

<BR>O thou that with surpassing Glory crownd,

<BR>Look'st from thy sole Dominion like the God

<BR>Of this new World; at whose sight all the Starrs

<BR>Hide thir diminisht heads; to thee I call,

<BR>But with no friendly voice, and add thy name

<BR>O Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams

<BR>That bring to my remembrance from what state

<BR>I fell, how glorious once above thy Spheare;

<BR>Till Pride and worse Ambition threw me down

<BR>Warring in Heav'n against Heav'ns matchless King:

<BR>Ah wherefore! he deservd no such return

<BR>From me, whom he created what I was

<BR>In that bright eminence, and with his good

<BR>Upbraided none; nor was his service hard.

<BR>What could be less then to afford him praise,

<BR>The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks,

<BR>How due! yet all his good prov'd ill in me,

<BR>And wrought but malice; lifted up so high

<BR>I sdeind subjection, and thought one step higher

<BR>Would set me highest, and in a moment quit

<BR>The debt immense of endless gratitude,

<BR>So burthensome, still paying, still to ow;

<BR>Forgetful what from him I still receivd,

<BR>And understood not that a grateful mind

<BR>By owing owes not, but still pays, at once

<BR>Indebted and dischargd; what burden then?

<BR>O had his powerful Destiny ordaind

<BR>Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood

<BR>Then happie; no unbounded hope had rais'd

<BR>Ambition. Yet why not? som other Power

<BR>As great might have aspir'd, and me though mean

<BR>Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great

<BR>Fell not, but stand unshak'n, from within

<BR>Or from without, to all temptations arm'd.

<BR>Hadst thou the same free Will and Power to stand?

<BR>Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse,

<BR>But Heav'ns free Love dealt equally to all?

<BR>Be then his Love accurst, since love or hate,

<BR>To me alike, it deals eternal woe.

<BR>Nay curs'd be thou; since against his thy will

<BR>Chose freely what it now so justly rues.

<BR>Me miserable! which way shall I flie

<BR>Infinite wrauth, and infinite despaire?

<BR>Which way I flie is Hell; my self am Hell;

<BR>And in the lowest deep a lower deep

<BR>Still threatning to devour me opens wide,

<BR>To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heav'n.

<BR>O then at last relent: is there no place

<BR>Left for Repentance, none for Pardon left?

<BR>None left but by submission; and that word

<BR>DISDAIN forbids me, and my dread of shame

<BR>Among the spirits beneath, whom I seduc'd

<BR>With other promises and other vaunts

<BR>Then to submit, boasting I could subdue

<BR>Th' Omnipotent. Ay me, they little know

<BR>How dearly I abide that boast so vaine,

<BR>Under what torments inwardly I groane;

<BR>While they adore me on the Throne of Hell,

<BR>With Diadem and Scepter high advanc'd

<BR>The lower still I fall, onely Supream

<BR>In miserie; such joy Ambition findes.

<BR>But say I could repent and could obtaine

<BR>By Act of Grace my former state; how soon

<BR>Would highth recal high thoughts, how soon unsay

<BR>What feign'd submission swore: ease would recant

<BR>Vows made in pain, as violent and void.

<BR>For never can true reconcilement grow

<BR>Where wounds of deadly hate have peirc'd so deep:

<BR>Which would but lead me to a worse relapse

<BR>And heavier fall: so should I purchase deare

<BR>Short intermission bought with double smart.

<BR>This knows my punisher; therefore as farr

<BR>From granting hee, as I from begging peace:

<BR>All hope excluded thus, behold in stead

<BR>Of us out-cast, exil'd, his new delight,

<BR>Mankind created, and for him this World.

<BR>So farwel Hope, and with Hope farwel Fear,

<BR>Farwel Remorse: all Good to me is lost;

<BR>Evil be thou my Good; by thee at least

<BR>Divided Empire with Heav'ns King I hold

<BR>By thee, and more then half perhaps will reigne;

<BR>As Man ere long, and this new World shall know.

<BR>Thus while he spake, each passion dimm'd his face

<BR>Thrice chang'd with pale, ire, envie and despair,

<BR>Which marrd his borrow'd visage, and betraid

<BR>Him counterfet, if any eye beheld.

<BR>For heav'nly mindes from such distempers foule

<BR>Are ever cleer. Whereof hee soon aware,

<BR>Each perturbation smooth'd with outward calme,

<BR>Artificer of fraud; and was the first

<BR>That practisd falshood under saintly shew,

<BR>Deep malice to conceale, couch't with revenge:

<BR>Yet not anough had practisd to deceive

<BR>URIEL once warnd; whose eye pursu'd him down

<BR>The way he went, and on th' ASSYRIAN mount

<BR>Saw him disfigur'd, more then could befall

<BR>Spirit of happie sort: his gestures fierce

<BR>He markd and mad demeanour, then alone,

<BR>As he suppos'd, all unobserv'd, unseen.

<BR>So on he fares, and to the border comes

<BR>Of EDEN, where delicious Paradise,

<BR>Now nearer, Crowns with her enclosure green,

<BR>As with a rural mound the champain head

<BR>Of a steep wilderness, whose hairie sides

<BR>With thicket overgrown, grottesque and wilde,

<BR>Access deni'd; and over head up grew

<BR>Insuperable highth of loftiest shade,

<BR>Cedar, and Pine, and Firr, and branching Palm,

<BR>A Silvan Scene, and as the ranks ascend

<BR>Shade above shade, a woodie Theatre

<BR>Of stateliest view. Yet higher then thir tops

<BR>The verdurous wall of Paradise up sprung:

<BR>Which to our general Sire gave prospect large

<BR>Into his neather Empire neighbouring round.

<BR>And higher then that Wall a circling row

<BR>Of goodliest Trees loaden with fairest Fruit,

<BR>Blossoms and Fruits at once of golden hue

<BR>Appeerd, with gay enameld colours mixt:

<BR>On which the Sun more glad impress'd his beams

<BR>Then in fair Evening Cloud, or humid Bow,

<BR>When God hath showrd the earth; so lovely seemd

<BR>That Lantskip: And of pure now purer aire

<BR>Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires

<BR>Vernal delight and joy, able to drive

<BR>All sadness but despair: now gentle gales

<BR>Fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense

<BR>Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole

<BR>Those balmie spoiles. As when to them who saile

<BR>Beyond the CAPE OF HOPE, and now are past

<BR>MOZAMBIC, off at Sea North-East windes blow

<BR>SABEAN Odours from the spicie shoare

<BR>Of ARABIE the blest, with such delay

<BR>Well pleas'd they slack thir course, and many a League

<BR>Cheard with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles.

<BR>So entertaind those odorous sweets the Fiend

<BR>Who came thir bane, though with them better pleas'd

<BR>Then ASMODEUS with the fishie fume,

<BR>That drove him, though enamourd, from the Spouse

<BR>Of TOBITS Son, and with a vengeance sent

<BR>From MEDIA post to AEGYPT, there fast bound.

<BR>Now to th' ascent of that steep savage Hill

<BR>SATAN had journied on, pensive and slow;

<BR>But further way found none, so thick entwin'd,

<BR>As one continu'd brake, the undergrowth

<BR>Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext

<BR>All path of Man or Beast that past that way:

<BR>One Gate there onely was, and that look'd East

<BR>On th' other side: which when th' arch-fellon saw

<BR>Due entrance he disdaind, and in contempt,

<BR>At one slight bound high overleap'd all bound

<BR>Of Hill or highest Wall, and sheer within

<BR>Lights on his feet. As when a prowling Wolfe,

<BR>Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey,

<BR>Watching where Shepherds pen thir Flocks at eeve

<BR>In hurdl'd Cotes amid the field secure,

<BR>Leaps o're the fence with ease into the Fould:

<BR>Or as a Thief bent to unhoord the cash

<BR>Of some rich Burgher, whose substantial dores,

<BR>Cross-barrd and bolted fast, fear no assault,

<BR>In at the window climbes, or o're the tiles;

<BR>So clomb this first grand Thief into Gods Fould:

<BR>So since into his Church lewd Hirelings climbe.

<BR>Thence up he flew, and on the Tree of Life,

<BR>The middle Tree and highest there that grew,

<BR>Sat like a Cormorant; yet not true Life

<BR>Thereby regaind, but sat devising Death

<BR>To them who liv'd; nor on the vertue thought

<BR>Of that life-giving Plant, but only us'd

<BR>For prospect, what well us'd had bin the pledge

<BR>Of immortalitie. So little knows

<BR>Any, but God alone, to value right

<BR>The good before him, but perverts best things

<BR>To worst abuse, or to thir meanest use.

<BR>Beneath him with new wonder now he views

<BR>To all delight of human sense expos'd

<BR>In narrow room Natures whole wealth, yea more,

<BR>A Heaven on Earth, for blissful Paradise

<BR>Of God the Garden was, by him in the East

<BR>Of EDEN planted; EDEN stretchd her Line

<BR>From AURAN Eastward to the Royal Towrs

<BR>Of great SELEUCIA, built by GRECIAN Kings,

<BR>Or where the Sons of EDEN long before

<BR>Dwelt in TELASSAR: in this pleasant soile

<BR>His farr more pleasant Garden God ordaind;

<BR>Out of the fertil ground he caus'd to grow

<BR>All Trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste;

<BR>And all amid them stood the Tree of Life,

<BR>High eminent, blooming Ambrosial Fruit

<BR>Of vegetable Gold; and next to Life

<BR>Our Death the Tree of Knowledge grew fast by,

<BR>Knowledge of Good bought dear by knowing ill.

<BR>Southward through EDEN went a River large,

<BR>Nor chang'd his course, but through the shaggie hill

<BR>Pass'd underneath ingulft, for God had thrown

<BR>That Mountain as his Garden mould high rais'd

<BR>Upon the rapid current, which through veins

<BR>Of porous Earth with kindly thirst up drawn,

<BR>Rose a fresh Fountain, and with many a rill

<BR>Waterd the Garden; thence united fell

<BR>Down the steep glade, and met the neather Flood,

<BR>Which from his darksom passage now appeers,

<BR>And now divided into four main Streams,

<BR>Runs divers, wandring many a famous Realme

<BR>And Country whereof here needs no account,

<BR>But rather to tell how, if Art could tell,

<BR>How from that Saphire Fount the crisped Brooks,

<BR>Rowling on Orient Pearl and sands of Gold,

<BR>With mazie error under pendant shades

<BR>Ran Nectar, visiting each plant, and fed

<BR>Flours worthy of Paradise which not nice Art

<BR>In Beds and curious Knots, but Nature boon

<BR>Powrd forth profuse on Hill and Dale and Plaine,

<BR>Both where the morning Sun first warmly smote

<BR>The open field, and where the unpierc't shade

<BR>Imbround the noontide Bowrs: Thus was this place,

<BR>A happy rural seat of various view;

<BR>Groves whose rich Trees wept odorous Gumms and Balme,

<BR>Others whose fruit burnisht with Golden Rinde

<BR>Hung amiable, HESPERIAN Fables true,

<BR>If true, here onely, and of delicious taste:

<BR>Betwixt them Lawns, or level Downs, and Flocks

<BR>Grasing the tender herb, were interpos'd,

<BR>Or palmie hilloc, or the flourie lap

<BR>Of som irriguous Valley spread her store,

<BR>Flours of all hue, and without Thorn the Rose:

<BR>Another side, umbrageous Grots and Caves

<BR>Of coole recess, o're which the mantling Vine

<BR>Layes forth her purple Grape, and gently creeps

<BR>Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall

<BR>Down the slope hills, disperst, or in a Lake,

<BR>That to the fringed Bank with Myrtle crownd,

<BR>Her chrystall mirror holds, unite thir streams.

<BR>The Birds thir quire apply; aires, vernal aires,

<BR>Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune

<BR>The trembling leaves, while Universal PAN

<BR>Knit with the GRACES and the HOURS in dance

<BR>Led on th' Eternal Spring. Not that faire field

<BR>Of ENNA, where PROSERPIN gathring flours

<BR>Her self a fairer Floure by gloomie DIS

<BR>Was gatherd, which cost CERES all that pain

<BR>To seek her through the world; nor that sweet Grove

<BR>Of DAPHNE by ORONTES, and th' inspir'd

<BR>CASTALIAN Spring might with this Paradise

<BR>Of EDEN strive; nor that NYSEIAN Ile

<BR>Girt with the River TRITON, where old CHAM,

<BR>Whom Gentiles AMMON call and LIBYAN JOVE,

<BR>Hid AMALTHEA and her Florid Son

<BR>Young BACCHUS from his Stepdame RHEA'S eye;

<BR>Nor where ABASSIN Kings thir issue Guard,

<BR>Mount AMARA, though this by som suppos'd

<BR>True Paradise under the ETHIOP Line

<BR>By NILUS head, enclos'd with shining Rock,

<BR>A whole dayes journey high, but wide remote

<BR>From this ASSYRIAN Garden, where the Fiend

<BR>Saw undelighted all delight, all kind

<BR>Of living Creatures new to sight and strange:

<BR>Two of far nobler shape erect and tall,

<BR>Godlike erect, with native Honour clad

<BR>In naked Majestie seemd Lords of all,

<BR>And worthie seemd, for in thir looks Divine

<BR>The image of thir glorious Maker shon,

<BR>Truth, Wisdome, Sanctitude severe and pure,

<BR>Severe, but in true filial freedom plac't;

<BR>Whence true autoritie in men; though both

<BR>Not equal, as thir sex not equal seemd;

<BR>For contemplation hee and valour formd,

<BR>For softness shee and sweet attractive Grace,

<BR>Hee for God only, shee for God in him:

<BR>His fair large Front and Eye sublime declar'd

<BR>Absolute rule; and Hyacinthin Locks

<BR>Round from his parted forelock manly hung

<BR>Clustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad:

<BR>Shee as a vail down to the slender waste

<BR>Her unadorned golden tresses wore

<BR>Dissheveld, but in wanton ringlets wav'd

<BR>As the Vine curles her tendrils, which impli'd

<BR>Subjection, but requir'd with gentle sway,

<BR>And by her yeilded, by him best receivd,

<BR>Yeilded with coy submission, modest pride,

<BR>And sweet reluctant amorous delay.

<BR>Nor those mysterious parts were then conceald,

<BR>Then was not guiltie shame, dishonest shame

<BR>Of natures works, honor dishonorable,

<BR>Sin-bred, how have ye troubl'd all mankind

<BR>With shews instead, meer shews of seeming pure,

<BR>And banisht from mans life his happiest life,

<BR>Simplicitie and spotless innocence.

<BR>So passd they naked on, nor shund the sight

<BR>Of God or Angel, for they thought no ill:

<BR>So hand in hand they passd, the lovliest pair

<BR>That ever since in loves imbraces met,

<BR>ADAM the goodliest man of men since borne

<BR>His Sons, the fairest of her Daughters EVE.

<BR>Under a tuft of shade that on a green

<BR>Stood whispering soft, by a fresh Fountain side

<BR>They sat them down, and after no more toil

<BR>Of thir sweet Gardning labour then suffic'd

<BR>To recommend coole ZEPHYR, and made ease

<BR>More easie, wholsom thirst and appetite

<BR>More grateful, to thir Supper Fruits they fell,

<BR>Nectarine Fruits which the compliant boughes

<BR>Yeilded them, side-long as they sat recline

<BR>On the soft downie Bank damaskt with flours:

<BR>The savourie pulp they chew, and in the rinde

<BR>Still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream;

<BR>Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles

<BR>Wanted, nor youthful dalliance as beseems

<BR>Fair couple, linkt in happie nuptial League,

<BR>Alone as they. About them frisking playd

<BR>All Beasts of th' Earth, since wilde, and of all chase

<BR>In Wood or Wilderness, Forrest or Den;

<BR>Sporting the Lion rampd, and in his paw

<BR>Dandl'd the Kid; Bears, Tygers, Ounces, Pards

<BR>Gambold before them, th' unwieldy Elephant

<BR>To make them mirth us'd all his might, &amp; wreathd

<BR>His Lithe Proboscis; close the Serpent sly

<BR>Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine

<BR>His breaded train, and of his fatal guile

<BR>Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass

<BR>Coucht, and now fild with pasture gazing sat,

<BR>Or Bedward ruminating: for the Sun

<BR>Declin'd was hasting now with prone carreer

<BR>To th' Ocean Iles, and in th' ascending Scale

<BR>Of Heav'n the Starrs that usher Evening rose:

<BR>When SATAN still in gaze, as first he stood,

<BR>Scarce thus at length faild speech recoverd sad.

<BR>O Hell! what doe mine eyes with grief behold,

<BR>Into our room of bliss thus high advanc't

<BR>Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps,

<BR>Not Spirits, yet to heav'nly Spirits bright

<BR>Little inferior; whom my thoughts pursue

<BR>With wonder, and could love, so lively shines

<BR>In them Divine resemblance, and such grace

<BR>The hand that formd them on thir shape hath pourd.

<BR>Ah gentle pair, yee little think how nigh

<BR>Your change approaches, when all these delights

<BR>Will vanish and deliver ye to woe,

<BR>More woe, the more your taste is now of joy;

<BR>Happie, but for so happie ill secur'd

<BR>Long to continue, and this high seat your Heav'n

<BR>Ill fenc't for Heav'n to keep out such a foe

<BR>As now is enterd; yet no purpos'd foe

<BR>To you whom I could pittie thus forlorne

<BR>Though I unpittied: League with you I seek,

<BR>And mutual amitie so streight, so close,

<BR>That I with you must dwell, or you with me

<BR>Henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please

<BR>Like this fair Paradise, your sense, yet such

<BR>Accept your Makers work; he gave it me,

<BR>Which I as freely give; Hell shall unfould,

<BR>To entertain you two, her widest Gates,

<BR>And send forth all her Kings; there will be room,

<BR>Not like these narrow limits, to receive

<BR>Your numerous ofspring; if no better place,

<BR>Thank him who puts me loath to this revenge

<BR>On you who wrong me not for him who wrongd.

<BR>And should I at your harmless innocence

<BR>Melt, as I doe, yet public reason just,

<BR>Honour and Empire with revenge enlarg'd,

<BR>By conquering this new World, compels me now

<BR>To do what else though damnd I should abhorre.

<BR>So spake the Fiend, and with necessitie,

<BR>The Tyrants plea, excus'd his devilish deeds.

<BR>Then from his loftie stand on that high Tree

<BR>Down he alights among the sportful Herd

<BR>Of those fourfooted kindes, himself now one,

<BR>Now other, as thir shape servd best his end

<BR>Neerer to view his prey, and unespi'd

<BR>To mark what of thir state he more might learn

<BR>By word or action markt: about them round

<BR>A Lion now he stalkes with fierie glare,

<BR>Then as a Tiger, who by chance hath spi'd

<BR>In some Purlieu two gentle Fawnes at play,

<BR>Strait couches close, then rising changes oft

<BR>His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground

<BR>Whence rushing he might surest seise them both

<BR>Grip't in each paw: when ADAM first of men

<BR>To first of women EVE thus moving speech,

<BR>Turnd him all eare to heare new utterance flow.

<BR>Sole partner and sole part of all these joyes,

<BR>Dearer thy self then all; needs must the Power

<BR>That made us, and for us this ample World

<BR>Be infinitly good, and of his good

<BR>As liberal and free as infinite,

<BR>That rais'd us from the dust and plac't us here

<BR>In all this happiness, who at his hand

<BR>Have nothing merited, nor can performe

<BR>Aught whereof hee hath need, hee who requires

<BR>From us no other service then to keep

<BR>This one, this easie charge, of all the Trees

<BR>In Paradise that beare delicious fruit

<BR>So various, not to taste that onely Tree

<BR>Of knowledge, planted by the Tree of Life,

<BR>So neer grows Death to Life, what ere Death is,

<BR>Som dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowst

<BR>God hath pronounc't it death to taste that Tree,

<BR>The only sign of our obedience left

<BR>Among so many signes of power and rule

<BR>Conferrd upon us, and Dominion giv'n

<BR>Over all other Creatures that possesse

<BR>Earth, Aire, and Sea. Then let us not think hard

<BR>One easie prohibition, who enjoy

<BR>Free leave so large to all things else, and choice

<BR>Unlimited of manifold delights:

<BR>But let us ever praise him, and extoll

<BR>His bountie, following our delightful task

<BR>To prune these growing Plants, &amp; tend these Flours,

<BR>Which were it toilsom, yet with thee were sweet.

<BR>To whom thus Eve repli'd. O thou for whom

<BR>And from whom I was formd flesh of thy flesh,

<BR>And without whom am to no end, my Guide

<BR>And Head, what thou hast said is just and right.

<BR>For wee to him indeed all praises owe,

<BR>And daily thanks, I chiefly who enjoy

<BR>So farr the happier Lot, enjoying thee

<BR>Preeminent by so much odds, while thou

<BR>Like consort to thy self canst no where find.

<BR>That day I oft remember, when from sleep

<BR>I first awak't, and found my self repos'd

<BR>Under a shade on flours, much wondring where

<BR>And what I was, whence thither brought, and how.

<BR>Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound

<BR>Of waters issu'd from a Cave and spread

<BR>Into a liquid Plain, then stood unmov'd

<BR>Pure as th' expanse of Heav'n; I thither went

<BR>With unexperienc't thought, and laid me downe

<BR>On the green bank, to look into the cleer

<BR>Smooth Lake, that to me seemd another Skie.

<BR>As I bent down to look, just opposite,

<BR>A Shape within the watry gleam appeerd

<BR>Bending to look on me, I started back,

<BR>It started back, but pleasd I soon returnd,

<BR>Pleas'd it returnd as soon with answering looks

<BR>Of sympathie and love, there I had fixt

<BR>Mine eyes till now, and pin'd with vain desire,

<BR>Had not a voice thus warnd me, What thou seest,

<BR>What there thou seest fair Creature is thy self,

<BR>With thee it came and goes: but follow me,

<BR>And I will bring thee where no shadow staies

<BR>Thy coming, and thy soft imbraces, hee

<BR>Whose image thou art, him thou shall enjoy

<BR>Inseparablie thine, to him shalt beare

<BR>Multitudes like thy self, and thence be call'd

<BR>Mother of human Race: what could I doe,

<BR>But follow strait, invisibly thus led?

<BR>Till I espi'd thee, fair indeed and tall,

<BR>Under a Platan, yet methought less faire,

<BR>Less winning soft, less amiablie milde,

<BR>Then that smooth watry image; back I turnd,

<BR>Thou following cryd'st aloud, Return fair EVE,

<BR>Whom fli'st thou? whom thou fli'st, of him thou art,

<BR>His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent

<BR>Out of my side to thee, neerest my heart

<BR>Substantial Life, to have thee by my side

<BR>Henceforth an individual solace dear;

<BR>Part of my Soul I seek thee, and thee claim

<BR>My other half: with that thy gentle hand

<BR>Seisd mine, I yeilded, and from that time see

<BR>How beauty is excelld by manly grace

<BR>And wisdom, which alone is truly fair.

<BR>So spake our general Mother, and with eyes

<BR>Of conjugal attraction unreprov'd,

<BR>And meek surrender, half imbracing leand

<BR>On our first Father, half her swelling Breast

<BR>Naked met his under the flowing Gold

<BR>Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight

<BR>Both of her Beauty and submissive Charms

<BR>Smil'd with superior Love, as JUPITER

<BR>On JUNO smiles, when he impregns the Clouds

<BR>That shed MAY Flowers; and press'd her Matron lip

<BR>With kisses pure: aside the Devil turnd

<BR>For envie, yet with jealous leer maligne

<BR>Ey'd them askance, and to himself thus plaind.

<BR>Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two

<BR>Imparadis't in one anothers arms

<BR>The happier EDEN, shall enjoy thir fill

<BR>Of bliss on bliss, while I to Hell am thrust,

<BR>Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire,

<BR>Among our other torments not the least,

<BR>Still unfulfill'd with pain of longing pines;

<BR>Yet let me not forget what I have gain'd

<BR>From thir own mouths; all is not theirs it seems:

<BR>One fatal Tree there stands of Knowledge call'd,

<BR>Forbidden them to taste: Knowledge forbidd'n?

<BR>Suspicious, reasonless. Why should thir Lord

<BR>Envie them that? can it be sin to know,

<BR>Can it be death? and do they onely stand

<BR>By Ignorance, is that thir happie state,

<BR>The proof of thir obedience and thir faith?

<BR>O fair foundation laid whereon to build

<BR>Thir ruine! Hence I will excite thir minds

<BR>With more desire to know, and to reject

<BR>Envious commands, invented with designe

<BR>To keep them low whom knowledge might exalt

<BR>Equal with Gods; aspiring to be such,

<BR>They taste and die: what likelier can ensue?

<BR>But first with narrow search I must walk round

<BR>This Garden, and no corner leave unspi'd;

<BR>A chance but chance may lead where I may meet

<BR>Some wandring Spirit of Heav'n, by Fountain side,

<BR>Or in thick shade retir'd, from him to draw

<BR>What further would be learnt. Live while ye may,

<BR>Yet happie pair; enjoy, till I return,

<BR>Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed.

<BR>So saying, his proud step he scornful turn'd,

<BR>But with sly circumspection, and began

<BR>Through wood, through waste, o're hil, o're dale his roam.

<BR>Mean while in utmost Longitude, where Heav'n

<BR>With Earth and Ocean meets, the setting Sun

<BR>Slowly descended, and with right aspect

<BR>Against the eastern Gate of Paradise

<BR>Leveld his eevning Rayes: it was a Rock

<BR>Of Alablaster, pil'd up to the Clouds,

<BR>Conspicuous farr, winding with one ascent

<BR>Accessible from Earth, one entrance high;

<BR>The rest was craggie cliff, that overhung

<BR>Still as it rose, impossible to climbe.

<BR>Betwixt these rockie Pillars GABRIEL sat

<BR>Chief of th' Angelic Guards, awaiting night;

<BR>About him exercis'd Heroic Games

<BR>Th' unarmed Youth of Heav'n, but nigh at hand

<BR>Celestial Armourie, Shields, Helmes, and Speares

<BR>Hung high with Diamond flaming, and with Gold.

<BR>Thither came URIEL, gliding through the Eeven

<BR>On a Sun beam, swift as a shooting Starr

<BR>In AUTUMN thwarts the night, when vapors fir'd

<BR>Impress the Air, and shews the Mariner

<BR>From what point of his Compass to beware

<BR>Impetuous winds: he thus began in haste.

<BR>GABRIEL, to thee thy cours by Lot hath giv'n

<BR>Charge and strict watch that to this happie place

<BR>No evil thing approach or enter in;

<BR>This day at highth of Noon came to my Spheare

<BR>A Spirit, zealous, as he seem'd, to know

<BR>More of th' Almighties works, and chiefly Man

<BR>Gods latest Image: I describ'd his way

<BR>Bent all on speed, and markt his Aerie Gate;

<BR>But in the Mount that lies from EDEN North,

<BR>Where he first lighted, soon discernd his looks

<BR>Alien from Heav'n, with passions foul obscur'd:

<BR>Mine eye pursu'd him still, but under shade

<BR>Lost sight of him; one of the banisht crew

<BR>I fear, hath ventur'd from the deep, to raise

<BR>New troubles; him thy care must be to find.

<BR>To whom the winged Warriour thus returnd:

<BR>URIEL, no wonder if thy perfet sight,

<BR>Amid the Suns bright circle where thou sitst,

<BR>See farr and wide: in at this Gate none pass

<BR>The vigilance here plac't, but such as come

<BR>Well known from Heav'n; and since Meridian hour

<BR>No Creature thence: if Spirit of other sort,

<BR>So minded, have oreleapt these earthie bounds

<BR>On purpose, hard thou knowst it to exclude

<BR>Spiritual substance with corporeal barr.

<BR>But if within the circuit of these walks

<BR>In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom

<BR>Thou telst, by morrow dawning I shall know.

<BR>So promis'd hee, and URIEL to his charge

<BR>Returnd on that bright beam, whose point now raisd

<BR>Bore him slope downward to the Sun now fall'n

<BR>Beneath th' AZORES; whither the prime Orb,

<BR>Incredible how swift, had thither rowl'd

<BR>Diurnal, or this less volubil Earth

<BR>By shorter flight to th' East, had left him there

<BR>Arraying with reflected Purple and Gold

<BR>The Clouds that on his Western Throne attend:

<BR>Now came still Eevning on, and Twilight gray

<BR>Had in her sober Liverie all things clad;

<BR>Silence accompanied, for Beast and Bird,

<BR>They to thir grassie Couch, these to thir Nests

<BR>Were slunk, all but the wakeful Nightingale;

<BR>She all night long her amorous descant sung;

<BR>Silence was pleas'd: now glow'd the Firmament

<BR>With living Saphirs: HESPERUS that led

<BR>The starrie Host, rode brightest, till the Moon

<BR>Rising in clouded Majestie, at length

<BR>Apparent Queen unvaild her peerless light,

<BR>And o're the dark her Silver Mantle threw.

<BR>When ADAM thus to EVE: Fair Consort, th' hour

<BR>Of night, and all things now retir'd to rest

<BR>Mind us of like repose, since God hath set

<BR>Labour and rest, as day and night to men

<BR>Successive, and the timely dew of sleep

<BR>Now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines

<BR>Our eye-lids; other Creatures all day long

<BR>Rove idle unimploid, and less need rest;

<BR>Man hath his daily work of body or mind

<BR>Appointed, which declares his Dignitie,

<BR>And the regard of Heav'n on all his waies;

<BR>While other Animals unactive range,

<BR>And of thir doings God takes no account.

<BR>Tomorrow ere fresh Morning streak the East

<BR>With first approach of light, we must be ris'n,

<BR>And at our pleasant labour, to reform

<BR>Yon flourie Arbors, yonder Allies green,

<BR>Our walks at noon, with branches overgrown,

<BR>That mock our scant manuring, and require

<BR>More hands then ours to lop thir wanton growth:

<BR>Those Blossoms also, and those dropping Gumms,

<BR>That lie bestrowne unsightly and unsmooth,

<BR>Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease;

<BR>Mean while, as Nature wills, Night bids us rest.

<BR>To whom thus EVE with perfet beauty adornd.

<BR>My Author and Disposer, what thou bidst

<BR>Unargu'd I obey; so God ordains,

<BR>God is thy Law, thou mine: to know no more

<BR>Is womans happiest knowledge and her praise.

<BR>With thee conversing I forget all time,

<BR>All seasons and thir change, all please alike.

<BR>Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet,

<BR>With charm of earliest Birds; pleasant the Sun

<BR>When first on this delightful Land he spreads

<BR>His orient Beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flour,

<BR>Glistring with dew; fragrant the fertil earth

<BR>After soft showers; and sweet the coming on

<BR>Of grateful Eevning milde, then silent Night

<BR>With this her solemn Bird and this fair Moon,

<BR>And these the Gemms of Heav'n, her starrie train:

<BR>But neither breath of Morn when she ascends

<BR>With charm of earliest Birds, nor rising Sun

<BR>On this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, floure,

<BR>Glistring with dew, nor fragrance after showers,

<BR>Nor grateful Evening mild, nor silent Night

<BR>With this her solemn Bird, nor walk by Moon,

<BR>Or glittering Starr-light without thee is sweet.

<BR>But wherfore all night long shine these, for whom

<BR>This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes?

<BR>To whom our general Ancestor repli'd.

<BR>Daughter of God and Man, accomplisht EVE,

<BR>Those have thir course to finish, round the Earth,

<BR>By morrow Eevning, and from Land to Land

<BR>In order, though to Nations yet unborn,

<BR>Ministring light prepar'd, they set and rise;

<BR>Least total darkness should by Night regaine

<BR>Her old possession, and extinguish life

<BR>In Nature and all things, which these soft fires

<BR>Not only enlighten, but with kindly heate

<BR>Of various influence foment and warme,

<BR>Temper or nourish, or in part shed down

<BR>Thir stellar vertue on all kinds that grow

<BR>On Earth, made hereby apter to receive

<BR>Perfection from the Suns more potent Ray.

<BR>These then, though unbeheld in deep of night,

<BR>Shine not in vain, nor think, though men were none,

<BR>That heav'n would want spectators, God want praise;

<BR>Millions of spiritual Creatures walk the Earth

<BR>Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep:

<BR>All these with ceasless praise his works behold

<BR>Both day and night: how often from the steep

<BR>Of echoing Hill or Thicket have we heard

<BR>Celestial voices to the midnight air,

<BR>Sole, or responsive each to others note

<BR>Singing thir great Creator: oft in bands

<BR>While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk

<BR>With Heav'nly touch of instrumental sounds

<BR>In full harmonic number joind, thir songs

<BR>Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven.

<BR>Thus talking hand in hand alone they pass'd

<BR>On to thir blissful Bower; it was a place

<BR>Chos'n by the sovran Planter, when he fram'd

<BR>All things to mans delightful use; the roofe

<BR>Of thickest covert was inwoven shade

<BR>Laurel and Mirtle, and what higher grew

<BR>Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side

<BR>ACANTHUS, and each odorous bushie shrub

<BR>Fenc'd up the verdant wall; each beauteous flour,

<BR>IRIS all hues, Roses, and Gessamin

<BR>Rear'd high thir flourisht heads between, and wrought

<BR>Mosaic; underfoot the Violet,

<BR>Crocus, and Hyacinth with rich inlay

<BR>Broiderd the ground, more colour'd then with stone

<BR>Of costliest Emblem: other Creature here

<BR>Beast, Bird, Insect, or Worm durst enter none;

<BR>Such was thir awe of man. In shadier Bower

<BR>More sacred and sequesterd, though but feignd,

<BR>PAN or SILVANUS never slept, nor Nymph,

<BR>Nor FAUNUS haunted. Here in close recess

<BR>With Flowers, Garlands, and sweet-smelling Herbs

<BR>Espoused EVE deckt first her Nuptial Bed,

<BR>And heav'nly Quires the Hymenaean sung,

<BR>What day the genial Angel to our Sire

<BR>Brought her in naked beauty more adorn'd,

<BR>More lovely then PANDORA, whom the Gods

<BR>Endowd with all thir gifts, and O too like

<BR>In sad event, when to the unwiser Son

<BR>Of JAPHET brought by HERMES, she ensnar'd

<BR>Mankind with her faire looks, to be aveng'd

<BR>On him who had stole JOVES authentic fire.

<BR>Thus at thir shadie Lodge arriv'd, both stood,

<BR>Both turnd, and under op'n Skie ador'd

<BR>The God that made both Skie, Air, Earth &amp; Heav'n

<BR>Which they beheld, the Moons resplendent Globe

<BR>And starrie Pole: Thou also mad'st the Night,

<BR>Maker Omnipotent, and thou the Day,

<BR>Which we in our appointed work imployd

<BR>Have finisht happie in our mutual help

<BR>And mutual love, the Crown of all our bliss

<BR>Ordain'd by thee, and this delicious place

<BR>For us too large, where thy abundance wants

<BR>Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground.

<BR>But thou hast promis'd from us two a Race

<BR>To fill the Earth, who shall with us extoll

<BR>Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake,

<BR>And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep.

<BR>This said unanimous, and other Rites

<BR>Observing none, but adoration pure

<BR>Which God likes best, into thir inmost bower

<BR>Handed they went; and eas'd the putting off

<BR>These troublesom disguises which wee wear,

<BR>Strait side by side were laid, nor turnd I weene

<BR>ADAM from his fair Spouse, nor EVE the Rites

<BR>Mysterious of connubial Love refus'd:

<BR>Whatever Hypocrites austerely talk

<BR>Of puritie and place and innocence,

<BR>Defaming as impure what God declares

<BR>Pure, and commands to som, leaves free to all.

<BR>Our Maker bids increase, who bids abstain

<BR>But our Destroyer, foe to God and Man?

<BR>Haile wedded Love, mysterious Law, true source

<BR>Of human ofspring, sole proprietie,

<BR>In Paradise of all things common else.

<BR>By thee adulterous lust was driv'n from men

<BR>Among the bestial herds to raunge, by thee

<BR>Founded in Reason, Loyal, Just, and Pure,

<BR>Relations dear, and all the Charities

<BR>Of Father, Son, and Brother first were known.

<BR>Farr be it, that I should write thee sin or blame,

<BR>Or think thee unbefitting holiest place,

<BR>Perpetual Fountain of Domestic sweets,

<BR>Whose Bed is undefil'd and chast pronounc't,

<BR>Present, or past, as Saints and Patriarchs us'd.

<BR>Here Love his golden shafts imploies, here lights

<BR>His constant Lamp, and waves his purple wings,

<BR>Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile

<BR>Of Harlots, loveless, joyless, unindeard,

<BR>Casual fruition, nor in Court Amours

<BR>Mixt Dance, or wanton Mask, or Midnight Bal,

<BR>Or Serenate, which the starv'd Lover sings

<BR>To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain.

<BR>These lulld by Nightingales imbraceing slept,

<BR>And on thir naked limbs the flourie roof

<BR>Showrd Roses, which the Morn repair'd. Sleep on,

<BR>Blest pair; and O yet happiest if ye seek

<BR>No happier state, and know to know no more.

<BR>Now had night measur'd with her shaddowie Cone

<BR>Half way up Hill this vast Sublunar Vault,

<BR>And from thir Ivorie Port the Cherubim

<BR>Forth issuing at th' accustomd hour stood armd

<BR>To thir night watches in warlike Parade,

<BR>When GABRIEL to his next in power thus spake.

<BR>UZZIEL, half these draw off, and coast the South

<BR>With strictest watch; these other wheel the North,

<BR>Our circuit meets full West. As flame they part

<BR>Half wheeling to the Shield, half to the Spear.

<BR>From these, two strong and suttle Spirits he calld

<BR>That neer him stood, and gave them thus in charge.

<BR>ITHURIEL and ZEPHON, with wingd speed

<BR>Search through this Garden, leav unsearcht no nook,

<BR>But chiefly where those two fair Creatures Lodge,

<BR>Now laid perhaps asleep secure of harme.

<BR>This Eevning from the Sun's decline arriv'd

<BR>Who tells of som infernal Spirit seen

<BR>Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escap'd

<BR>The barrs of Hell, on errand bad no doubt:

<BR>Such where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring.

<BR>So saying, on he led his radiant Files,

<BR>Daz'ling the Moon; these to the Bower direct

<BR>In search of whom they sought: him there they found

<BR>Squat like a Toad, close at the eare of EVE;

<BR>Assaying by his Devilish art to reach

<BR>The Organs of her Fancie, and with them forge

<BR>Illusions as he list, Phantasms and Dreams,

<BR>Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint

<BR>Th' animal Spirits that from pure blood arise

<BR>Like gentle breaths from Rivers pure, thence raise

<BR>At least distemperd, discontented thoughts,

<BR>Vain hopes, vain aimes, inordinate desires

<BR>Blown up with high conceits ingendring pride.

<BR>Him thus intent ITHURIEL with his Spear

<BR>Touch'd lightly; for no falshood can endure

<BR>Touch of Celestial temper, but returns

<BR>Of force to its own likeness: up he starts

<BR>Discoverd and surpriz'd. As when a spark

<BR>Lights on a heap of nitrous Powder, laid

<BR>Fit for the Tun som Magazin to store

<BR>Against a rumord Warr, the Smuttie graine

<BR>With sudden blaze diffus'd, inflames the Aire:

<BR>So started up in his own shape the Fiend.

<BR>Back stept those two fair Angels half amaz'd

<BR>So sudden to behold the grieslie King;

<BR>Yet thus, unmovd with fear, accost him soon.

<BR>Which of those rebell Spirits adjudg'd to Hell

<BR>Com'st thou, escap'd thy prison, and transform'd,

<BR>Why satst thou like an enemie in waite

<BR>Here watching at the head of these that sleep?

<BR>Know ye not then said SATAN, filld with scorn,

<BR>Know ye not me? ye knew me once no mate

<BR>For you, there sitting where ye durst not soare;

<BR>Not to know mee argues your selves unknown,

<BR>The lowest of your throng; or if ye know,

<BR>Why ask ye, and superfluous begin

<BR>Your message, like to end as much in vain?

<BR>To whom thus ZEPHON, answering scorn with scorn.

<BR>Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same,

<BR>Or undiminisht brightness, to be known

<BR>As when thou stoodst in Heav'n upright and pure;

<BR>That Glorie then, when thou no more wast good,

<BR>Departed from thee, and thou resembl'st now

<BR>Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule.

<BR>But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account

<BR>To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep

<BR>This place inviolable, and these from harm.

<BR>So spake the Cherube, and his grave rebuke

<BR>Severe in youthful beautie, added grace

<BR>Invincible: abasht the Devil stood,

<BR>And felt how awful goodness is, and saw

<BR>Vertue in her shape how lovly, saw, and pin'd

<BR>His loss; but chiefly to find here observd

<BR>His lustre visibly impar'd; yet seemd

<BR>Undaunted. If I must contend, said he,

<BR>Best with the best, the Sender not the sent,

<BR>Or all at once; more glorie will be wonn,

<BR>Or less be lost. Thy fear, said ZEPHON bold,

<BR>Will save us trial what the least can doe

<BR>Single against thee wicked, and thence weak.

<BR>The Fiend repli'd not, overcome with rage;

<BR>But like a proud Steed reind, went hautie on,

<BR>Chaumping his iron curb: to strive or flie

<BR>He held it vain; awe from above had quelld

<BR>His heart, not else dismai'd. Now drew they nigh

<BR>The western point, where those half-rounding guards

<BR>Just met, &amp; closing stood in squadron joind

<BR>Awaiting next command. To whom thir Chief

<BR>GABRIEL from the Front thus calld aloud.

<BR>O friends, I hear the tread of nimble feet

<BR>Hasting this way, and now by glimps discerne

<BR>ITHURIEL and ZEPHON through the shade,

<BR>And with them comes a third of Regal port,

<BR>But faded splendor wan; who by his gate

<BR>And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell,

<BR>Not likely to part hence without contest;

<BR>Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours.

<BR>He scarce had ended, when those two approachd

<BR>And brief related whom they brought, wher found,

<BR>How busied, in what form and posture coucht.

<BR>To whom with stern regard thus GABRIEL spake.

<BR>Why hast thou, SATAN, broke the bounds prescrib'd

<BR>To thy transgressions, and disturbd the charge

<BR>Of others, who approve not to transgress

<BR>By thy example, but have power and right

<BR>To question thy bold entrance on this place;

<BR>Imploi'd it seems to violate sleep, and those

<BR>Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss?

<BR>To whom thus SATAN with contemptuous brow.

<BR>GABRIEL, thou hadst in Heav'n th' esteem of wise,

<BR>And such I held thee; but this question askt

<BR>Puts me in doubt. Lives ther who loves his pain?

<BR>Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell,

<BR>Though thither doomd? Thou wouldst thy self, no doubt,

<BR>And boldly venture to whatever place

<BR>Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change

<BR>Torment with ease, &amp; soonest recompence

<BR>Dole with delight, which in this place I sought;

<BR>To thee no reason; who knowst only good,

<BR>But evil hast not tri'd: and wilt object

<BR>His will who bound us? let him surer barr

<BR>His Iron Gates, if he intends our stay

<BR>In that dark durance: thus much what was askt.

<BR>The rest is true, they found me where they say;

<BR>But that implies not violence or harme.

<BR>Thus hee in scorn. The warlike Angel mov'd,

<BR>Disdainfully half smiling thus repli'd.

<BR>O loss of one in Heav'n to judge of wise,

<BR>Since SATAN fell, whom follie overthrew,

<BR>And now returns him from his prison scap't,

<BR>Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise

<BR>Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither

<BR>Unlicenc't from his bounds in Hell prescrib'd;

<BR>So wise he judges it to fly from pain

<BR>However, and to scape his punishment.

<BR>So judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth,

<BR>Which thou incurr'st by flying, meet thy flight

<BR>Seavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell,

<BR>Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain

<BR>Can equal anger infinite provok't.

<BR>But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee

<BR>Came not all Hell broke loose? is pain to them

<BR>Less pain, less to be fled, or thou then they

<BR>Less hardie to endure? courageous Chief,

<BR>The first in flight from pain, had'st thou alleg'd

<BR>To thy deserted host this cause of flight,

<BR>Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive.

<BR>To which the Fiend thus answerd frowning stern.

<BR>Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain,

<BR>Insulting Angel, well thou knowst I stood

<BR>Thy fiercest, when in Battel to thy aide

<BR>The blasting volied Thunder made all speed

<BR>And seconded thy else not dreaded Spear.

<BR>But still thy words at random, as before,

<BR>Argue thy inexperience what behooves

<BR>From hard assaies and ill successes past

<BR>A faithful Leader, not to hazard all

<BR>Through wayes of danger by himself untri'd.

<BR>I therefore, I alone first undertook

<BR>To wing the desolate Abyss, and spie

<BR>This new created World, whereof in Hell

<BR>Fame is not silent, here in hope to find

<BR>Better abode, and my afflicted Powers

<BR>To settle here on Earth, or in mid Aire;

<BR>Though for possession put to try once more

<BR>What thou and thy gay Legions dare against;

<BR>Whose easier business were to serve thir Lord

<BR>High up in Heav'n, with songs to hymne his Throne,

<BR>And practis'd distances to cringe, not fight.

<BR>To whom the warriour Angel soon repli'd.

<BR>To say and strait unsay, pretending first

<BR>Wise to flie pain, professing next the Spie,

<BR>Argues no Leader, but a lyar trac't,

<BR>SATAN, and couldst thou faithful add? O name,

<BR>O sacred name of faithfulness profan'd!

<BR>Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew?

<BR>Armie of Fiends, fit body to fit head;

<BR>Was this your discipline and faith ingag'd,

<BR>Your military obedience, to dissolve

<BR>Allegeance to th' acknowledg'd Power supream?

<BR>And thou sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem

<BR>Patron of liberty, who more then thou

<BR>Once fawn'd, and cring'd, and servilly ador'd

<BR>Heav'ns awful Monarch? wherefore but in hope

<BR>To dispossess him, and thy self to reigne?

<BR>But mark what I arreede thee now, avant;

<BR>Flie thither whence thou fledst: if from this houre

<BR>Within these hallowd limits thou appeer,

<BR>Back to th' infernal pit I drag thee chaind,

<BR>And Seale thee so, as henceforth not to scorne

<BR>The facil gates of hell too slightly barrd.

<BR>So threatn'd hee, but SATAN to no threats

<BR>Gave heed, but waxing more in rage repli'd.

<BR>Then when I am thy captive talk of chaines,

<BR>Proud limitarie Cherube, but ere then

<BR>Farr heavier load thy self expect to feel

<BR>From my prevailing arme, though Heavens King

<BR>Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy Compeers,

<BR>Us'd to the yoak, draw'st his triumphant wheels

<BR>In progress through the rode of Heav'n Star-pav'd.

<BR>While thus he spake, th' Angelic Squadron bright

<BR>Turnd fierie red, sharpning in mooned hornes

<BR>Thir Phalanx, and began to hemm him round

<BR>With ported Spears, as thick as when a field

<BR>Of CERES ripe for harvest waving bends

<BR>Her bearded Grove of ears, which way the wind

<BR>Swayes them; the careful Plowman doubting stands

<BR>Least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves

<BR>Prove chaff. On th' other side SATAN allarm'd

<BR>Collecting all his might dilated stood,

<BR>Like TENERIFF or ATLAS unremov'd:

<BR>His stature reacht the Skie, and on his Crest

<BR>Sat horror Plum'd; nor wanted in his graspe

<BR>What seemd both Spear and Shield: now dreadful deeds

<BR>Might have ensu'd, nor onely Paradise

<BR>In this commotion, but the Starrie Cope

<BR>Of Heav'n perhaps, or all the Elements

<BR>At least had gon to rack, disturbd and torne

<BR>With violence of this conflict, had not soon

<BR>Th' Eternal to prevent such horrid fray

<BR>Hung forth in Heav'n his golden Scales, yet seen

<BR>Betwixt ASTREA and the SCORPION signe,

<BR>Wherein all things created first he weighd,

<BR>The pendulous round Earth with ballanc't Aire

<BR>In counterpoise, now ponders all events,

<BR>Battels and Realms: in these he put two weights

<BR>The sequel each of parting and of fight;

<BR>The latter quick up flew, and kickt the beam;

<BR>Which GABRIEL spying, thus bespake the Fiend.

<BR>SATAN, I know thy strength, and thou knowst mine,

<BR>Neither our own but giv'n; what follie then

<BR>To boast what Arms can doe, since thine no more

<BR>Then Heav'n permits, nor mine, though doubld now

<BR>To trample thee as mire: for proof look up,

<BR>And read thy Lot in yon celestial Sign

<BR>Where thou art weigh'd, &amp; shown how light, how weak,

<BR>If thou resist. The Fiend lookt up and knew

<BR>His mounted scale aloft: nor more; but fled

<BR>Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Now Morn her rosie steps in th' Eastern Clime

<BR>Advancing, sow'd the Earth with Orient Pearle,

<BR>When ADAM wak't, so customd, for his sleep

<BR>Was Aerie light, from pure digestion bred,

<BR>And temperat vapors bland, which th' only sound

<BR>Of leaves and fuming rills, AURORA's fan,

<BR>Lightly dispers'd, and the shrill Matin Song

<BR>Of Birds on every bough; so much the more

<BR>His wonder was to find unwak'nd EVE

<BR>With Tresses discompos'd, and glowing Cheek,

<BR>As through unquiet rest: he on his side

<BR>Leaning half-rais'd, with looks of cordial Love

<BR>Hung over her enamour'd, and beheld

<BR>Beautie, which whether waking or asleep,

<BR>Shot forth peculiar Graces; then with voice

<BR>Milde, as when ZEPHYRUS on FLORA breathes,

<BR>Her hand soft touching, whisperd thus. Awake

<BR>My fairest, my espous'd, my latest found,

<BR>Heav'ns last best gift, my ever new delight,

<BR>Awake, the morning shines, and the fresh field

<BR>Calls us, we lose the prime, to mark how spring

<BR>Our tended Plants, how blows the Citron Grove,

<BR>What drops the Myrrhe, &amp; what the balmie Reed,

<BR>How Nature paints her colours, how the Bee

<BR>Sits on the Bloom extracting liquid sweet.

<BR>Such whispering wak'd her, but with startl'd eye

<BR>On ADAM, whom imbracing, thus she spake.

<BR>O Sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,

<BR>My Glorie, my Perfection, glad I see

<BR>Thy face, and Morn return'd, for I this Night,

<BR>Such night till this I never pass'd, have dream'd,

<BR>If dream'd, not as I oft am wont, of thee,

<BR>Works of day pass't, or morrows next designe,

<BR>But of offence and trouble, which my mind

<BR>Knew never till this irksom night; methought

<BR>Close at mine ear one call'd me forth to walk

<BR>With gentle voice, I thought it thine; it said,

<BR>Why sleepst thou EVE? now is the pleasant time,

<BR>The cool, the silent, save where silence yields

<BR>To the night-warbling Bird, that now awake

<BR>Tunes sweetest his love-labor'd song; now reignes

<BR>Full Orb'd the Moon, and with more pleasing light

<BR>Shadowie sets off the face of things; in vain,

<BR>If none regard; Heav'n wakes with all his eyes,

<BR>Whom to behold but thee, Natures desire,

<BR>In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment

<BR>Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze.

<BR>I rose as at thy call, but found thee not;

<BR>To find thee I directed then my walk;

<BR>And on, methought, alone I pass'd through ways

<BR>That brought me on a sudden to the Tree

<BR>Of interdicted Knowledge: fair it seem'd,

<BR>Much fairer to my Fancie then by day:

<BR>And as I wondring lookt, beside it stood

<BR>One shap'd &amp; wing'd like one of those from Heav'n

<BR>By us oft seen; his dewie locks distill'd

<BR>Ambrosia; on that Tree he also gaz'd;

<BR>And O fair Plant, said he, with fruit surcharg'd,

<BR>Deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet,

<BR>Nor God, nor Man; is Knowledge so despis'd?

<BR>Or envie, or what reserve forbids to taste?

<BR>Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold

<BR>Longer thy offerd good, why else set here?

<BR>This said he paus'd not, but with ventrous Arme

<BR>He pluckt, he tasted; mee damp horror chil'd

<BR>At such bold words voucht with a deed so bold:

<BR>But he thus overjoy'd, O Fruit Divine,

<BR>Sweet of thy self, but much more sweet thus cropt,

<BR>Forbidd'n here, it seems, as onely fit

<BR>For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men:

<BR>And why not Gods of Men, since good, the more

<BR>Communicated, more abundant growes,

<BR>The Author not impair'd, but honourd more?

<BR>Here, happie Creature, fair Angelic EVE,

<BR>Partake thou also; happie though thou art,

<BR>Happier thou mayst be, worthier canst not be:

<BR>Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods

<BR>Thy self a Goddess, not to Earth confind,

<BR>But somtimes in the Air, as wee, somtimes

<BR>Ascend to Heav'n, by merit thine, and see

<BR>What life the Gods live there, and such live thou.

<BR>So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held,

<BR>Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part

<BR>Which he had pluckt; the pleasant savourie smell

<BR>So quick'nd appetite, that I, methought,

<BR>Could not but taste. Forthwith up to the Clouds

<BR>With him I flew, and underneath beheld

<BR>The Earth outstretcht immense, a prospect wide

<BR>And various: wondring at my flight and change

<BR>To this high exaltation; suddenly

<BR>My Guide was gon, and I, me thought, sunk down,

<BR>And fell asleep; but O how glad I wak'd

<BR>To find this but a dream! Thus EVE her Night

<BR>Related, and thus ADAM answerd sad.

<BR>Best Image of my self and dearer half,

<BR>The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep

<BR>Affects me equally; nor can I like

<BR>This uncouth dream, of evil sprung I fear;

<BR>Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none,

<BR>Created pure. But know that in the Soule

<BR>Are many lesser Faculties that serve

<BR>Reason as chief; among these Fansie next

<BR>Her office holds; of all external things,

<BR>Which the five watchful Senses represent,

<BR>She forms Imaginations, Aerie shapes,

<BR>Which Reason joyning or disjoyning, frames

<BR>All what we affirm or what deny, and call

<BR>Our knowledge or opinion; then retires

<BR>Into her private Cell when Nature rests.

<BR>Oft in her absence mimic Fansie wakes

<BR>To imitate her; but misjoyning shapes,

<BR>Wilde work produces oft, and most in dreams,

<BR>Ill matching words and deeds long past or late.

<BR>Som such resemblances methinks I find

<BR>Of our last Eevnings talk, in this thy dream,

<BR>But with addition strange; yet be not sad.

<BR>Evil into the mind of God or Man

<BR>May come and go, so unapprov'd, and leave

<BR>No spot or blame behind: Which gives me hope

<BR>That what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream,

<BR>Waking thou never wilt consent to do.

<BR>Be not disheart'nd then, nor cloud those looks

<BR>That wont to be more chearful and serene

<BR>Then when fair Morning first smiles on the World,

<BR>And let us to our fresh imployments rise

<BR>Among the Groves, the Fountains, and the Flours

<BR>That open now thir choicest bosom'd smells

<BR>Reservd from night, and kept for thee in store.

<BR>So cheard he his fair Spouse, and she was cheard,

<BR>But silently a gentle tear let fall

<BR>From either eye, and wip'd them with her haire;

<BR>Two other precious drops that ready stood,

<BR>Each in thir chrystal sluce, hee ere they fell

<BR>Kiss'd as the gracious signs of sweet remorse

<BR>And pious awe, that feard to have offended.

<BR>So all was cleard, and to the Field they haste.

<BR>But first from under shadie arborous roof,

<BR>Soon as they forth were come to open sight

<BR>Of day-spring, and the Sun, who scarce up risen

<BR>With wheels yet hov'ring o're the Ocean brim,

<BR>Shot paralel to the earth his dewie ray,

<BR>Discovering in wide Lantskip all the East

<BR>Of Paradise and EDENS happie Plains,

<BR>Lowly they bow'd adoring, and began

<BR>Thir Orisons, each Morning duly paid

<BR>In various style, for neither various style

<BR>Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise

<BR>Thir Maker, in fit strains pronounc't or sung

<BR>Unmeditated, such prompt eloquence

<BR>Flowd from thir lips, in Prose or numerous Verse,

<BR>More tuneable then needed Lute or Harp

<BR>To add more sweetness, and they thus began.

<BR>These are thy glorious works, Parent of good,

<BR>Almightie, thine this universal Frame,

<BR>Thus wondrous fair; thy self how wondrous then!

<BR>Unspeakable, who sitst above these Heavens

<BR>To us invisible or dimly seen

<BR>In these thy lowest works, yet these declare

<BR>Thy goodness beyond thought, and Power Divine:

<BR>Speak yee who best can tell, ye Sons of light,

<BR>Angels, for yee behold him, and with songs

<BR>And choral symphonies, Day without Night,

<BR>Circle his Throne rejoycing, yee in Heav'n,

<BR>On Earth joyn all yee Creatures to extoll

<BR>Him first, him last, him midst, and without end.

<BR>Fairest of Starrs, last in the train of Night,

<BR>If better thou belong not to the dawn,

<BR>Sure pledge of day, that crownst the smiling Morn

<BR>With thy bright Circlet, praise him in thy Spheare

<BR>While day arises, that sweet hour of Prime.

<BR>Thou Sun, of this great World both Eye and Soule,

<BR>Acknowledge him thy Greater, sound his praise

<BR>In thy eternal course, both when thou climb'st,

<BR>And when high Noon hast gaind, &amp; when thou fallst.

<BR>Moon, that now meetst the orient Sun, now fli'st

<BR>With the fixt Starrs, fixt in thir Orb that flies,

<BR>And yee five other wandring Fires that move

<BR>In mystic Dance not without Song, resound

<BR>His praise, who out of Darkness call'd up Light.

<BR>Aire, and ye Elements the eldest birth

<BR>Of Natures Womb, that in quaternion run

<BR>Perpetual Circle, multiform; and mix

<BR>And nourish all things, let your ceasless change

<BR>Varie to our great Maker still new praise.

<BR>Ye Mists and Exhalations that now rise

<BR>From Hill or steaming Lake, duskie or grey,

<BR>Till the Sun paint your fleecie skirts with Gold,

<BR>In honour to the Worlds great Author rise,

<BR>Whether to deck with Clouds the uncolourd skie,

<BR>Or wet the thirstie Earth with falling showers,

<BR>Rising or falling still advance his praise.

<BR>His praise ye Winds, that from four Quarters blow,

<BR>Breath soft or loud; and wave your tops, ye Pines,

<BR>With every Plant, in sign of Worship wave.

<BR>Fountains and yee, that warble, as ye flow,

<BR>Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.

<BR>Joyn voices all ye living Souls, ye Birds,

<BR>That singing up to Heaven Gate ascend,

<BR>Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise;

<BR>Yee that in Waters glide, and yee that walk

<BR>The Earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;

<BR>Witness if I be silent, Morn or Eeven,

<BR>To Hill, or Valley, Fountain, or fresh shade

<BR>Made vocal by my Song, and taught his praise.

<BR>Hail universal Lord, be bounteous still

<BR>To give us onely good; and if the night

<BR>Have gathered aught of evil or conceald,

<BR>Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark.

<BR>So pray'd they innocent, and to thir thoughts

<BR>Firm peace recoverd soon and wonted calm.

<BR>On to thir mornings rural work they haste

<BR>Among sweet dewes and flours; where any row

<BR>Of Fruit-trees overwoodie reachd too farr

<BR>Thir pamperd boughes, and needed hands to check

<BR>Fruitless imbraces: or they led the Vine

<BR>To wed her Elm; she spous'd about him twines

<BR>Her mariageable arms, and with her brings

<BR>Her dowr th' adopted Clusters, to adorn

<BR>His barren leaves. Them thus imploid beheld

<BR>With pittie Heav'ns high King, and to him call'd

<BR>RAPHAEL, the sociable Spirit, that deign'd

<BR>To travel with TOBIAS, and secur'd

<BR>His marriage with the seaventimes-wedded Maid.

<BR>RAPHAEL, said hee, thou hear'st what stir on Earth

<BR>SATAN from Hell scap't through the darksom Gulf

<BR>Hath raisd in Paradise, and how disturbd

<BR>This night the human pair, how he designes

<BR>In them at once to ruin all mankind.

<BR>Go therefore, half this day as friend with friend

<BR>Converse with ADAM, in what Bowre or shade

<BR>Thou find'st him from the heat of Noon retir'd,

<BR>To respit his day-labour with repast,

<BR>Or with repose; and such discourse bring on,

<BR>As may advise him of his happie state,

<BR>Happiness in his power left free to will,

<BR>Left to his own free Will, his Will though free,

<BR>Yet mutable; whence warne him to beware

<BR>He swerve not too secure: tell him withall

<BR>His danger, and from whom, what enemie

<BR>Late falln himself from Heav'n, is plotting now

<BR>The fall of others from like state of bliss;

<BR>By violence, no, for that shall be withstood,

<BR>But by deceit and lies; this let him know,

<BR>Least wilfully transgressing he pretend

<BR>Surprisal, unadmonisht, unforewarnd.

<BR>So spake th' Eternal Father, and fulfilld

<BR>All Justice: nor delaid the winged Saint

<BR>After his charge receivd, but from among

<BR>Thousand Celestial Ardors, where he stood

<BR>Vaild with his gorgeous wings, up springing light

<BR>Flew through the midst of Heav'n; th' angelic Quires

<BR>On each hand parting, to his speed gave way

<BR>Through all th' Empyreal road; till at the Gate

<BR>Of Heav'n arriv'd, the gate self-opend wide

<BR>On golden Hinges turning, as by work

<BR>Divine the sov'ran Architect had fram'd.

<BR>From hence, no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight,

<BR>Starr interpos'd, however small he sees,

<BR>Not unconform to other shining Globes,

<BR>Earth and the Gard'n of God, with Cedars crownd

<BR>Above all Hills. As when by night the Glass

<BR>Of GALILEO, less assur'd, observes

<BR>Imagind Lands and Regions in the Moon:

<BR>Or Pilot from amidst the CYCLADES

<BR>DELOS or SAMOS first appeering kenns

<BR>A cloudy spot. Down thither prone in flight

<BR>He speeds, and through the vast Ethereal Skie

<BR>Sailes between worlds &amp; worlds, with steddie wing

<BR>Now on the polar windes, then with quick Fann

<BR>Winnows the buxom Air; till within soare

<BR>Of Towring Eagles, to all the Fowles he seems

<BR>A PHOENIX, gaz'd by all, as that sole Bird

<BR>When to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's

<BR>Bright Temple, to AEGYPTIAN THEB'S he flies.

<BR>At once on th' Eastern cliff of Paradise

<BR>He lights, and to his proper shape returns

<BR>A Seraph wingd; six wings he wore, to shade

<BR>His lineaments Divine; the pair that clad

<BR>Each shoulder broad, came mantling o're his brest

<BR>With regal Ornament; the middle pair

<BR>Girt like a Starrie Zone his waste, and round

<BR>Skirted his loines and thighes with downie Gold

<BR>And colours dipt in Heav'n; the third his feet

<BR>Shaddowd from either heele with featherd maile

<BR>Skie-tinctur'd grain. Like MAIA'S son he stood,

<BR>And shook his Plumes, that Heav'nly fragrance filld

<BR>The circuit wide. Strait knew him all the bands

<BR>Of Angels under watch; and to his state,

<BR>And to his message high in honour rise;

<BR>For on som message high they guessd him bound.

<BR>Thir glittering Tents he passd, and now is come

<BR>Into the blissful field, through Groves of Myrrhe,

<BR>And flouring Odours, Cassia, Nard, and Balme;

<BR>A Wilderness of sweets; for Nature here

<BR>Wantond as in her prime, and plaid at will

<BR>Her Virgin Fancies, pouring forth more sweet,

<BR>Wilde above rule or art; enormous bliss.

<BR>Him through the spicie Forrest onward com

<BR>ADAM discernd, as in the dore he sat

<BR>Of his coole Bowre, while now the mounted Sun

<BR>Shot down direct his fervid Raies, to warme

<BR>Earths inmost womb, more warmth then ADAM need;

<BR>And EVE within, due at her hour prepar'd

<BR>For dinner savourie fruits, of taste to please

<BR>True appetite, and not disrelish thirst

<BR>Of nectarous draughts between, from milkie stream,

<BR>Berrie or Grape: to whom thus ADAM call'd.

<BR>Haste hither EVE, and worth thy sight behold

<BR>Eastward among those Trees, what glorious shape

<BR>Comes this way moving; seems another Morn

<BR>Ris'n on mid-noon; som great behest from Heav'n

<BR>To us perhaps he brings, and will voutsafe

<BR>This day to be our Guest. But goe with speed,

<BR>And what thy stores contain, bring forth and poure

<BR>Abundance, fit to honour and receive

<BR>Our Heav'nly stranger; well we may afford

<BR>Our givers thir own gifts, and large bestow

<BR>From large bestowd, where Nature multiplies

<BR>Her fertil growth, and by disburd'ning grows

<BR>More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare.

<BR>To whom thus EVE. ADAM, earths hallowd mould,

<BR>Of God inspir'd, small store will serve, where store,

<BR>All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk;

<BR>Save what by frugal storing firmness gains

<BR>To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes:

<BR>But I will haste and from each bough and break,

<BR>Each Plant &amp; juciest Gourd will pluck such choice

<BR>To entertain our Angel guest, as hee

<BR>Beholding shall confess that here on Earth

<BR>God hath dispenst his bounties as in Heav'n.

<BR>So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste

<BR>She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent

<BR>What choice to chuse for delicacie best,

<BR>What order, so contriv'd as not to mix

<BR>Tastes, not well joynd, inelegant, but bring

<BR>Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change,

<BR>Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk

<BR>Whatever Earth all-bearing Mother yeilds

<BR>In INDIA East or West, or middle shoare

<BR>In PONTUS or the PUNIC Coast, or where

<BR>ALCINOUS reign'd, fruit of all kindes, in coate,

<BR>Rough, or smooth rin'd, or bearded husk, or shell

<BR>She gathers, Tribute large, and on the board

<BR>Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the Grape

<BR>She crushes, inoffensive moust, and meathes

<BR>From many a berrie, and from sweet kernels prest

<BR>She tempers dulcet creams, nor these to hold

<BR>Wants her fit vessels pure, then strews the ground

<BR>With Rose and Odours from the shrub unfum'd.

<BR>Mean while our Primitive great Sire, to meet

<BR>His god-like Guest, walks forth, without more train

<BR>Accompani'd then with his own compleat

<BR>Perfections, in himself was all his state,

<BR>More solemn then the tedious pomp that waits

<BR>On Princes, when thir rich Retinue long

<BR>Of Horses led, and Grooms besmeard with Gold

<BR>Dazles the croud, and sets them all agape.

<BR>Neerer his presence ADAM though not awd,

<BR>Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek,

<BR>As to a superior Nature, bowing low,

<BR>Thus said. Native of Heav'n, for other place

<BR>None can then Heav'n such glorious shape contain;

<BR>Since by descending from the Thrones above,

<BR>Those happie places thou hast deignd a while

<BR>To want, and honour these, voutsafe with us

<BR>Two onely, who yet by sov'ran gift possess

<BR>This spacious ground, in yonder shadie Bowre

<BR>To rest, and what the Garden choicest bears

<BR>To sit and taste, till this meridian heat

<BR>Be over, and the Sun more coole decline.

<BR>Whom thus the Angelic Vertue answerd milde.

<BR>ADAM, I therefore came, nor art thou such

<BR>Created, or such place hast here to dwell,

<BR>As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heav'n

<BR>To visit thee; lead on then where thy Bowre

<BR>Oreshades; for these mid-hours, till Eevning rise

<BR>I have at will. So to the Silvan Lodge

<BR>They came, that like POMONA'S Arbour smil'd

<BR>With flourets deck't and fragrant smells; but EVE

<BR>Undeckt, save with her self more lovely fair

<BR>Then Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feign'd

<BR>Of three that in Mount IDA naked strove,

<BR>Stood to entertain her guest from Heav'n; no vaile

<BR>Shee needed, Vertue-proof, no thought infirme

<BR>Alterd her cheek. On whom the Angel HAILE

<BR>Bestowd, the holy salutation us'd

<BR>Long after to blest MARIE, second EVE.

<BR>Haile Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful Womb

<BR>Shall fill the World more numerous with thy Sons

<BR>Then with these various fruits the Trees of God

<BR>Have heap'd this Table. Rais'd of grassie terf

<BR>Thir Table was, and mossie seats had round,

<BR>And on her ample Square from side to side

<BR>All AUTUMN pil'd, though SPRING and AUTUMN here

<BR>Danc'd hand in hand. A while discourse they hold;

<BR>No fear lest Dinner coole; when thus began

<BR>Our Authour. Heav'nly stranger, please to taste

<BR>These bounties which our Nourisher, from whom

<BR>All perfet good unmeasur'd out, descends,

<BR>To us for food and for delight hath caus'd

<BR>The Earth to yeild; unsavourie food perhaps

<BR>To spiritual Natures; only this I know,

<BR>That one Celestial Father gives to all.

<BR>To whom the Angel. Therefore what he gives

<BR>(Whose praise be ever sung) to man in part

<BR>Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found

<BR>No ingrateful food: and food alike those pure

<BR>Intelligential substances require

<BR>As doth your Rational; and both contain

<BR>Within them every lower facultie

<BR>Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,

<BR>Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate,

<BR>And corporeal to incorporeal turn.

<BR>For know, whatever was created, needs

<BR>To be sustaind and fed; of Elements

<BR>The grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea,

<BR>Earth and the Sea feed Air, the Air those Fires

<BR>Ethereal, and as lowest first the Moon;

<BR>Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurg'd

<BR>Vapours not yet into her substance turnd.

<BR>Nor doth the Moon no nourishment exhale

<BR>From her moist Continent to higher Orbes.

<BR>The Sun that light imparts to all, receives

<BR>From all his alimental recompence

<BR>In humid exhalations, and at Even

<BR>Sups with the Ocean: though in Heav'n the Trees

<BR>Of life ambrosial frutage bear, and vines

<BR>Yeild Nectar, though from off the boughs each Morn

<BR>We brush mellifluous Dewes, and find the ground

<BR>Cover'd with pearly grain: yet God hath here

<BR>Varied his bounty so with new delights,

<BR>As may compare with Heaven; and to taste

<BR>Think not I shall be nice. So down they sat,

<BR>And to thir viands fell, nor seemingly

<BR>The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss

<BR>Of Theologians, but with keen dispatch

<BR>Of real hunger, and concoctive heate

<BR>To transubstantiate; what redounds, transpires

<BR>Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fire

<BR>Of sooty coal the Empiric Alchimist

<BR>Can turn, or holds it possible to turn

<BR>Metals of drossiest Ore to perfet Gold

<BR>As from the Mine. Mean while at Table EVE

<BR>Ministerd naked, and thir flowing cups

<BR>With pleasant liquors crown'd: O innocence

<BR>Deserving Paradise! if ever, then,

<BR>Then had the Sons of God excuse to have bin

<BR>Enamour'd at that sight; but in those hearts

<BR>Love unlibidinous reign'd, nor jealousie

<BR>Was understood, the injur'd Lovers Hell.

<BR>Thus when with meats &amp; drinks they had suffic'd,

<BR>Not burd'nd Nature, sudden mind arose

<BR>In ADAM, not to let th' occasion pass

<BR>Given him by this great Conference to know

<BR>Of things above his World, and of thir being

<BR>Who dwell in Heav'n, whose excellence he saw

<BR>Transcend his own so farr, whose radiant forms

<BR>Divine effulgence, whose high Power so far

<BR>Exceeded human, and his wary speech

<BR>Thus to th' Empyreal Minister he fram'd.

<BR>Inhabitant with God, now know I well

<BR>Thy favour, in this honour done to man,

<BR>Under whose lowly roof thou hast voutsaf't

<BR>To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste,

<BR>Food not of Angels, yet accepted so,

<BR>As that more willingly thou couldst not seem

<BR>At Heav'ns high feasts to have fed: yet what compare?

<BR>To whom the winged Hierarch repli'd.

<BR>O ADAM, one Almightie is, from whom

<BR>All things proceed, and up to him return,

<BR>If not deprav'd from good, created all

<BR>Such to perfection, one first matter all,

<BR>Indu'd with various forms, various degrees

<BR>Of substance, and in things that live, of life;

<BR>But more refin'd, more spiritous, and pure,

<BR>As neerer to him plac't or neerer tending

<BR>Each in thir several active Sphears assignd,

<BR>Till body up to spirit work, in bounds

<BR>Proportiond to each kind. So from the root

<BR>Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves

<BR>More aerie, last the bright consummate floure

<BR>Spirits odorous breathes: flours and thir fruit

<BR>Mans nourishment, by gradual scale sublim'd

<BR>To vital Spirits aspire, to animal,

<BR>To intellectual, give both life and sense,

<BR>Fansie and understanding, whence the soule

<BR>Reason receives, and reason is her being,

<BR>Discursive, or Intuitive; discourse

<BR>Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours,

<BR>Differing but in degree, of kind the same.

<BR>Wonder not then, what God for you saw good

<BR>If I refuse not, but convert, as you,

<BR>To proper substance; time may come when men

<BR>With Angels may participate, and find

<BR>No inconvenient Diet, nor too light Fare:

<BR>And from these corporal nutriments perhaps

<BR>Your bodies may at last turn all to Spirit

<BR>Improv'd by tract of time, and wingd ascend

<BR>Ethereal, as wee, or may at choice

<BR>Here or in Heav'nly Paradises dwell;

<BR>If ye be found obedient, and retain

<BR>Unalterably firm his love entire

<BR>Whose progenie you are. Mean while enjoy

<BR>Your fill what happiness this happie state

<BR>Can comprehend, incapable of more.

<BR>To whom the Patriarch of mankind repli'd.

<BR>O favourable spirit, propitious guest,

<BR>Well hast thou taught the way that might direct

<BR>Our knowledge, and the scale of Nature set

<BR>From center to circumference, whereon

<BR>In contemplation of created things

<BR>By steps we may ascend to God. But say,

<BR>What meant that caution joind, IF YE BE FOUND

<BR>OBEDIENT? can wee want obedience then

<BR>To him, or possibly his love desert

<BR>Who formd us from the dust, and plac'd us here

<BR>Full to the utmost measure of what bliss

<BR>Human desires can seek or apprehend?

<BR>To whom the Angel. Son of Heav'n and Earth,

<BR>Attend: That thou art happie, owe to God;

<BR>That thou continu'st such, owe to thy self,

<BR>That is, to thy obedience; therein stand.

<BR>This was that caution giv'n thee; be advis'd.

<BR>God made thee perfet, not immutable;

<BR>And good he made thee, but to persevere

<BR>He left it in thy power, ordaind thy will

<BR>By nature free, not over-rul'd by Fate

<BR>Inextricable, or strict necessity;

<BR>Our voluntarie service he requires,

<BR>Not our necessitated, such with him

<BR>Findes no acceptance, nor can find, for how

<BR>Can hearts, not free, be tri'd whether they serve

<BR>Willing or no, who will but what they must

<BR>By Destinie, and can no other choose?

<BR>My self and all th' Angelic Host that stand

<BR>In sight of God enthron'd, our happie state

<BR>Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;

<BR>On other surety none; freely we serve.

<BR>Because wee freely love, as in our will

<BR>To love or not; in this we stand or fall:

<BR>And som are fall'n, to disobedience fall'n,

<BR>And so from Heav'n to deepest Hell; O fall

<BR>From what high state of bliss into what woe!

<BR>To whom our great Progenitor. Thy words

<BR>Attentive, and with more delighted eare

<BR>Divine instructer, I have heard, then when

<BR>Cherubic Songs by night from neighbouring Hills

<BR>Aereal Music send: nor knew I not

<BR>To be both will and deed created free;

<BR>Yet that we never shall forget to love

<BR>Our maker, and obey him whose command

<BR>Single, is yet so just, my constant thoughts

<BR>Assur'd me and still assure: though what thou tellst

<BR>Hath past in Heav'n, som doubt within me move,

<BR>But more desire to hear, if thou consent,

<BR>The full relation, which must needs be strange,

<BR>Worthy of Sacred silence to be heard;

<BR>And we have yet large day, for scarce the Sun

<BR>Hath finisht half his journey, and scarce begins

<BR>His other half in the great Zone of Heav'n.

<BR>Thus ADAM made request, and RAPHAEL

<BR>After short pause assenting, thus began.

<BR>High matter thou injoinst me, O prime of men,

<BR>Sad task and hard, for how shall I relate

<BR>To human sense th' invisible exploits

<BR>Of warring Spirits; how without remorse

<BR>The ruin of so many glorious once

<BR>And perfet while they stood; how last unfould

<BR>The secrets of another world, perhaps

<BR>Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good

<BR>This is dispenc't, and what surmounts the reach

<BR>Of human sense, I shall delineate so,

<BR>By lik'ning spiritual to corporal forms,

<BR>As may express them best, though what if Earth

<BR>Be but the shaddow of Heav'n, and things therein

<BR>Each to other like, more then on earth is thought?

<BR>As yet this world was not, and CHAOS wilde

<BR>Reignd where these Heav'ns now rowl, where Earth now rests

<BR>Upon her Center pois'd, when on a day

<BR>(For Time, though in Eternitie, appli'd

<BR>To motion, measures all things durable

<BR>By present, past, and future) on such day

<BR>As Heav'ns great Year brings forth, th' Empyreal Host

<BR>Of Angels by Imperial summons call'd,

<BR>Innumerable before th' Almighties Throne

<BR>Forthwith from all the ends of Heav'n appeerd

<BR>Under thir Hierarchs in orders bright

<BR>Ten thousand thousand Ensignes high advanc'd,

<BR>Standards, and Gonfalons twixt Van and Reare

<BR>Streame in the Aire, and for distinction serve

<BR>Of Hierarchies, of Orders, and Degrees;

<BR>Or in thir glittering Tissues bear imblaz'd

<BR>Holy Memorials, acts of Zeale and Love

<BR>Recorded eminent. Thus when in Orbes

<BR>Of circuit inexpressible they stood,

<BR>Orb within Orb, the Father infinite,

<BR>By whom in bliss imbosom'd sat the Son,

<BR>Amidst as from a flaming Mount, whoseop

<BR>Brightness had made invisible, thus spake.

<BR>Hear all ye Angels, Progenie of Light,

<BR>Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,

<BR>Hear my Decree, which unrevok't shall stand.

<BR>This day I have begot whom I declare

<BR>My onely Son, and on this holy Hill

<BR>Him have anointed, whom ye now behold

<BR>At my right hand; your Head I him appoint;

<BR>And by my Self have sworn to him shall bow

<BR>All knees in Heav'n, and shall confess him Lord:

<BR>Under his great Vice-gerent Reign abide

<BR>United as one individual Soule

<BR>For ever happie: him who disobeyes

<BR>Mee disobeyes, breaks union, and that day

<BR>Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls

<BR>Into utter darkness, deep ingulft, his place

<BR>Ordaind without redemption, without end.

<BR>So spake th' Omnipotent, and with his words

<BR>All seemd well pleas'd, all seem'd, but were not all.

<BR>That day, as other solem dayes, they spent

<BR>In song and dance about the sacred Hill,

<BR>Mystical dance, which yonder starrie Spheare

<BR>Of Planets and of fixt in all her Wheeles

<BR>Resembles nearest, mazes intricate,

<BR>Eccentric, intervolv'd, yet regular

<BR>Then most, when most irregular they seem:

<BR>And in thir motions harmonie Divine

<BR>So smooths her charming tones, that Gods own ear

<BR>Listens delighted. Eevning approachd

<BR>(For we have also our Eevning and our Morn,

<BR>We ours for change delectable, not need)

<BR>Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn

<BR>Desirous, all in Circles as they stood,

<BR>Tables are set, and on a sudden pil'd

<BR>With Angels Food, and rubied Nectar flows:

<BR>In Pearl, in Diamond, and massie Gold,

<BR>Fruit of delicious Vines, the growth of Heav'n.

<BR>They eat, they drink, and with refection sweet

<BR>Are fill'd, before th' all bounteous King, who showrd

<BR>With copious hand, rejoycing in thir joy.

<BR>Now when ambrosial Night with Clouds exhal'd

<BR>From that high mount of God, whence light &amp; shade

<BR>Spring both, the face of brightest Heav'n had changd

<BR>To grateful Twilight (for Night comes not there

<BR>In darker veile) and roseat Dews dispos'd

<BR>All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest,

<BR>Wide over all the Plain, and wider farr

<BR>Then all this globous Earth in Plain outspred,

<BR>(Such are the Courts of God) Th' Angelic throng

<BR>Disperst in Bands and Files thir Camp extend

<BR>By living Streams among the Trees of Life,

<BR>Pavilions numberless, and sudden reard,

<BR>Celestial Tabernacles, where they slept

<BR>Fannd with coole Winds, save those who in thir course

<BR>Melodious Hymns about the sovran Throne

<BR>Alternate all night long: but not so wak'd

<BR>SATAN, so call him now, his former name

<BR>Is heard no more Heav'n; he of the first,

<BR>If not the first Arch-Angel, great in Power,

<BR>In favour and praeeminence, yet fraught

<BR>With envie against the Son of God, that day

<BR>Honourd by his great Father, and proclaimd

<BR>MESSIAH King anointed, could not beare

<BR>Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaird.

<BR>Deep malice thence conceiving &amp; disdain,

<BR>Soon as midnight brought on the duskie houre

<BR>Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolv'd

<BR>With all his Legions to dislodge, and leave

<BR>Unworshipt, unobey'd the Throne supream

<BR>Contemptuous, and his next subordinate

<BR>Awak'ning, thus to him in secret spake.

<BR>Sleepst thou Companion dear, what sleep can close

<BR>Thy eye-lids? and remembrest what Decree

<BR>Of yesterday, so late hath past the lips

<BR>Of Heav'ns Almightie. Thou to me thy thoughts

<BR>Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart;

<BR>Both waking we were one; how then can now

<BR>Thy sleep dissent? new Laws thou seest impos'd;

<BR>New Laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise

<BR>In us who serve, new Counsels, to debate

<BR>What doubtful may ensue, more in this place

<BR>To utter is not safe. Assemble thou

<BR>Of all those Myriads which we lead the chief;

<BR>Tell them that by command, ere yet dim Night

<BR>Her shadowie Cloud withdraws, I am to haste,

<BR>And all who under me thir Banners wave,

<BR>Homeward with flying march where we possess

<BR>The Quarters of the North, there to prepare

<BR>Fit entertainment to receive our King

<BR>The great MESSIAH, and his new commands,

<BR>Who speedily through all the Hierarchies

<BR>Intends to pass triumphant, and give Laws.

<BR>So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infus'd

<BR>Bad influence into th' unwarie brest

<BR>Of his Associate; hee together calls,

<BR>Or several one by one, the Regent Powers,

<BR>Under him Regent, tells, as he was taught,

<BR>That the most High commanding, now ere Night,

<BR>Now ere dim Night had disincumberd Heav'n,

<BR>The great Hierarchal Standard was to move;

<BR>Tells the suggested cause, and casts between

<BR>Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound

<BR>Or taint integritie; but all obey'd

<BR>The wonted signal, and superior voice

<BR>Of thir great Potentate; for great indeed

<BR>His name, and high was his degree in Heav'n;

<BR>His count'nance, as the Morning Starr that guides

<BR>The starrie flock, allur'd them, and with lyes

<BR>Drew after him the third part of Heav'ns Host:

<BR>Mean while th' Eternal eye, whose sight discernes

<BR>Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy Mount

<BR>And from within the golden Lamps that burne

<BR>Nightly before him, saw without thir light

<BR>Rebellion rising, saw in whom, how spred

<BR>Among the sons of Morn, what multitudes

<BR>Were banded to oppose his high Decree;

<BR>And smiling to his onely Son thus said.

<BR>Son, thou in whom my glory I behold

<BR>In full resplendence, Heir of all my might,

<BR>Neerly it now concernes us to be sure

<BR>Of our Omnipotence, and with what Arms

<BR>We mean to hold what anciently we claim

<BR>Of Deitie or Empire, such a foe

<BR>Is rising, who intends to erect his Throne

<BR>Equal to ours, throughout the spacious North;

<BR>Nor so content, hath in his thought to trie

<BR>In battel, what our Power is, or our right.

<BR>Let us advise, and to this hazard draw

<BR>With speed what force is left, and all imploy

<BR>In our defence, lest unawares we lose

<BR>This our high place, our Sanctuarie, our Hill.

<BR>To whom the Son with calm aspect and cleer

<BR>Light'ning Divine, ineffable, serene,

<BR>Made answer. Mightie Father, thou thy foes

<BR>Justly hast in derision, and secure

<BR>Laugh'st at thir vain designes and tumults vain,

<BR>Matter to mee of Glory, whom thir hate

<BR>Illustrates, when they see all Regal Power

<BR>Giv'n me to quell thir pride, and in event

<BR>Know whether I be dextrous to subdue

<BR>Thy Rebels, or be found the worst in Heav'n.

<BR>So spake the Son, but SATAN with his Powers

<BR>Farr was advanc't on winged speed, an Host

<BR>Innumerable as the Starrs of Night,

<BR>Or Starrs of Morning, Dew-drops, which the Sun

<BR>Impearls on every leaf and every flouer.

<BR>Regions they pass'd, the mightie Regencies

<BR>Of Seraphim and Potentates and Thrones

<BR>In thir triple Degrees, Regions to which

<BR>All thy Dominion, ADAM, is no more

<BR>Then what this Garden is to all the Earth,

<BR>And all the Sea, from one entire globose

<BR>Stretcht into Longitude; which having pass'd

<BR>At length into the limits of the North

<BR>They came, and SATAN to his Royal seat

<BR>High on a Hill, far blazing, as a Mount

<BR>Rais'd on a Mount, with Pyramids and Towrs

<BR>From Diamond Quarries hew'n, &amp; Rocks of Gold,

<BR>The Palace of great LUCIFER, (so call

<BR>That Structure in the Dialect of men

<BR>Interpreted) which not long after, hee

<BR>Affecting all equality with God,

<BR>In imitation of that Mount whereon

<BR>MESSIAH was declar'd in sight of Heav'n,

<BR>The Mountain of the Congregation call'd;

<BR>For thither he assembl'd all his Train,

<BR>Pretending so commanded to consult

<BR>About the great reception of thir King,

<BR>Thither to come, and with calumnious Art

<BR>Of counterfeted truth thus held thir ears.

<BR>Thrones, Dominations, Princedomes, Vertues, Powers,

<BR>If these magnific Titles yet remain

<BR>Not meerly titular, since by Decree

<BR>Another now hath to himself ingross't

<BR>All Power, and us eclipst under the name

<BR>Of King anointed, for whom all this haste

<BR>Of midnight march, and hurried meeting here,

<BR>This onely to consult how we may best

<BR>With what may be devis'd of honours new

<BR>Receive him coming to receive from us

<BR>Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile,

<BR>Too much to one, but double how endur'd,

<BR>To one and to his image now proclaim'd?

<BR>But what if better counsels might erect

<BR>Our minds and teach us to cast off this Yoke?

<BR>Will ye submit your necks, and chuse to bend

<BR>The supple knee? ye will not, if I trust

<BR>To know ye right, or if ye know your selves

<BR>Natives and Sons of Heav'n possest before

<BR>By none, and if not equal all, yet free,

<BR>Equally free; for Orders and Degrees

<BR>Jarr not with liberty, but well consist.

<BR>Who can in reason then or right assume

<BR>Monarchie over such as live by right

<BR>His equals, if in power and splendor less,

<BR>In freedome equal? or can introduce

<BR>Law and Edict on us, who without law

<BR>Erre not, much less for this to be our Lord,

<BR>And look for adoration to th' abuse

<BR>Of those Imperial Titles which assert

<BR>Our being ordain'd to govern, not to serve?

<BR>Thus farr his bold discourse without controule

<BR>Had audience, when among the Seraphim

<BR>ABDIEL, then whom none with more zeale ador'd

<BR>The Deitie, and divine commands obei'd,

<BR>Stood up, and in a flame of zeale severe

<BR>The current of his fury thus oppos'd.

<BR>O argument blasphemous, false and proud!

<BR>Words which no eare ever to hear in Heav'n

<BR>Expected, least of all from thee, ingrate

<BR>In place thy self so high above thy Peeres.

<BR>Canst thou with impious obloquie condemne

<BR>The just Decree of God, pronounc't and sworn,

<BR>That to his only Son by right endu'd

<BR>With Regal Scepter, every Soule in Heav'n

<BR>Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due

<BR>Confess him rightful King? unjust thou saist

<BR>Flatly unjust, to binde with Laws the free,

<BR>And equal over equals to let Reigne,

<BR>One over all with unsucceeded power.

<BR>Shalt thou give Law to God, shalt thou dispute

<BR>With him the points of libertie, who made

<BR>Thee what thou art, &amp; formd the Pow'rs of Heav'n

<BR>Such as he pleasd, and circumscrib'd thir being?

<BR>Yet by experience taught we know how good,

<BR>And of our good, and of our dignitie

<BR>How provident he is, how farr from thought

<BR>To make us less, bent rather to exalt

<BR>Our happie state under one Head more neer

<BR>United. But to grant it thee unjust,

<BR>That equal over equals Monarch Reigne:

<BR>Thy self though great &amp; glorious dost thou count,

<BR>Or all Angelic Nature joind in one,

<BR>Equal to him begotten Son, by whom

<BR>As by his Word the mighty Father made

<BR>All things, ev'n thee, and all the Spirits of Heav'n

<BR>By him created in thir bright degrees,

<BR>Crownd them with Glory, &amp; to thir Glory nam'd

<BR>Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers

<BR>Essential Powers, nor by his Reign obscur'd,

<BR>But more illustrious made, since he the Head

<BR>One of our number thus reduc't becomes,

<BR>His Laws our Laws, all honour to him done

<BR>Returns our own. Cease then this impious rage,

<BR>And tempt not these; but hast'n to appease

<BR>Th' incensed Father, and th' incensed Son,

<BR>While Pardon may be found in time besought.

<BR>So spake the fervent Angel, but his zeale

<BR>None seconded, as out of season judg'd,

<BR>Or singular and rash, whereat rejoic'd

<BR>Th' Apostat, and more haughty thus repli'd.

<BR>That we were formd then saist thou? &amp; the work

<BR>Of secondarie hands, by task transferd

<BR>From Father to his Son? strange point and new!

<BR>Doctrin which we would know whence learnt: who saw

<BR>When this creation was? rememberst thou

<BR>Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being?

<BR>We know no time when we were not as now;

<BR>Know none before us, self-begot, self-rais'd

<BR>By our own quick'ning power, when fatal course

<BR>Had circl'd his full Orbe, the birth mature

<BR>Of this our native Heav'n, Ethereal Sons.

<BR>Our puissance is our own, our own right hand

<BR>Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try

<BR>Who is our equal: then thou shalt behold

<BR>Whether by supplication we intend

<BR>Address, and to begirt th' Almighty Throne

<BR>Beseeching or besieging. This report,

<BR>These tidings carrie to th' anointed King;

<BR>And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.

<BR>He said, and as the sound of waters deep

<BR>Hoarce murmur echo'd to his words applause

<BR>Through the infinite Host, nor less for that

<BR>The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone

<BR>Encompass'd round with foes, thus answerd bold.

<BR>O alienate from God, O spirit accurst,

<BR>Forsak'n of all good; I see thy fall

<BR>Determind, and thy hapless crew involv'd

<BR>In this perfidious fraud, contagion spred

<BR>Both of thy crime and punishment: henceforth

<BR>No more be troubl'd how to quit the yoke

<BR>Of Gods MESSIAH; those indulgent Laws

<BR>Will not be now voutsaf't, other Decrees

<BR>Against thee are gon forth without recall;

<BR>That Golden Scepter which thou didst reject

<BR>Is now an Iron Rod to bruise and breake

<BR>Thy disobedience. Well thou didst advise,

<BR>Yet not for thy advise or threats I fly

<BR>These wicked Tents devoted, least the wrauth

<BR>Impendent, raging into sudden flame

<BR>Distinguish not: for soon expect to feel

<BR>His Thunder on thy head, devouring fire.

<BR>Then who created thee lamenting learne,

<BR>When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.

<BR>So spake the Seraph ABDIEL faithful found,

<BR>Among the faithless, faithful only hee;

<BR>Among innumerable false, unmov'd,

<BR>Unshak'n, unseduc'd, unterrifi'd

<BR>His Loyaltie he kept, his Love, his Zeale;

<BR>Nor number, nor example with him wrought

<BR>To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind

<BR>Though single. From amidst them forth he passd,

<BR>Long way through hostile scorn, which he susteind

<BR>Superior, nor of violence fear'd aught;

<BR>And with retorted scorn his back he turn'd

<BR>On those proud Towrs to swift destruction doom'd.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Meanwhile the hainous and despightfull act

<BR>Of SATAN done in Paradise, and how

<BR>Hee in the Serpent had perverted EVE,

<BR>Her Husband shee, to taste the fatall fruit,

<BR>Was known in Heav'n; for what can scape the Eye

<BR>Of God All-seeing, or deceave his Heart

<BR>Omniscient, who in all things wise and just,

<BR>Hinder'd not SATAN to attempt the minde

<BR>Of Man, with strength entire, and free Will arm'd,

<BR>Complete to have discover'd and repulst

<BR>Whatever wiles of Foe or seeming Friend.

<BR>For still they knew, and ought to have still remember'd

<BR>The high Injunction not to taste that Fruit,

<BR>Whoever tempted; which they not obeying,

<BR>Incurr'd, what could they less, the penaltie,

<BR>And manifold in sin, deserv'd to fall.

<BR>Up into Heav'n from Paradise in hast

<BR>Th' Angelic Guards ascended, mute and sad

<BR>For Man, for of his state by this they knew,

<BR>Much wondring how the suttle Fiend had stoln

<BR>Entrance unseen. Soon as th' unwelcome news

<BR>From Earth arriv'd at Heaven Gate, displeas'd

<BR>All were who heard, dim sadness did not spare

<BR>That time Celestial visages, yet mixt

<BR>With pitie, violated not thir bliss.

<BR>About the new-arriv'd, in multitudes

<BR>Th' ethereal People ran, to hear and know

<BR>How all befell: they towards the Throne Supream

<BR>Accountable made haste to make appear

<BR>With righteous plea, thir utmost vigilance,

<BR>And easily approv'd; when the most High

<BR>Eternal Father from his secret Cloud,

<BR>Amidst in Thunder utter'd thus his voice.

<BR>Assembl'd Angels, and ye Powers return'd

<BR>From unsuccessful charge, be not dismaid,

<BR>Nor troubl'd at these tidings from the Earth,

<BR>Which your sincerest care could not prevent,

<BR>Foretold so lately what would come to pass,

<BR>When first this Tempter cross'd the Gulf from Hell.

<BR>I told ye then he should prevail and speed

<BR>On his bad Errand, Man should be seduc't

<BR>And flatter'd out of all, believing lies

<BR>Against his Maker; no Decree of mine

<BR>Concurring to necessitate his Fall,

<BR>Or touch with lightest moment of impulse

<BR>His free Will, to her own inclining left

<BR>In eevn scale. But fall'n he is, and now

<BR>What rests, but that the mortal Sentence pass

<BR>On his transgression, Death denounc't that day,

<BR>Which he presumes already vain and void,

<BR>Because not yet inflicted, as he fear'd,

<BR>By some immediate stroak; but soon shall find

<BR>Forbearance no acquittance ere day end.

<BR>Justice shall not return as bountie scorn'd.

<BR>But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee

<BR>Vicegerent Son, to thee I have transferr'd

<BR>All Judgement, whether in Heav'n, or Earth; or Hell.

<BR>Easie it may be seen that I intend

<BR>Mercie collegue with Justice, sending thee

<BR>Mans Friend, his Mediator, his design'd

<BR>Both Ransom and Redeemer voluntarie,

<BR>And destin'd Man himself to judge Man fall'n.

<BR>So spake the Father, and unfoulding bright

<BR>Toward the right hand his Glorie, on the Son

<BR>Blaz'd forth unclouded Deitie; he full

<BR>Resplendent all his Father manifest

<BR>Express'd, and thus divinely answer'd milde.

<BR>Father Eternal, thine is to decree,

<BR>Mine both in Heav'n and Earth to do thy will

<BR>Supream, that thou in mee thy Son belov'd

<BR>Mayst ever rest well pleas'd. I go to judge

<BR>On Earth these thy transgressors, but thou knowst,

<BR>Whoever judg'd, the worst on mee must light,

<BR>When time shall be, for so I undertook

<BR>Before thee; and not repenting, this obtaine

<BR>Of right, that I may mitigate thir doom

<BR>On me deriv'd, yet I shall temper so

<BR>Justice with Mercie, as may illustrate most

<BR>Them fully satisfied, and thee appease.

<BR>Attendance none shall need, nor Train, where none

<BR>Are to behold the Judgement, but the judg'd,

<BR>Those two; the third best absent is condemn'd,

<BR>Convict by flight, and Rebel to all Law

<BR>Conviction to the Serpent none belongs.

<BR>Thus saying, from his radiant Seat he rose

<BR>Of high collateral glorie: him Thrones and Powers,

<BR>Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant

<BR>Accompanied to Heaven Gate, from whence

<BR>EDEN and all the Coast in prospect lay.

<BR>Down he descended strait; the speed of Gods

<BR>Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes wing'd.

<BR>Now was the Sun in Western cadence low

<BR>From Noon, and gentle Aires due at thir hour

<BR>To fan the Earth now wak'd, and usher in

<BR>The Eevning coole when he from wrauth more coole

<BR>Came the mild Judge and Intercessor both

<BR>To sentence Man: the voice of God they heard

<BR>Now walking in the Garden, by soft windes

<BR>Brought to thir Ears, while day declin'd, they heard

<BR>And from his presence hid themselves among

<BR>The thickest Trees, both Man and Wife, till God

<BR>Approaching, thus to ADAM call'd aloud.

<BR>Where art thou ADAM, wont with joy to meet

<BR>My coming seen far off? I miss thee here,

<BR>Not pleas'd, thus entertaind with solitude,

<BR>Where obvious dutie erewhile appear'd unsaught:

<BR>Or come I less conspicuous, or what change

<BR>Absents thee, or what chance detains? Come forth.

<BR>He came, and with him EVE, more loth, though first

<BR>To offend, discount'nanc't both, and discompos'd;

<BR>Love was not in thir looks, either to God

<BR>Or to each other, but apparent guilt,

<BR>And shame, and perturbation, and despaire,

<BR>Anger, and obstinacie, and hate, and guile.

<BR>Whence ADAM faultring long, thus answer'd brief.

<BR>I heard thee in the Garden, and of thy voice

<BR>Affraid, being naked, hid my self. To whom

<BR>The gracious Judge without revile repli'd.

<BR>My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not fear'd,

<BR>But still rejoyc't, how is it now become

<BR>So dreadful to thee? that thou art naked, who

<BR>Hath told thee? hast thou eaten of the Tree

<BR>Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat?

<BR>To whom thus ADAM sore beset repli'd.

<BR>O Heav'n! in evil strait this day I stand

<BR>Before my Judge, either to undergoe

<BR>My self the total Crime, or to accuse

<BR>My other self, the partner of my life;

<BR>Whose failing, while her Faith to me remaines,

<BR>I should conceal, and not expose to blame

<BR>By my complaint; but strict necessitie

<BR>Subdues me, and calamitous constraint,

<BR>Least on my head both sin and punishment,

<BR>However insupportable, be all

<BR>Devolv'd; though should I hold my peace, yet thou

<BR>Wouldst easily detect what I conceale.

<BR>This Woman whom thou mad'st to be my help,

<BR>And gav'st me as thy perfet gift, so good,

<BR>So fit, so acceptable, so Divine,

<BR>That from her hand I could suspect no ill,

<BR>And what she did, whatever in it self,

<BR>Her doing seem'd to justifie the deed;

<BR>Shee gave me of the Tree, and I did eate.

<BR>To whom the sovran Presence thus repli'd.

<BR>Was shee thy God, that her thou didst obey

<BR>Before his voice, or was shee made thy guide,

<BR>Superior, or but equal, that to her

<BR>Thou did'st resigne thy Manhood, and the Place

<BR>Wherein God set thee above her made of thee,

<BR>And for thee, whose perfection farr excell'd

<BR>Hers in all real dignitie: Adornd

<BR>She was indeed, and lovely to attract

<BR>Thy Love, not thy Subjection, and her Gifts

<BR>Were such as under Government well seem'd,

<BR>Unseemly to beare rule, which was thy part

<BR>And person, had'st thou known thy self aright.

<BR>So having said, he thus to EVE in few:

<BR>Say Woman, what is this which thou hast done?

<BR>To whom sad EVE with shame nigh overwhelm'd,

<BR>Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge

<BR>Bold or loquacious, thus abasht repli'd.

<BR>The Serpent me beguil'd and I did eate.

<BR>Which when the Lord God heard, without delay

<BR>To Judgement he proceeded on th' accus'd

<BR>Serpent though brute, unable to transferre

<BR>The Guilt on him who made him instrument

<BR>Of mischief, and polluted from the end

<BR>Of his Creation; justly then accurst,

<BR>As vitiated in Nature: more to know

<BR>Concern'd not Man (since he no further knew)

<BR>Nor alter'd his offence; yet God at last

<BR>To Satan first in sin his doom apply'd,

<BR>Though in mysterious terms, judg'd as then best:

<BR>And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall.

<BR>Because thou hast done this, thou art accurst

<BR>Above all Cattel, each Beast of the Field;

<BR>Upon thy Belly groveling thou shalt goe,

<BR>And dust shalt eat all the days of thy Life.

<BR>Between Thee and the Woman I will put

<BR>Enmitie, and between thine and her Seed;

<BR>Her Seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel.

<BR>So spake this Oracle, then verifi'd

<BR>When JESUS son of MARY second EVE,

<BR>Saw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heav'n,

<BR>Prince of the Aire; then rising from his Grave

<BR>Spoild Principalities and Powers, triumpht

<BR>In open shew, and with ascention bright

<BR>Captivity led captive through the Aire,

<BR>The Realme it self of Satan long usurpt,

<BR>Whom he shall tread at last under our feet;

<BR>Eevn hee who now foretold his fatal bruise,

<BR>And to the Woman thus his Sentence turn'd.

<BR>Thy sorrow I will greatly multiplie

<BR>By thy Conception; Children thou shalt bring

<BR>In sorrow forth, and to thy Husbands will

<BR>Thine shall submit, hee over thee shall rule.

<BR>On ADAM last thus judgement he pronounc'd.

<BR>Because thou hast heark'nd to the voice of thy Wife,

<BR>And eaten of the Tree concerning which

<BR>I charg'd thee, saying: Thou shalt not eate thereof,

<BR>Curs'd is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow

<BR>Shalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life;

<BR>Thornes also and Thistles it shall bring thee forth

<BR>Unbid, and thou shalt eate th' Herb of th' Field,

<BR>In the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eate Bread,

<BR>Till thou return unto the ground, for thou

<BR>Out of the ground wast taken, know thy Birth,

<BR>For dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne.

<BR>So judg'd he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent,

<BR>And th' instant stroke of Death denounc't that day

<BR>Remov'd farr off; then pittying how they stood

<BR>Before him naked to the aire, that now

<BR>Must suffer change, disdain'd not to begin

<BR>Thenceforth the forme of servant to assume,

<BR>As when he wash'd his servants feet, so now

<BR>As Father of his Familie he clad

<BR>Thir nakedness with Skins of Beasts, or slain,

<BR>Or as the Snake with youthful Coate repaid;

<BR>And thought not much to cloath his Enemies:

<BR>Nor hee thir outward onely with the Skins

<BR>Of Beasts, but inward nakedness, much more

<BR>Opprobrious, with his Robe of righteousness,

<BR>Araying cover'd from his Fathers sight.

<BR>To him with swift ascent he up returnd,

<BR>Into his blissful bosom reassum'd

<BR>In glory as of old, to him appeas'd

<BR>All, though all-knowing, what had past with Man

<BR>Recounted, mixing intercession sweet.

<BR>Meanwhile ere thus was sin'd and judg'd on Earth,

<BR>Within the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death,

<BR>In counterview within the Gates, that now

<BR>Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame

<BR>Farr into CHAOS, since the Fiend pass'd through,

<BR>Sin opening, who thus now to Death began.

<BR>O Son, why sit we here each other viewing

<BR>Idlely, while Satan our great Author thrives

<BR>In other Worlds, and happier Seat provides

<BR>For us his ofspring deare? It cannot be

<BR>But that success attends him; if mishap,

<BR>Ere this he had return'd, with fury driv'n

<BR>By his Avenger, since no place like this

<BR>Can fit his punishment, or their revenge.

<BR>Methinks I feel new strength within me rise,

<BR>Wings growing, and Dominion giv'n me large

<BR>Beyond this Deep; whatever drawes me on,

<BR>Or sympathie, or som connatural force

<BR>Powerful at greatest distance to unite

<BR>With secret amity things of like kinde

<BR>By secretest conveyance. Thou my Shade

<BR>Inseparable must with mee along:

<BR>For Death from Sin no power can separate.

<BR>But least the difficultie of passing back

<BR>Stay his returne perhaps over this Gulfe

<BR>Impassable, impervious, let us try

<BR>Adventrous work, yet to thy power and mine

<BR>Not unagreeable, to found a path

<BR>Over this Maine from Hell to that new World

<BR>Where Satan now prevailes, a Monument

<BR>Of merit high to all th' infernal Host,

<BR>Easing thir passage hence, for intercourse,

<BR>Or transmigration, as thir lot shall lead.

<BR>Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn

<BR>By this new felt attraction and instinct.

<BR>Whom thus the meager Shadow answerd soon.

<BR>Goe whither Fate and inclination strong

<BR>Leads thee, I shall not lag behinde, nor erre

<BR>The way, thou leading, such a sent I draw

<BR>Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste

<BR>The savour of Death from all things there that live:

<BR>Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest

<BR>Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid.

<BR>So saying, with delight he snuff'd the smell

<BR>Of mortal change on Earth. As when a flock

<BR>Of ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote,

<BR>Against the day of Battel, to a Field,

<BR>Where Armies lie encampt, come flying, lur'd

<BR>With sent of living Carcasses design'd

<BR>For death, the following day, in bloodie fight.

<BR>So sented the grim Feature, and upturn'd

<BR>His Nostril wide into the murkie Air,

<BR>Sagacious of his Quarrey from so farr.

<BR>Then Both from out Hell Gates into the waste

<BR>Wide Anarchie of CHAOS damp and dark

<BR>Flew divers, &amp; with Power (thir Power was great)

<BR>Hovering upon the Waters; what they met

<BR>Solid or slimie, as in raging Sea

<BR>Tost up and down, together crowded drove

<BR>From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell.

<BR>As when two Polar Winds blowing adverse

<BR>Upon the CRONIAN Sea, together drive

<BR>Mountains of Ice, that stop th' imagin'd way

<BR>Beyond PETSORA Eastward, to the rich

<BR>CATHAIAN Coast. The aggregated Soyle

<BR>Death with his Mace petrific, cold and dry,

<BR>As with a Trident smote, and fix't as firm

<BR>As DELOS floating once; the rest his look

<BR>Bound with GORGONIAN rigor not to move,

<BR>And with ASPHALTIC slime; broad as the Gate,

<BR>Deep to the Roots of Hell the gather'd beach

<BR>They fasten'd, and the Mole immense wraught on

<BR>Over the foaming deep high Archt, a Bridge

<BR>Of length prodigious joyning to the Wall

<BR>Immoveable of this now fenceless world

<BR>Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad,

<BR>Smooth, easie, inoffensive down to Hell.

<BR>So, if great things to small may be compar'd,

<BR>XERXES, the Libertie of GREECE to yoke,

<BR>From SUSA his MEMNONIAN Palace high

<BR>Came to the Sea, and over HELLESPONT

<BR>Bridging his way, EUROPE with ASIA joyn'd,

<BR>And scourg'd with many a stroak th' indignant waves.

<BR>Now had they brought the work by wondrous Art

<BR>Pontifical, a ridge of pendent Rock

<BR>Over the vext Abyss, following the track

<BR>Of SATAN, to the selfsame place where hee

<BR>First lighted from his Wing, and landed safe

<BR>From out of CHAOS to the outside bare

<BR>Of this round World: with Pinns of Adamant

<BR>And Chains they made all fast, too fast they made

<BR>And durable; and now in little space

<BR>The Confines met of Empyrean Heav'n

<BR>And of this World, and on the left hand Hell

<BR>With long reach interpos'd; three sev'ral wayes

<BR>In sight, to each of these three places led.

<BR>And now thir way to Earth they had descri'd,

<BR>To Paradise first tending, when behold

<BR>SATAN in likeness of an Angel bright

<BR>Betwixt the CENTAURE and the SCORPION stearing

<BR>His ZENITH, while the Sun in ARIES rose:

<BR>Disguis'd he came, but those his Children dear

<BR>Thir Parent soon discern'd, though in disguise.

<BR>Hee, after EVE seduc't, unminded slunk

<BR>Into the Wood fast by, and changing shape

<BR>To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act

<BR>By EVE, though all unweeting, seconded

<BR>Upon her Husband, saw thir shame that sought

<BR>Vain covertures; but when he saw descend

<BR>The Son of God to judge them, terrifi'd

<BR>Hee fled, not hoping to escape, but shun

<BR>The present, fearing guiltie what his wrauth

<BR>Might suddenly inflict; that past, return'd

<BR>By Night, and listning where the hapless Paire

<BR>Sate in thir sad discourse, and various plaint,

<BR>Thence gatherd his own doom, which understood

<BR>Not instant, but of future time. With joy

<BR>And tidings fraught, to Hell he now return'd,

<BR>And at the brink of CHAOS, neer the foot

<BR>Of this new wondrous Pontifice, unhop't

<BR>Met who to meet him came, his Ofspring dear.

<BR>Great joy was at thir meeting, and at sight

<BR>Of that stupendious Bridge his joy encreas'd.

<BR>Long hee admiring stood, till Sin, his faire

<BR>Inchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke.

<BR>O Parent, these are thy magnific deeds,

<BR>Thy Trophies, which thou view'st as not thine own,

<BR>Thou art thir Author and prime Architect:

<BR>For I no sooner in my Heart divin'd,

<BR>My Heart, which by a secret harmonie

<BR>Still moves with thine, joyn'd in connexion sweet,

<BR>That thou on Earth hadst prosper'd, which thy looks

<BR>Now also evidence, but straight I felt

<BR>Though distant from thee Worlds between, yet felt

<BR>That I must after thee with this thy Son;

<BR>Such fatal consequence unites us three:

<BR>Hell could no longer hold us in her bounds,

<BR>Nor this unvoyageable Gulf obscure

<BR>Detain from following thy illustrious track.

<BR>Thou hast atchiev'd our libertie, confin'd

<BR>Within Hell Gates till now, thou us impow'rd

<BR>To fortifie thus farr, and overlay

<BR>With this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss.

<BR>Thine now is all this World, thy vertue hath won

<BR>What thy hands builded not, thy Wisdom gain'd

<BR>With odds what Warr hath lost, and fully aveng'd

<BR>Our foile in Heav'n; here thou shalt Monarch reign,

<BR>There didst not; there let him still Victor sway,

<BR>As Battel hath adjudg'd, from this new World

<BR>Retiring, by his own doom alienated,

<BR>And henceforth Monarchie with thee divide

<BR>Of all things, parted by th' Empyreal bounds,

<BR>His Quadrature, from thy Orbicular World,

<BR>Or trie thee now more dang'rous to his Throne.

<BR>Whom thus the Prince of Darkness answerd glad.

<BR>Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both,

<BR>High proof ye now have giv'n to be the Race

<BR>Of SATAN (for I glorie in the name,

<BR>Antagonist of Heav'ns Almightie King)

<BR>Amply have merited of me, of all

<BR>Th' Infernal Empire, that so neer Heav'ns dore

<BR>Triumphal with triumphal act have met,

<BR>Mine with this glorious Work, &amp; made one Realm

<BR>Hell and this World, one Realm, one Continent

<BR>Of easie thorough-fare. Therefore while I

<BR>Descend through Darkness, on your Rode with ease

<BR>To my associate Powers, them to acquaint

<BR>With these successes, and with them rejoyce,

<BR>You two this way, among those numerous Orbs

<BR>All yours, right down to Paradise descend;

<BR>There dwell &amp; Reign in bliss, thence on the Earth

<BR>Dominion exercise and in the Aire,

<BR>Chiefly on Man, sole Lord of all declar'd,

<BR>Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill.

<BR>My Substitutes I send ye, and Create

<BR>Plenipotent on Earth, of matchless might

<BR>Issuing from mee: on your joynt vigor now

<BR>My hold of this new Kingdom all depends,

<BR>Through Sin to Death expos'd by my exploit.

<BR>If your joynt power prevaile, th' affaires of Hell

<BR>No detriment need feare, goe and be strong.

<BR>So saying he dismiss'd them, they with speed

<BR>Thir course through thickest Constellations held

<BR>Spreading thir bane; the blasted Starrs lookt wan,

<BR>And Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclips

<BR>Then sufferd. Th' other way SATAN went down

<BR>The Causey to Hell Gate; on either side

<BR>Disparted CHAOS over built exclaimd,

<BR>And with rebounding surge the barrs assaild,

<BR>That scorn'd his indignation: through the Gate,

<BR>Wide open and unguarded, SATAN pass'd,

<BR>And all about found desolate; for those

<BR>Appointed to sit there, had left thir charge,

<BR>Flown to the upper World; the rest were all

<BR>Farr to the inland retir'd, about the walls

<BR>Of PANDEMONIUM, Citie and proud seate

<BR>Of LUCIFER, so by allusion calld,

<BR>Of that bright Starr to SATAN paragond.

<BR>There kept thir Watch the Legions, while the Grand

<BR>In Council sate, sollicitous what chance

<BR>Might intercept thir Emperour sent, so hee

<BR>Departing gave command, and they observ'd.

<BR>As when the TARTAR from his RUSSIAN Foe

<BR>By ASTRACAN over the Snowie Plaines

<BR>Retires, or BACTRIAN Sophi from the hornes

<BR>Of TURKISH Crescent, leaves all waste beyond

<BR>The Realme of ALADULE, in his retreate

<BR>To TAURIS or CASBEEN. So these the late

<BR>Heav'n-banisht Host, left desert utmost Hell

<BR>Many a dark League, reduc't in careful Watch

<BR>Round thir Metropolis, and now expecting

<BR>Each hour their great adventurer from the search

<BR>Of Forrein Worlds: he through the midst unmarkt,

<BR>In shew plebeian Angel militant

<BR>Of lowest order, past; and from the dore

<BR>Of that PLUTONIAN Hall, invisible

<BR>Ascended his high Throne, which under state

<BR>Of richest texture spred, at th' upper end

<BR>Was plac't in regal lustre. Down a while

<BR>He sate, and round about him saw unseen:

<BR>At last as from a Cloud his fulgent head

<BR>And shape Starr bright appeer'd, or brighter, clad

<BR>With what permissive glory since his fall

<BR>Was left him, or false glitter: All amaz'd

<BR>At that so sudden blaze the STYGIAN throng

<BR>Bent thir aspect, and whom they wish'd beheld,

<BR>Thir mighty Chief returnd: loud was th' acclaime:

<BR>Forth rush'd in haste the great consulting Peers,

<BR>Rais'd from thir dark DIVAN, and with like joy

<BR>Congratulant approach'd him, who with hand

<BR>Silence, and with these words attention won.

<BR>Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,

<BR>For in possession such, not onely of right,

<BR>I call ye and declare ye now, returnd

<BR>Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth

<BR>Triumphant out of this infernal Pit

<BR>Abominable, accurst, the house of woe,

<BR>And Dungeon of our Tyrant: Now possess,

<BR>As Lords, a spacious World, to our native Heaven

<BR>Little inferiour, by my adventure hard

<BR>With peril great atchiev'd. Long were to tell

<BR>What I have don, what sufferd, with what paine

<BR>Voyag'd the unreal, vast, unbounded deep

<BR>Of horrible confusion, over which

<BR>By Sin and Death a broad way now is pav'd

<BR>To expedite your glorious march; but I

<BR>Toild out my uncouth passage, forc't to ride

<BR>Th' untractable Abysse, plung'd in the womb

<BR>Of unoriginal NIGHT and CHAOS wilde,

<BR>That jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos'd

<BR>My journey strange, with clamorous uproare

<BR>Protesting Fate supreame; thence how I found

<BR>The new created World, which fame in Heav'n

<BR>Long had foretold, a Fabrick wonderful

<BR>Of absolute perfection, therein Man

<BR>Plac't in a Paradise, by our exile

<BR>Made happie: Him by fraud I have seduc'd

<BR>From his Creator, and the more to increase

<BR>Your wonder, with an Apple; he thereat

<BR>Offended, worth your laughter, hath giv'n up

<BR>Both his beloved Man and all his World,

<BR>To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us,

<BR>Without our hazard, labour or allarme,

<BR>To range in, and to dwell, and over Man

<BR>To rule, as over all he should have rul'd.

<BR>True is, mee also he hath judg'd, or rather

<BR>Mee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape

<BR>Man I deceav'd: that which to mee belongs,

<BR>Is enmity, which he will put between

<BR>Mee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel;

<BR>His Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head:

<BR>A World who would not purchase with a bruise,

<BR>Or much more grievous pain? Ye have th' account

<BR>Of my performance: What remaines, ye Gods,

<BR>But up and enter now into full bliss.

<BR>So having said, a while he stood, expecting

<BR>Thir universal shout and high applause

<BR>To fill his eare, when contrary he hears

<BR>On all sides, from innumerable tongues

<BR>A dismal universal hiss, the sound

<BR>Of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long

<BR>Had leasure, wondring at himself now more;

<BR>His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare,

<BR>His Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining

<BR>Each other, till supplanted down he fell

<BR>A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone,

<BR>Reluctant, but in vaine, a greater power

<BR>Now rul'd him, punisht in the shape he sin'd,

<BR>According to his doom: he would have spoke,

<BR>But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue

<BR>To forked tongue, for now were all transform'd

<BR>Alike, to Serpents all as accessories

<BR>To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din

<BR>Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now

<BR>With complicated monsters, head and taile,

<BR>Scorpion and Asp, and AMPHISBAENA dire,

<BR>CERASTES hornd, HYDRUS, and ELLOPS drear,

<BR>And DIPSAS (Not so thick swarm'd once the Soil

<BR>Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle

<BR>OPHIUSA) but still greatest hee the midst,

<BR>Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun

<BR>Ingenderd in the PYTHIAN Vale on slime,

<BR>Huge PYTHON, and his Power no less he seem'd

<BR>Above the rest still to retain; they all

<BR>Him follow'd issuing forth to th' open Field,

<BR>Where all yet left of that revolted Rout

<BR>Heav'n-fall'n, in station stood or just array,

<BR>Sublime with expectation when to see

<BR>In Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief;

<BR>They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd

<BR>Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell,

<BR>And horrid sympathie; for what they saw,

<BR>They felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms,

<BR>Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast,

<BR>And the dire hiss renew'd, and the dire form

<BR>Catcht by Contagion, like in punishment,

<BR>As in thir crime. Thus was th' applause they meant,

<BR>Turnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame

<BR>Cast on themselves from thir own mouths. There stood

<BR>A Grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change,

<BR>His will who reigns above, to aggravate

<BR>Thir penance, laden with fair Fruit, like that

<BR>VVhich grew in Paradise, the bait of EVE

<BR>Us'd by the Tempter: on that prospect strange

<BR>Thir earnest eyes they fix'd, imagining

<BR>For one forbidden Tree a multitude

<BR>Now ris'n, to work them furder woe or shame;

<BR>Yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce,

<BR>Though to delude them sent, could not abstain,

<BR>But on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees

<BR>Climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks

<BR>That curld MEGAERA: greedily they pluck'd

<BR>The Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew

<BR>Neer that bituminous Lake where SODOM flam'd;

<BR>This more delusive, not the touch, but taste

<BR>Deceav'd; they fondly thinking to allay

<BR>Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit

<BR>Chewd bitter Ashes, which th' offended taste

<BR>VVith spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd,

<BR>Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft,

<BR>VVith hatefullest disrelish writh'd thir jaws

<BR>VVith foot and cinders fill'd; so oft they fell

<BR>Into the same illusion, not as Man

<BR>Whom they triumph'd once lapst. Thus were they plagu'd

<BR>And worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss,

<BR>Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum'd,

<BR>Yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo

<BR>This annual humbling certain number'd days,

<BR>To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc't.

<BR>However some tradition they dispers'd

<BR>Among the Heathen of thir purchase got,

<BR>And Fabl'd how the Serpent, whom they calld

<BR>OPHION with EURYNOME, the wide-

<BR>Encroaching EVE perhaps, had first the rule

<BR>Of high OLYMPUS, thence by SATURN driv'n

<BR>And OPS, ere yet DICTAEAN JOVE was born.

<BR>Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair

<BR>Too soon arriv'd, SIN there in power before,

<BR>Once actual, now in body, and to dwell

<BR>Habitual habitant; behind her DEATH

<BR>Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet

<BR>On his pale Horse: to whom SIN thus began.

<BR>Second of SATAN sprung, all conquering Death,

<BR>What thinkst thou of our Empire now, though earnd

<BR>With travail difficult, not better farr

<BR>Then stil at Hels dark threshold to have sate watch,

<BR>Unnam'd, undreaded, and thy self half starv'd?

<BR>Whom thus the Sin-born Monster answerd soon.

<BR>To mee, who with eternal Famin pine,

<BR>Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven,

<BR>There best, where most with ravin I may meet;

<BR>Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems

<BR>To stuff this Maw, this vast unhide-bound Corps.

<BR>To whom th' incestuous Mother thus repli'd.

<BR>Thou therefore on these Herbs, and Fruits, &amp; Flours

<BR>Feed first, on each Beast next, and Fish, and Fowle,

<BR>No homely morsels, and whatever thing

<BR>The Sithe of Time mowes down, devour unspar'd,

<BR>Till I in Man residing through the Race,

<BR>His thoughts, his looks, words, actions all infect,

<BR>And season him thy last and sweetest prey.

<BR>This said, they both betook them several wayes,

<BR>Both to destroy, or unimmortal make

<BR>All kinds, and for destruction to mature

<BR>Sooner or later; which th' Almightie seeing,

<BR>From his transcendent Seat the Saints among,

<BR>To those bright Orders utterd thus his voice.

<BR>See with what heat these Dogs of Hell advance

<BR>To waste and havoc yonder VVorld, which I

<BR>So fair and good created, and had still

<BR>Kept in that state, had not the folly of Man

<BR>Let in these wastful Furies, who impute

<BR>Folly to mee, so doth the Prince of Hell

<BR>And his Adherents, that with so much ease

<BR>I suffer them to enter and possess

<BR>A place so heav'nly, and conniving seem

<BR>To gratifie my scornful Enemies,

<BR>That laugh, as if transported with some fit

<BR>Of Passion, I to them had quitted all,

<BR>At random yeilded up to their misrule;

<BR>And know not that I call'd and drew them thither

<BR>My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth

<BR>Which mans polluting Sin with taint hath shed

<BR>On what was pure, till cramm'd and gorg'd, nigh burst

<BR>With suckt and glutted offal, at one fling

<BR>Of thy victorious Arm, well-pleasing Son,

<BR>Both SIN, and DEATH, and yawning GRAVE at last

<BR>Through CHAOS hurld, obstruct the mouth of Hell

<BR>For ever, and seal up his ravenous Jawes.

<BR>Then Heav'n and Earth renewd shall be made pure

<BR>To sanctitie that shall receive no staine:

<BR>Till then the Curse pronounc't on both precedes.

<BR>Hee ended, and the heav'nly Audience loud

<BR>Sung HALLELUIA, as the sound of Seas,

<BR>Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways,

<BR>Righteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works;

<BR>Who can extenuate thee? Next, to the Son,

<BR>Destin'd restorer of Mankind, by whom

<BR>New Heav'n and Earth shall to the Ages rise,

<BR>Or down from Heav'n descend. Such was thir song,

<BR>While the Creator calling forth by name

<BR>His mightie Angels gave them several charge,

<BR>As sorted best with present things. The Sun

<BR>Had first his precept so to move, so shine,

<BR>As might affect the Earth with cold and heat

<BR>Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call

<BR>Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring

<BR>Solstitial summers heat. To the blanc Moone

<BR>Her office they prescrib'd, to th' other five

<BR>Thir planetarie motions and aspects

<BR>In SEXTILE, SQUARE, and TRINE, and OPPOSITE,

<BR>Of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne

<BR>In Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt

<BR>Thir influence malignant when to showre,

<BR>Which of them rising with the Sun, or falling,

<BR>Should prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set

<BR>Thir corners, when with bluster to confound

<BR>Sea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle

<BR>With terror through the dark Aereal Hall.

<BR>Some say he bid his Angels turne ascanse

<BR>The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more

<BR>From the Suns Axle; they with labour push'd

<BR>Oblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun

<BR>Was bid turn Reines from th' Equinoctial Rode

<BR>Like distant breadth to TAURUS with the Seav'n

<BR>ATLANTICK Sisters, and the SPARTAN Twins

<BR>Up to the TROPIC Crab; thence down amaine

<BR>By LEO and the VIRGIN and the SCALES,

<BR>As deep as CAPRICORNE, to bring in change

<BR>Of Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring

<BR>Perpetual smil'd on Earth with vernant Flours,

<BR>Equal in Days and Nights, except to those

<BR>Beyond the Polar Circles; to them Day

<BR>Had unbenighted shon, while the low Sun

<BR>To recompence his distance, in thir sight

<BR>Had rounded still th' HORIZON, and not known

<BR>Or East or West, which had forbid the Snow

<BR>From cold ESTOTILAND, and South as farr

<BR>Beneath MAGELLAN. At that tasted Fruit

<BR>The Sun, as from THYESTEAN Banquet, turn'd

<BR>His course intended; else how had the World

<BR>Inhabited, though sinless, more then now,

<BR>Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate?

<BR>These changes in the Heav'ns, though slow, produc'd

<BR>Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast,

<BR>Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot,

<BR>Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North

<BR>Of NORUMBEGA, and the SAMOED shoar

<BR>Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice

<BR>And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw,

<BR>BOREAS and CAECIAS and ARGESTES loud

<BR>And THRASCIAS rend the Woods and Seas upturn;

<BR>With adverse blast up-turns them from the South

<BR>NOTUS and AFER black with thundrous Clouds

<BR>From SERRALIONA; thwart of these as fierce

<BR>Forth rush the LEVANT and the PONENT VVindes

<BR>EURUS and ZEPHIR with thir lateral noise,

<BR>SIROCCO, and LIBECCHIO. Thus began

<BR>Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first

<BR>Daughter of Sin, among th' irrational,

<BR>Death introduc'd through fierce antipathie:

<BR>Beast now with Beast gan war, &amp; Fowle with Fowle,

<BR>And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving,

<BR>Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe

<BR>Of Man, but fled him, or with count'nance grim

<BR>Glar'd on him passing: these were from without

<BR>The growing miseries, which ADAM saw

<BR>Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade,

<BR>To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within,

<BR>And in a troubl'd Sea of passion tost,

<BR>Thus to disburd'n sought with sad complaint.

<BR>O miserable of happie! is this the end

<BR>Of this new glorious World, and mee so late

<BR>The Glory of that Glory, who now becom

<BR>Accurst of blessed, hide me from the face

<BR>Of God, whom to behold was then my highth

<BR>Of happiness: yet well, if here would end

<BR>The miserie, I deserv'd it, and would beare

<BR>My own deservings; but this will not serve;

<BR>All that I eate or drink, or shall beget,

<BR>Is propagated curse. O voice once heard

<BR>Delightfully, ENCREASE AND MULTIPLY,

<BR>Now death to heare! for what can I encrease

<BR>Or multiplie, but curses on my head?

<BR>Who of all Ages to succeed, but feeling

<BR>The evil on him brought by me, will curse

<BR>My Head, Ill fare our Ancestor impure,

<BR>For this we may thank ADAM; but his thanks

<BR>Shall be the execration; so besides

<BR>Mine own that bide upon me, all from mee

<BR>Shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound,

<BR>On mee as on thir natural center light

<BR>Heavie, though in thir place. O fleeting joyes

<BR>Of Paradise, deare bought with lasting woes!

<BR>Did I request thee, Maker, from my Clay

<BR>To mould me Man, did I sollicite thee

<BR>From darkness to promote me, or here place

<BR>In this delicious Garden? as my Will

<BR>Concurd not to my being, it were but right

<BR>And equal to reduce me to my dust,

<BR>Desirous to resigne, and render back

<BR>All I receav'd, unable to performe

<BR>Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold

<BR>The good I sought not. To the loss of that,

<BR>Sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added

<BR>The sense of endless woes? inexplicable

<BR>Thy Justice seems; yet to say truth, too late,

<BR>I thus contest; then should have been refusd

<BR>Those terms whatever, when they were propos'd:

<BR>Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good,

<BR>Then cavil the conditions? and though God

<BR>Made thee without thy leave, what if thy Son

<BR>Prove disobedient, and reprov'd, retort,

<BR>Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not:

<BR>Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee

<BR>That proud excuse? yet him not thy election,

<BR>But Natural necessity begot.

<BR>God made thee of choice his own, and of his own

<BR>To serve him, thy reward was of his grace,

<BR>Thy punishment then justly is at his Will.

<BR>Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair,

<BR>That dust I am, and shall to dust returne:

<BR>O welcom hour whenever! why delayes

<BR>His hand to execute what his Decree

<BR>Fixd on this day? why do I overlive,

<BR>Why am I mockt with death, and length'nd out

<BR>To deathless pain? how gladly would I meet

<BR>Mortalitie my sentence, and be Earth

<BR>Insensible, how glad would lay me down

<BR>As in my Mothers lap? there I should rest

<BR>And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more

<BR>Would Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse

<BR>To mee and to my ofspring would torment me

<BR>With cruel expectation. Yet one doubt

<BR>Pursues me still, least all I cannot die,

<BR>Least that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of Man

<BR>Which God inspir'd, cannot together perish

<BR>With this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave,

<BR>Or in some other dismal place, who knows

<BR>But I shall die a living Death? O thought

<BR>Horrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath

<BR>Of Life that sinn'd; what dies but what had life

<BR>And sin? the Bodie properly hath neither.

<BR>All of me then shall die: let this appease

<BR>The doubt, since humane reach no further knows.

<BR>For though the Lord of all be infinite,

<BR>Is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so,

<BR>But mortal doom'd. How can he exercise

<BR>Wrath without end on Man whom Death must end?

<BR>Can he make deathless Death? that were to make

<BR>Strange contradiction, which to God himself

<BR>Impossible is held, as Argument

<BR>Of weakness, not of Power. Will he, draw out,

<BR>For angers sake, finite to infinite

<BR>In punisht man, to satisfie his rigour

<BR>Satisfi'd never; that were to extend

<BR>His Sentence beyond dust and Natures Law,

<BR>By which all Causes else according still

<BR>To the reception of thir matter act,

<BR>Not to th' extent of thir own Spheare. But say

<BR>That Death be not one stroak, as I suppos'd,

<BR>Bereaving sense, but endless miserie

<BR>From this day onward, which I feel begun

<BR>Both in me, and without me, and so last

<BR>To perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear

<BR>Comes thundring back with dreadful revolution

<BR>On my defensless head; both Death and I

<BR>Am found Eternal, and incorporate both,

<BR>Nor I on my part single, in mee all

<BR>Posteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie

<BR>That I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able

<BR>To waste it all my self, and leave ye none!

<BR>So disinherited how would ye bless

<BR>Me now your Curse! Ah, why should all mankind

<BR>For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn'd,

<BR>If guiltless? But from mee what can proceed,

<BR>But all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav'd,

<BR>Not to do onely, but to will the same

<BR>With me? how can they acquitted stand

<BR>In sight of God? Him after all Disputes

<BR>Forc't I absolve: all my evasions vain

<BR>And reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still

<BR>But to my own conviction: first and last

<BR>On mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring

<BR>Of all corruption, all the blame lights due;

<BR>So might the wrauth, Fond wish! couldst thou support

<BR>That burden heavier then the Earth to bear,

<BR>Then all the world much heavier, though divided

<BR>With that bad Woman? Thus what thou desir'st,

<BR>And what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope

<BR>Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable

<BR>Beyond all past example and future,

<BR>To SATAN onely like both crime and doom.

<BR>O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears

<BR>And horrors hast thou driv'n me; out of which

<BR>I find no way, from deep to deeper plung'd!

<BR>Thus ADAM to himself lamented loud

<BR>Through the still Night, now now, as ere man fell,

<BR>Wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air

<BR>Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom,

<BR>Which to his evil Conscience represented

<BR>All things with double terror: On the ground

<BR>Outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft

<BR>Curs'd his Creation, Death as oft accus'd

<BR>Of tardie execution, since denounc't

<BR>The day of his offence. Why comes not Death,

<BR>Said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke

<BR>To end me? Shall Truth fail to keep her word,

<BR>Justice Divine not hast'n to be just?

<BR>But Death comes not at call, Justice Divine

<BR>Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries.

<BR>O Woods, O Fountains, Hillocks, Dales and Bowrs,

<BR>VVith other echo farr I taught your Shades

<BR>To answer, and resound farr other Song.

<BR>VVhom thus afflicted when sad EVE beheld,

<BR>Desolate where she sate, approaching nigh,

<BR>Soft words to his fierce passion she assay'd:

<BR>But her with stern regard he thus repell'd.

<BR>Out of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best

<BR>Befits thee with him leagu'd, thy self as false

<BR>And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape,

<BR>Like his, and colour Serpentine may shew

<BR>Thy inward fraud, to warn all Creatures from thee

<BR>Henceforth; least that too heav'nly form, pretended

<BR>To hellish falshood, snare them. But for thee

<BR>I had persisted happie, had not thy pride

<BR>And wandring vanitie, when lest was safe,

<BR>Rejected my forewarning, and disdain'd

<BR>Not to be trusted, longing to be seen

<BR>Though by the Devil himself, him overweening

<BR>To over-reach, but with the Serpent meeting

<BR>Fool'd and beguil'd, by him thou, I by thee,

<BR>To trust thee from my side, imagin'd wise,

<BR>Constant, mature, proof against all assaults,

<BR>And understood not all was but a shew

<BR>Rather then solid vertu, all but a Rib

<BR>Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears,

<BR>More to the part sinister from me drawn,

<BR>Well if thrown out, as supernumerarie

<BR>To my just number found. O why did God,

<BR>Creator wise, that peopl'd highest Heav'n

<BR>With Spirits Masculine, create at last

<BR>This noveltie on Earth, this fair defect

<BR>Of Nature, and not fill the World at once

<BR>With Men as Angels without Feminine,

<BR>Or find some other way to generate

<BR>Mankind? this mischief had not then befall'n,

<BR>And more that shall befall, innumerable

<BR>Disturbances on Earth through Femal snares,

<BR>And straight conjunction with this Sex: for either

<BR>He never shall find out fit Mate, but such

<BR>As some misfortune brings him, or mistake,

<BR>Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain

<BR>Through her perverseness, but shall see her gaind

<BR>By a farr worse, or if she love, withheld

<BR>By Parents, or his happiest choice too late

<BR>Shall meet, alreadie linkt and Wedlock-bound

<BR>To a fell Adversarie, his hate or shame:

<BR>Which infinite calamitie shall cause

<BR>To humane life, and houshold peace confound.

<BR>He added not, and from her turn'd, but EVE

<BR>Not so repulst, with Tears that ceas'd not flowing,

<BR>And tresses all disorderd, at his feet

<BR>Fell humble, and imbracing them, besaught

<BR>His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint.

<BR>Forsake me not thus, ADAM, witness Heav'n

<BR>What love sincere, and reverence in my heart

<BR>I beare thee, and unweeting have offended,

<BR>Unhappilie deceav'd; thy suppliant

<BR>I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not,

<BR>Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid,

<BR>Thy counsel in this uttermost distress,

<BR>My onely strength and stay: forlorn of thee,

<BR>Whither shall I betake me, where subsist?

<BR>While yet we live, scarse one short hour perhaps,

<BR>Between us two let there be peace, both joyning,

<BR>As joyn'd in injuries, one enmitie

<BR>Against a Foe by doom express assign'd us,

<BR>That cruel Serpent: On me exercise not

<BR>Thy hatred for this miserie befall'n,

<BR>On me already lost, mee then thy self

<BR>More miserable; both have sin'd, but thou

<BR>Against God onely, I against God and thee,

<BR>And to the place of judgement will return,

<BR>There with my cries importune Heaven, that all

<BR>The sentence from thy head remov'd may light

<BR>On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe,

<BR>Mee mee onely just object of his ire.

<BR>She ended weeping, and her lowlie plight,

<BR>Immoveable till peace obtain'd from fault

<BR>Acknowledg'd and deplor'd, in ADAM wraught

<BR>Commiseration; soon his heart relented

<BR>Towards her, his life so late and sole delight,

<BR>Now at his feet submissive in distress,

<BR>Creature so faire his reconcilement seeking,

<BR>His counsel whom she had displeas'd, his aide;

<BR>As one disarm'd, his anger all he lost,

<BR>And thus with peaceful words uprais'd her soon.

<BR>Unwarie, and too desirous, as before,

<BR>So now of what thou knowst not, who desir'st

<BR>The punishment all on thy self; alas,

<BR>Beare thine own first, ill able to sustaine

<BR>His full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part,

<BR>And my displeasure bearst so ill. If Prayers

<BR>Could alter high Decrees, I to that place

<BR>Would speed before thee, and be louder heard,

<BR>That on my head all might be visited,

<BR>Thy frailtie and infirmer Sex forgiv'n,

<BR>To me committed and by me expos'd.

<BR>But rise, let us no more contend, nor blame

<BR>Each other, blam'd enough elsewhere, but strive

<BR>In offices of Love, how we may light'n

<BR>Each others burden in our share of woe;

<BR>Since this days Death denounc't, if ought I see,

<BR>Will prove no sudden, but a slow-pac't evill,

<BR>A long days dying to augment our paine,

<BR>And to our Seed (O hapless Seed!) deriv'd.

<BR>To whom thus EVE, recovering heart, repli'd.

<BR>ADAM, by sad experiment I know

<BR>How little weight my words with thee can finde,

<BR>Found so erroneous, thence by just event

<BR>Found so unfortunate; nevertheless,

<BR>Restor'd by thee, vile as I am, to place

<BR>Of new acceptance, hopeful to regaine

<BR>Thy Love, the sole contentment of my heart,

<BR>Living or dying from thee I will not hide

<BR>What thoughts in my unquiet brest are ris'n,

<BR>Tending to som relief of our extremes,

<BR>Or end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable,

<BR>As in our evils, and of easier choice.

<BR>If care of our descent perplex us most,

<BR>Which must be born to certain woe, devourd

<BR>By Death at last, and miserable it is

<BR>To be to others cause of misery,

<BR>Our own begotten, and of our Loines to bring

<BR>Into this cursed World a woful Race,

<BR>That after wretched Life must be at last

<BR>Food for so foule a Monster, in thy power

<BR>It lies, yet ere Conception to prevent

<BR>The Race unblest, to being yet unbegot.

<BR>Childless thou art, Childless remaine:

<BR>So Death shall be deceav'd his glut, and with us two

<BR>Be forc'd to satisfie his Rav'nous Maw.

<BR>But if thou judge it hard and difficult,

<BR>Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain

<BR>From Loves due Rites, Nuptial embraces sweet,

<BR>And with desire to languish without hope,

<BR>Before the present object languishing

<BR>With like desire, which would be miserie

<BR>And torment less then none of what we dread,

<BR>Then both our selves and Seed at once to free

<BR>From what we fear for both, let us make short,

<BR>Let us seek Death, or hee not found, supply

<BR>With our own hands his Office on our selves;

<BR>Why stand we longer shivering under feares,

<BR>That shew no end but Death, and have the power,

<BR>Of many wayes to die the shortest choosing,

<BR>Destruction with destruction to destroy.

<BR>She ended heer, or vehement despaire

<BR>Broke off the rest; so much of Death her thoughts

<BR>Had entertaind, as di'd her Cheeks with pale.

<BR>But ADAM with such counsel nothing sway'd,

<BR>To better hopes his more attentive minde

<BR>Labouring had rais'd, and thus to EVE repli'd.

<BR>EVE, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems

<BR>To argue in thee somthing more sublime

<BR>And excellent then what thy minde contemnes;

<BR>But self-destruction therefore saught, refutes

<BR>That excellence thought in thee, and implies,

<BR>Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret

<BR>For loss of life and pleasure overlov'd.

<BR>Or if thou covet death, as utmost end

<BR>Of miserie, so thinking to evade

<BR>The penaltie pronounc't, doubt not but God

<BR>Hath wiselier arm'd his vengeful ire then so

<BR>To be forestall'd; much more I fear least Death

<BR>So snatcht will not exempt us from the paine

<BR>We are by doom to pay; rather such acts

<BR>Of contumacie will provoke the highest

<BR>To make death in us live: Then let us seek

<BR>Som safer resolution, which methinks

<BR>I have in view, calling to minde with heed

<BR>Part of our Sentence, that thy Seed shall bruise

<BR>The Serpents head; piteous amends, unless

<BR>Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand Foe

<BR>SATAN, who in the Serpent hath contriv'd

<BR>Against us this deceit: to crush his head

<BR>Would be revenge indeed; which will be lost

<BR>By death brought on our selves, or childless days

<BR>Resolv'd, as thou proposest; so our Foe

<BR>Shall scape his punishment ordain'd, and wee

<BR>Instead shall double ours upon our heads.

<BR>No more be mention'd then of violence

<BR>Against our selves, and wilful barrenness,

<BR>That cuts us off from hope, and savours onely

<BR>Rancor and pride, impatience and despite,

<BR>Reluctance against God and his just yoke

<BR>Laid on our Necks. Remember with what mild

<BR>And gracious temper he both heard and judg'd

<BR>Without wrauth or reviling; wee expected

<BR>Immediate dissolution, which we thought

<BR>Was meant by Death that day, when lo, to thee

<BR>Pains onely in Child-bearing were foretold,

<BR>And bringing forth, soon recompenc't with joy,

<BR>Fruit of thy Womb: On mee the Curse aslope

<BR>Glanc'd on the ground, with labour I must earne

<BR>My bread; what harm? Idleness had bin worse;

<BR>My labour will sustain me; and least Cold

<BR>Or Heat should injure us, his timely care

<BR>Hath unbesaught provided, and his hands

<BR>Cloath'd us unworthie, pitying while he judg'd;

<BR>How much more, if we pray him, will his ear

<BR>Be open, and his heart to pitie incline,

<BR>And teach us further by what means to shun

<BR>Th' inclement Seasons, Rain, Ice, Hail and Snow,

<BR>Which now the Skie with various Face begins

<BR>To shew us in this Mountain, while the Winds

<BR>Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks

<BR>Of these fair spreading Trees; which bids us seek

<BR>Som better shroud, som better warmth to cherish

<BR>Our Limbs benumm'd, ere this diurnal Starr

<BR>Leave cold the Night, how we his gather'd beams

<BR>Reflected, may with matter sere foment,

<BR>Or by collision of two bodies grinde

<BR>The Air attrite to Fire, as late the Clouds

<BR>Justling or pusht with Winds rude in thir shock

<BR>Tine the slant Lightning, whose thwart flame driv'n down

<BR>Kindles the gummie bark of Firr or Pine,

<BR>And sends a comfortable heat from farr,

<BR>Which might supplie the Sun: such Fire to use,

<BR>And what may else be remedie or cure

<BR>To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought,

<BR>Hee will instruct us praying, and of Grace

<BR>Beseeching him, so as we need not fear

<BR>To pass commodiously this life, sustain'd

<BR>By him with many comforts, till we end

<BR>In dust, our final rest and native home.

<BR>What better can we do, then to the place

<BR>Repairing where he judg'd us, prostrate fall

<BR>Before him reverent, and there confess

<BR>Humbly our faults, and pardon beg, with tears

<BR>VVatering the ground, and with our sighs the Air

<BR>Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign

<BR>Of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek.

<BR>Undoubtedly he will relent and turn

<BR>From his displeasure; in whose look serene,

<BR>VVhen angry most he seem'd and most severe,

<BR>VVhat else but favor, grace, and mercie shon?

<BR>So spake our Father penitent, nor EVE

<BR>Felt less remorse: they forthwith to the place

<BR>Repairing where he judg'd them prostrate fell

<BR>Before him reverent, and both confess'd

<BR>Humbly thir faults, and pardon beg'd, with tears

<BR>VVatering the ground, and with thir sighs the Air

<BR>Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign

<BR>Of sorrow unfeign'd, and humiliation meek.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>His proud imaginations thus displaid.

<BR>Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heav'n,

<BR>For since no deep within her gulf can hold

<BR>Immortal vigor, though opprest and fall'n,

<BR>I give not Heav'n for lost. From this descent

<BR>Celestial vertues rising, will appear

<BR>More glorious and more dread then from no fall,

<BR>And trust themselves to fear no second fate:

<BR>Mee though just right, and the fixt Laws of Heav'n

<BR>Did first create your Leader, next, free choice,

<BR>With what besides, in Counsel or in Fight,

<BR>Hath bin achievd of merit, yet this loss

<BR>Thus farr at least recover'd, hath much more

<BR>Establisht in a safe unenvied Throne

<BR>Yeilded with full consent. The happier state

<BR>In Heav'n, which follows dignity, might draw

<BR>Envy from each inferior; but who here

<BR>Will envy whom the highest place exposes

<BR>Formost to stand against the Thunderers aime

<BR>Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share

<BR>Of endless pain? where there is then no good

<BR>For which to strive, no strife can grow up there

<BR>From Faction; for none sure will claim in hell

<BR>Precedence, none, whose portion is so small

<BR>Of present pain, that with ambitious mind

<BR>Will covet more. With this advantage then

<BR>To union, and firm Faith, and firm accord,

<BR>More then can be in Heav'n, we now return

<BR>To claim our just inheritance of old,

<BR>Surer to prosper then prosperity

<BR>Could have assur'd us; and by what best way,

<BR>Whether of open Warr or covert guile,

<BR>We now debate; who can advise, may speak.

<BR>He ceas'd, and next him MOLOC, Scepter'd King

<BR>Stood up, the strongest and the fiercest Spirit

<BR>That fought in Heav'n; now fiercer by despair:

<BR>His trust was with th' Eternal to be deem'd

<BR>Equal in strength, and rather then be less

<BR>Car'd not to be at all; with that care lost

<BR>Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse

<BR>He reckd not, and these words thereafter spake.

<BR>My sentence is for open Warr: Of Wiles,

<BR>More unexpert, I boast not: them let those

<BR>Contrive who need, or when they need, not now.

<BR>For while they sit contriving, shall the rest,

<BR>Millions that stand in Arms, and longing wait

<BR>The Signal to ascend, sit lingring here

<BR>Heav'ns fugitives, and for thir dwelling place

<BR>Accept this dark opprobrious Den of shame,

<BR>The Prison of his Tyranny who Reigns

<BR>By our delay? no, let us rather choose

<BR>Arm'd with Hell flames and fury all at once

<BR>O're Heav'ns high Towrs to force resistless way,

<BR>Turning our Tortures into horrid Arms

<BR>Against the Torturer; when to meet the noise

<BR>Of his Almighty Engin he shall hear

<BR>Infernal Thunder, and for Lightning see

<BR>Black fire and horror shot with equal rage

<BR>Among his Angels; and his Throne it self

<BR>Mixt with TARTAREAN Sulphur, and strange fire,

<BR>His own invented Torments. But perhaps

<BR>The way seems difficult and steep to scale

<BR>With upright wing against a higher foe.

<BR>Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench

<BR>Of that forgetful Lake benumme not still,

<BR>That in our proper motion we ascend

<BR>Up to our native seat: descent and fall

<BR>To us is adverse. Who but felt of late

<BR>When the fierce Foe hung on our brok'n Rear

<BR>Insulting, and pursu'd us through the Deep,

<BR>With what compulsion and laborious flight

<BR>We sunk thus low? Th' ascent is easie then;

<BR>Th' event is fear'd; should we again provoke

<BR>Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find

<BR>To our destruction: if there be in Hell

<BR>Fear to be worse destroy'd: what can be worse

<BR>Then to dwell here, driv'n out from bliss, condemn'd

<BR>In this abhorred deep to utter woe;

<BR>Where pain of unextinguishable fire

<BR>Must exercise us without hope of end

<BR>The Vassals of his anger, when the Scourge

<BR>Inexorably, and the torturing houre

<BR>Calls us to Penance? More destroy'd then thus

<BR>We should be quite abolisht and expire.

<BR>What fear we then? what doubt we to incense

<BR>His utmost ire? which to the highth enrag'd,

<BR>Will either quite consume us, and reduce

<BR>To nothing this essential, happier farr

<BR>Then miserable to have eternal being:

<BR>Or if our substance be indeed Divine,

<BR>And cannot cease to be, we are at worst

<BR>On this side nothing; and by proof we feel

<BR>Our power sufficient to disturb his Heav'n,

<BR>And with perpetual inrodes to Allarme,

<BR>Though inaccessible, his fatal Throne:

<BR>Which if not Victory is yet Revenge.

<BR>He ended frowning, and his look denounc'd

<BR>Desperate revenge, and Battel dangerous

<BR>To less then Gods. On th' other side up rose

<BR>BELIAL, in act more graceful and humane;

<BR>A fairer person lost not Heav'n; he seemd

<BR>For dignity compos'd and high exploit:

<BR>But all was false and hollow; though his Tongue

<BR>Dropt Manna, and could make the worse appear

<BR>The better reason, to perplex and dash

<BR>Maturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low;

<BR>To vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds

<BR>Timorous and slothful: yet he pleas'd the eare,

<BR>And with perswasive accent thus began.

<BR>I should be much for open Warr, O Peers,

<BR>As not behind in hate; if what was urg'd

<BR>Main reason to perswade immediate Warr,

<BR>Did not disswade me most, and seem to cast

<BR>Ominous conjecture on the whole success:

<BR>When he who most excels in fact of Arms,

<BR>In what he counsels and in what excels

<BR>Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair

<BR>And utter dissolution, as the scope

<BR>Of all his aim, after some dire revenge.

<BR>First, what Revenge? the Towrs of Heav'n are fill'd

<BR>With Armed watch, that render all access

<BR>Impregnable; oft on the bordering Deep

<BR>Encamp thir Legions, or with obscure wing

<BR>Scout farr and wide into the Realm of night,

<BR>Scorning surprize. Or could we break our way

<BR>By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise

<BR>With blackest Insurrection, to confound

<BR>Heav'ns purest Light, yet our great Enemie

<BR>All incorruptible would on his Throne

<BR>Sit unpolluted, and th' Ethereal mould

<BR>Incapable of stain would soon expel

<BR>Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire

<BR>Victorious. Thus repuls'd, our final hope

<BR>Is flat despair: we must exasperate

<BR>Th' Almighty Victor to spend all his rage,

<BR>And that must end us, that must be our cure,

<BR>To be no more; sad cure; for who would loose,

<BR>Though full of pain, this intellectual being,

<BR>Those thoughts that wander through Eternity,

<BR>To perish rather, swallowd up and lost

<BR>In the wide womb of uncreated night,

<BR>Devoid of sense and motion? and who knows,

<BR>Let this be good, whether our angry Foe

<BR>Can give it, or will ever? how he can

<BR>Is doubtful; that he never will is sure.

<BR>Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire,

<BR>Belike through impotence, or unaware,

<BR>To give his Enemies thir wish, and end

<BR>Them in his anger, whom his anger saves

<BR>To punish endless? wherefore cease we then?

<BR>Say they who counsel Warr, we are decreed,

<BR>Reserv'd and destin'd to Eternal woe;

<BR>Whatever doing, what can we suffer more,

<BR>What can we suffer worse? is this then worst,

<BR>Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms?

<BR>What when we fled amain, pursu'd and strook

<BR>With Heav'ns afflicting Thunder, and besought

<BR>The Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem'd

<BR>A refuge from those wounds: or when we lay

<BR>Chain'd on the burning Lake? that sure was worse.

<BR>What if the breath that kindl'd those grim fires

<BR>Awak'd should blow them into sevenfold rage

<BR>And plunge us in the Flames? or from above

<BR>Should intermitted vengeance Arme again

<BR>His red right hand to plague us? what if all

<BR>Her stores were op'n'd, and this Firmament

<BR>Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire,

<BR>Impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall

<BR>One day upon our heads; while we perhaps

<BR>Designing or exhorting glorious Warr,

<BR>Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl'd

<BR>Each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey

<BR>Of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk

<BR>Under yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains;

<BR>There to converse with everlasting groans,

<BR>Unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd,

<BR>Ages of hopeless end; this would be worse.

<BR>Warr therefore, open or conceal'd, alike

<BR>My voice disswades; for what can force or guile

<BR>With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye

<BR>Views all things at one view? he from heav'ns highth

<BR>All these our motions vain, sees and derides;

<BR>Not more Almighty to resist our might

<BR>Then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.

<BR>Shall we then live thus vile, the race of Heav'n

<BR>Thus trampl'd, thus expell'd to suffer here

<BR>Chains &amp; these Torments? better these then worse

<BR>By my advice; since fate inevitable

<BR>Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree,

<BR>The Victors will. To suffer, as to doe,

<BR>Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust

<BR>That so ordains: this was at first resolv'd,

<BR>If we were wise, against so great a foe

<BR>Contending, and so doubtful what might fall.

<BR>I laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold

<BR>And vent'rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear

<BR>What yet they know must follow, to endure

<BR>Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain,

<BR>The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now

<BR>Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear,

<BR>Our Supream Foe in time may much remit

<BR>His anger, and perhaps thus farr remov'd

<BR>Not mind us not offending, satisfi'd

<BR>With what is punish't; whence these raging fires

<BR>Will slack'n, if his breath stir not thir flames.

<BR>Our purer essence then will overcome

<BR>Thir noxious vapour, or enur'd not feel,

<BR>Or chang'd at length, and to the place conformd

<BR>In temper and in nature, will receive

<BR>Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain;

<BR>This horror will grow milde, this darkness light,

<BR>Besides what hope the never-ending flight

<BR>Of future days may bring, what chance, what change

<BR>Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers

<BR>For happy though but ill, for ill not worst,

<BR>If we procure not to our selves more woe.

<BR>Thus BELIAL with words cloath'd in reasons garb

<BR>Counsel'd ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath,

<BR>Not peace: and after him thus MAMMON spake.

<BR>Either to disinthrone the King of Heav'n

<BR>We warr, if warr be best, or to regain

<BR>Our own right lost: him to unthrone we then

<BR>May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yeild

<BR>To fickle Chance, and CHAOS judge the strife:

<BR>The former vain to hope argues as vain

<BR>The latter: for what place can be for us

<BR>Within Heav'ns bound, unless Heav'ns Lord supream

<BR>We overpower? Suppose he should relent

<BR>And publish Grace to all, on promise made

<BR>Of new Subjection; with what eyes could we

<BR>Stand in his presence humble, and receive

<BR>Strict Laws impos'd, to celebrate his Throne

<BR>With warbl'd Hymns, and to his Godhead sing

<BR>Forc't Halleluiah's; while he Lordly sits

<BR>Our envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes

<BR>Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers,

<BR>Our servile offerings. This must be our task

<BR>In Heav'n, this our delight; how wearisom

<BR>Eternity so spent in worship paid

<BR>To whom we hate. Let us not then pursue

<BR>By force impossible, by leave obtain'd

<BR>Unacceptable, though in Heav'n, our state

<BR>Of splendid vassalage, but rather seek

<BR>Our own good from our selves, and from our own

<BR>Live to our selves, though in this vast recess,

<BR>Free, and to none accountable, preferring

<BR>Hard liberty before the easie yoke

<BR>Of servile Pomp. Our greatness will appear

<BR>Then most conspicuous, when great things of small,

<BR>Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse

<BR>We can create, and in what place so e're

<BR>Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain

<BR>Through labour and endurance. This deep world

<BR>Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst

<BR>Thick clouds and dark doth Heav'ns all-ruling Sire

<BR>Choose to reside, his Glory unobscur'd,

<BR>And with the Majesty of darkness round

<BR>Covers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar

<BR>Must'ring thir rage, and Heav'n resembles Hell?

<BR>As he our Darkness, cannot we his Light

<BR>Imitate when we please? This Desart soile

<BR>Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold;

<BR>Nor want we skill or art, from whence to raise

<BR>Magnificence; and what can Heav'n shew more?

<BR>Our torments also may in length of time

<BR>Become our Elements, these piercing Fires

<BR>As soft as now severe, our temper chang'd

<BR>Into their temper; which must needs remove

<BR>The sensible of pain. All things invite

<BR>To peaceful Counsels, and the settl'd State

<BR>Of order, how in safety best we may

<BR>Compose our present evils, with regard

<BR>Of what we are and where, dismissing quite

<BR>All thoughts of Warr: ye have what I advise.

<BR>He scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld

<BR>Th' Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain

<BR>The sound of blustring winds, which all night long

<BR>Had rous'd the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull

<BR>Sea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance

<BR>Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay

<BR>After the Tempest: Such applause was heard

<BR>As MAMMON ended, and his Sentence pleas'd,

<BR>Advising peace: for such another Field

<BR>They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear

<BR>Of Thunder and the Sword of MICHAEL

<BR>Wrought still within them; and no less desire

<BR>To found this nether Empire, which might rise

<BR>By pollicy, and long process of time,

<BR>In emulation opposite to Heav'n.

<BR>Which when BEELZEBUB perceiv'd, then whom,

<BR>SATAN except, none higher sat, with grave

<BR>Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem'd

<BR>A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven

<BR>Deliberation sat and publick care;

<BR>And Princely counsel in his face yet shon,

<BR>Majestick though in ruin: sage he stood

<BR>With ATLANTEAN shoulders fit to bear

<BR>The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look

<BR>Drew audience and attention still as Night

<BR>Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake.

<BR>Thrones and imperial Powers, off-spring of heav'n,

<BR>Ethereal Vertues; or these Titles now

<BR>Must we renounce, and changing stile be call'd

<BR>Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote

<BR>Inclines, here to continue, and build up here

<BR>A growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream,

<BR>And know not that the King of Heav'n hath doom'd

<BR>This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat

<BR>Beyond his Potent arm, to live exempt

<BR>From Heav'ns high jurisdiction, in new League

<BR>Banded against his Throne, but to remaine

<BR>In strictest bondage, though thus far remov'd,

<BR>Under th' inevitable curb, reserv'd

<BR>His captive multitude: For he, be sure,

<BR>In highth or depth, still first and last will Reign

<BR>Sole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part

<BR>By our revolt, but over Hell extend

<BR>His Empire, and with Iron Scepter rule

<BR>Us here, as with his Golden those in Heav'n.

<BR>What sit we then projecting Peace and Warr?

<BR>Warr hath determin'd us, and foild with loss

<BR>Irreparable; tearms of peace yet none

<BR>Voutsaf't or sought; for what peace will be giv'n

<BR>To us enslav'd, but custody severe,

<BR>And stripes, and arbitrary punishment

<BR>Inflicted? and what peace can we return,

<BR>But to our power hostility and hate,

<BR>Untam'd reluctance, and revenge though slow,

<BR>Yet ever plotting how the Conquerour least

<BR>May reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce

<BR>In doing what we most in suffering feel?

<BR>Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need

<BR>With dangerous expedition to invade

<BR>Heav'n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege,

<BR>Or ambush from the Deep. What if we find

<BR>Some easier enterprize? There is a place

<BR>(If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav'n

<BR>Err not) another World, the happy seat

<BR>Of som new Race call'd MAN, about this time

<BR>To be created like to us, though less

<BR>In power and excellence, but favour'd more

<BR>Of him who rules above; so was his will

<BR>Pronounc'd among the Gods, and by an Oath,

<BR>That shook Heav'ns whol circumference, confirm'd.

<BR>Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn

<BR>What creatures there inhabit, of what mould,

<BR>Or substance, how endu'd, and what thir Power,

<BR>And where thir weakness, how attempted best,

<BR>By force or suttlety: Though Heav'n be shut,

<BR>And Heav'ns high Arbitrator sit secure

<BR>In his own strength, this place may lye expos'd

<BR>The utmost border of his Kingdom, left

<BR>To their defence who hold it: here perhaps

<BR>Som advantagious act may be achiev'd

<BR>By sudden onset, either with Hell fire

<BR>To waste his whole Creation, or possess

<BR>All as our own, and drive as we were driven,

<BR>The punie habitants, or if not drive,

<BR>Seduce them to our Party, that thir God

<BR>May prove thir foe, and with repenting hand

<BR>Abolish his own works. This would surpass

<BR>Common revenge, and interrupt his joy

<BR>In our Confusion, and our Joy upraise

<BR>In his disturbance; when his darling Sons

<BR>Hurl'd headlong to partake with us, shall curse

<BR>Thir frail Originals, and faded bliss,

<BR>Faded so soon. Advise if this be worth

<BR>Attempting, or to sit in darkness here

<BR>Hatching vain Empires. Thus BEELZEBUB

<BR>Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first devis'd

<BR>By SATAN, and in part propos'd: for whence,

<BR>But from the Author of all ill could Spring

<BR>So deep a malice, to confound the race

<BR>Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell

<BR>To mingle and involve, done all to spite

<BR>The great Creatour? But thir spite still serves

<BR>His glory to augment. The bold design

<BR>Pleas'd highly those infernal States, and joy

<BR>Sparkl'd in all thir eyes; with full assent

<BR>They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews.

<BR>Well have ye judg'd, well ended long debate,

<BR>Synod of Gods, and like to what ye are,

<BR>Great things resolv'd; which from the lowest deep

<BR>Will once more lift us up, in spight of Fate,

<BR>Neerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view

<BR>Of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms

<BR>And opportune excursion we may chance

<BR>Re-enter Heav'n; or else in some milde Zone

<BR>Dwell not unvisited of Heav'ns fair Light

<BR>Secure, and at the brightning Orient beam

<BR>Purge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air,

<BR>To heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires

<BR>Shall breath her balme. But first whom shall we send

<BR>In search of this new world, whom shall we find

<BR>Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet

<BR>The dark unbottom'd infinite Abyss

<BR>And through the palpable obscure find out

<BR>His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight

<BR>Upborn with indefatigable wings

<BR>Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive

<BR>The happy Ile; what strength, what art can then

<BR>Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe

<BR>Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick

<BR>Of Angels watching round? Here he had need

<BR>All circumspection, and we now no less

<BR>Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send,

<BR>The weight of all and our last hope relies.

<BR>This said, he sat; and expectation held

<BR>His look suspence, awaiting who appeer'd

<BR>To second, or oppose, or undertake

<BR>The perilous attempt: but all sat mute,

<BR>Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; &amp; each

<BR>In others count'nance red his own dismay

<BR>Astonisht: none among the choice and prime

<BR>Of those Heav'n-warring Champions could be found

<BR>So hardie as to proffer or accept

<BR>Alone the dreadful voyage; till at last

<BR>SATAN, whom now transcendent glory rais'd

<BR>Above his fellows, with Monarchal pride

<BR>Conscious of highest worth, unmov'd thus spake.

<BR>O Progeny of Heav'n, Empyreal Thrones,

<BR>With reason hath deep silence and demurr

<BR>Seis'd us, though undismaid: long is the way

<BR>And hard, that out of Hell leads up to Light;

<BR>Our prison strong, this huge convex of Fire,

<BR>Outrageous to devour, immures us round

<BR>Ninefold, and gates of burning Adamant

<BR>Barr'd over us prohibit all egress.

<BR>These past, if any pass, the void profound

<BR>Of unessential Night receives him next

<BR>Wide gaping, and with utter loss of being

<BR>Threatens him, plung'd in that abortive gulf.

<BR>If thence he scape into what ever world,

<BR>Or unknown Region, what remains him less

<BR>Then unknown dangers and as hard escape.

<BR>But I should ill become this Throne, O Peers,

<BR>And this Imperial Sov'ranty, adorn'd

<BR>With splendor, arm'd with power, if aught propos'd

<BR>And judg'd of public moment, in the shape

<BR>Of difficulty or danger could deterre

<BR>Me from attempting. Wherefore do I assume

<BR>These Royalties, and not refuse to Reign,

<BR>Refusing to accept as great a share

<BR>Of hazard as of honour, due alike

<BR>To him who Reigns, and so much to him due

<BR>Of hazard more, as he above the rest

<BR>High honourd sits? Go therfore mighty powers,

<BR>Terror of Heav'n, though fall'n; intend at home,

<BR>While here shall be our home, what best may ease

<BR>The present misery, and render Hell

<BR>More tollerable; if there be cure or charm

<BR>To respite or deceive, or slack the pain

<BR>Of this ill Mansion: intermit no watch

<BR>Against a wakeful Foe, while I abroad

<BR>Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek

<BR>Deliverance for us all: this enterprize

<BR>None shall partake with me. Thus saying rose

<BR>The Monarch, and prevented all reply,

<BR>Prudent, least from his resolution rais'd

<BR>Others among the chief might offer now

<BR>(Certain to be refus'd) what erst they feard;

<BR>And so refus'd might in opinion stand

<BR>His rivals, winning cheap the high repute

<BR>Which he through hazard huge must earn. But they

<BR>Dreaded not more th' adventure then his voice

<BR>Forbidding; and at once with him they rose;

<BR>Thir rising all at once was as the sound

<BR>Of Thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend

<BR>With awful reverence prone; and as a God

<BR>Extoll him equal to the highest in Heav'n:

<BR>Nor fail'd they to express how much they prais'd,

<BR>That for the general safety he despis'd

<BR>His own: for neither do the Spirits damn'd

<BR>Loose all thir vertue; least bad men should boast

<BR>Thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites,

<BR>Or close ambition varnisht o're with zeal.

<BR>Thus they thir doubtful consultations dark

<BR>Ended rejoycing in thir matchless Chief:

<BR>As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds

<BR>Ascending, while the North wind sleeps, o'respread

<BR>Heav'ns chearful face, the lowring Element

<BR>Scowls ore the dark'nd lantskip Snow, or showre;

<BR>If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet

<BR>Extend his ev'ning beam, the fields revive,

<BR>The birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds

<BR>Attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings.

<BR>O shame to men! Devil with Devil damn'd

<BR>Firm concord holds, men onely disagree

<BR>Of Creatures rational, though under hope

<BR>Of heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming peace,

<BR>Yet live in hatred, enmitie, and strife

<BR>Among themselves, and levie cruel warres,

<BR>Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy:

<BR>As if (which might induce us to accord)

<BR>Man had not hellish foes anow besides,

<BR>That day and night for his destruction waite.

<BR>The STYGIAN Councel thus dissolv'd; and forth

<BR>In order came the grand infernal Peers,

<BR>Midst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemd

<BR>Alone th' Antagonist of Heav'n, nor less

<BR>Then Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream,

<BR>And God-like imitated State; him round

<BR>A Globe of fierie Seraphim inclos'd

<BR>With bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms.

<BR>Then of thir Session ended they bid cry

<BR>With Trumpets regal sound the great result:

<BR>Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim

<BR>Put to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie

<BR>By Haralds voice explain'd: the hollow Abyss

<BR>Heard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell

<BR>With deafning shout, return'd them loud acclaim.

<BR>Thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais'd

<BR>By false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers

<BR>Disband, and wandring, each his several way

<BR>Pursues, as inclination or sad choice

<BR>Leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find

<BR>Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain

<BR>The irksome hours, till his great Chief return.

<BR>Part on the Plain, or in the Air sublime

<BR>Upon the wing, or in swift race contend,

<BR>As at th' Olympian Games or PYTHIAN fields;

<BR>Part curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the Goal

<BR>With rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form.

<BR>As when to warn proud Cities warr appears

<BR>Wag'd in the troubl'd Skie, and Armies rush

<BR>To Battel in the Clouds, before each Van

<BR>Pric forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir spears

<BR>Till thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms

<BR>From either end of Heav'n the welkin burns.

<BR>Others with vast TYPHOEAN rage more fell

<BR>Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air

<BR>In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar.

<BR>As when ALCIDES from OEALIA Crown'd

<BR>With conquest, felt th' envenom'd robe, and tore

<BR>Through pain up by the roots THESSALIAN Pines,

<BR>And LICHAS from the top of OETA threw

<BR>Into th' EUBOIC Sea. Others more milde,

<BR>Retreated in a silent valley, sing

<BR>With notes Angelical to many a Harp

<BR>Thir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall

<BR>By doom of Battel; and complain that Fate

<BR>Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance.

<BR>Thir song was partial, but the harmony

<BR>(What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?)

<BR>Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment

<BR>The thronging audience. In discourse more sweet

<BR>(For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,)

<BR>Others apart sat on a Hill retir'd,

<BR>In thoughts more elevate, and reason'd high

<BR>Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate,

<BR>Fixt Fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,

<BR>And found no end, in wandring mazes lost.

<BR>Of good and evil much they argu'd then,

<BR>Of happiness and final misery,

<BR>Passion and Apathie, and glory and shame,

<BR>Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie:

<BR>Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm

<BR>Pain for a while or anguish, and excite

<BR>Fallacious hope, or arm th' obdured brest

<BR>With stubborn patience as with triple steel.

<BR>Another part in Squadrons and gross Bands,

<BR>On bold adventure to discover wide

<BR>That dismal world, if any Clime perhaps

<BR>Might yeild them easier habitation, bend

<BR>Four ways thir flying March, along the Banks

<BR>Of four infernal Rivers that disgorge

<BR>Into the burning Lake thir baleful streams;

<BR>Abhorred STYX the flood of deadly hate,

<BR>Sad ACHERON of sorrow, black and deep;

<BR>COCYTUS, nam'd of lamentation loud

<BR>Heard on the ruful stream; fierce PHLEGETON

<BR>Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.

<BR>Farr off from these a slow and silent stream,

<BR>LETHE the River of Oblivion roules

<BR>Her watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks,

<BR>Forthwith his former state and being forgets,

<BR>Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.

<BR>Beyond this flood a frozen Continent

<BR>Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms

<BR>Of Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land

<BR>Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems

<BR>Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice,

<BR>A gulf profound as that SERBONIAN Bog

<BR>Betwixt DAMIATA and mount CASIUS old,

<BR>Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air

<BR>Burns frore, and cold performs th' effect of Fire.

<BR>Thither by harpy-footed Furies hail'd,

<BR>At certain revolutions all the damn'd

<BR>Are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change

<BR>Of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce,

<BR>From Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice

<BR>Thir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine

<BR>Immovable, infixt, and frozen round,

<BR>Periods of time, thence hurried back to fire.

<BR>They ferry over this LETHEAN Sound

<BR>Both to and fro, thir sorrow to augment,

<BR>And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach

<BR>The tempting stream, with one small drop to loose

<BR>In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe,

<BR>All in one moment, and so neer the brink;

<BR>But fate withstands, and to oppose th' attempt

<BR>MEDUSA with GORGONIAN terror guards

<BR>The Ford, and of it self the water flies

<BR>All taste of living wight, as once it fled

<BR>The lip of TANTALUS. Thus roving on

<BR>In confus'd march forlorn, th' adventrous Bands

<BR>With shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast

<BR>View'd first thir lamentable lot, and found

<BR>No rest: through many a dark and drearie Vaile

<BR>They pass'd, and many a Region dolorous,

<BR>O're many a Frozen, many a Fierie Alpe,

<BR>Rocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death,

<BR>A Universe of death, which God by curse

<BR>Created evil, for evil only good,

<BR>Where all life dies, death lives, and nature breeds,

<BR>Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things,

<BR>Abominable, inutterable, and worse

<BR>Then Fables yet have feign'd, or fear conceiv'd,

<BR>GORGONS and HYDRA'S, and CHIMERA'S dire.

<BR>Mean while the Adversary of God and Man,

<BR>SATAN with thoughts inflam'd of highest design,

<BR>Puts on swift wings, and toward the Gates of Hell

<BR>Explores his solitary flight; som times

<BR>He scours the right hand coast, som times the left,

<BR>Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soares

<BR>Up to the fiery concave touring high.

<BR>As when farr off at Sea a Fleet descri'd

<BR>Hangs in the Clouds, by AEQUINOCTIAL Winds

<BR>Close sailing from BENGALA, or the Iles

<BR>Of TERNATE and TIDORE, whence Merchants bring

<BR>Thir spicie Drugs: they on the trading Flood

<BR>Through the wide ETHIOPIAN to the Cape

<BR>Ply stemming nightly toward the Pole. So seem'd

<BR>Farr off the flying Fiend: at last appeer

<BR>Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof,

<BR>And thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass

<BR>Three Iron, three of Adamantine Rock,

<BR>Impenitrable, impal'd with circling fire,

<BR>Yet unconsum'd. Before the Gates there sat

<BR>On either side a formidable shape;

<BR>The one seem'd Woman to the waste, and fair,

<BR>But ended foul in many a scaly fould

<BR>Voluminous and vast, a Serpent arm'd

<BR>With mortal sting: about her middle round

<BR>A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing bark'd

<BR>With wide CERBEREAN mouths full loud, and rung

<BR>A hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep,

<BR>If aught disturb'd thir noyse, into her woomb,

<BR>And kennel there, yet there still bark'd and howl'd

<BR>Within unseen. Farr less abhorrd then these

<BR>Vex'd SCYLLA bathing in the Sea that parts

<BR>CALABRIA from the hoarce TRINACRIAN shore:

<BR>Nor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when call'd

<BR>In secret, riding through the Air she comes

<BR>Lur'd with the smell of infant blood, to dance

<BR>With LAPLAND Witches, while the labouring Moon

<BR>Eclipses at thir charms. The other shape,

<BR>If shape it might be call'd that shape had none

<BR>Distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb,

<BR>Or substance might be call'd that shadow seem'd,

<BR>For each seem'd either; black it stood as Night,

<BR>Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell,

<BR>And shook a dreadful Dart; what seem'd his head

<BR>The likeness of a Kingly Crown had on.

<BR>SATAN was now at hand, and from his seat

<BR>The Monster moving onward came as fast,

<BR>With horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode.

<BR>Th' undaunted Fiend what this might be admir'd,

<BR>Admir'd, not fear'd; God and his Son except,

<BR>Created thing naught vallu'd he nor shun'd;

<BR>And with disdainful look thus first began.

<BR>Whence and what art thou, execrable shape,

<BR>That dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance

<BR>Thy miscreated Front athwart my way

<BR>To yonder Gates? through them I mean to pass,

<BR>That be assur'd, without leave askt of thee:

<BR>Retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof,

<BR>Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heav'n.

<BR>To whom the Goblin full of wrauth reply'd,

<BR>Art thou that Traitor Angel, art thou hee,

<BR>Who first broke peace in Heav'n and Faith, till then

<BR>Unbrok'n, and in proud rebellious Arms

<BR>Drew after him the third part of Heav'ns Sons

<BR>Conjur'd against the highest, for which both Thou

<BR>And they outcast from God, are here condemn'd

<BR>To waste Eternal daies in woe and pain?

<BR>And reck'n'st thou thy self with Spirits of Heav'n,

<BR>Hell-doomd, and breath'st defiance here and scorn,

<BR>Where I reign King, and to enrage thee more,

<BR>Thy King and Lord? Back to thy punishment,

<BR>False fugitive, and to thy speed add wings,

<BR>Least with a whip of Scorpions I pursue

<BR>Thy lingring, or with one stroke of this Dart

<BR>Strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before.

<BR>So spake the grieslie terrour, and in shape,

<BR>So speaking and so threatning, grew ten fold

<BR>More dreadful and deform: on th' other side

<BR>Incenc't with indignation SATAN stood

<BR>Unterrifi'd, and like a Comet burn'd,

<BR>That fires the length of OPHIUCUS huge

<BR>In th' Artick Sky, and from his horrid hair

<BR>Shakes Pestilence and Warr. Each at the Head

<BR>Level'd his deadly aime; thir fatall hands

<BR>No second stroke intend, and such a frown

<BR>Each cast at th' other, as when two black Clouds

<BR>With Heav'ns Artillery fraught, come rattling on

<BR>Over the CASPIAN, then stand front to front

<BR>Hov'ring a space, till Winds the signal blow

<BR>To joyn thir dark Encounter in mid air:

<BR>So frownd the mighty Combatants, that Hell

<BR>Grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood;

<BR>For never but once more was either like

<BR>To meet so great a foe: and now great deeds

<BR>Had been achiev'd, whereof all Hell had rung,

<BR>Had not the Snakie Sorceress that sat

<BR>Fast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key,

<BR>Ris'n, and with hideous outcry rush'd between.

<BR>O Father, what intends thy hand, she cry'd,

<BR>Against thy only Son? What fury O Son,

<BR>Possesses thee to bend that mortal Dart

<BR>Against thy Fathers head? and know'st for whom;

<BR>For him who sits above and laughs the while

<BR>At thee ordain'd his drudge, to execute

<BR>What e're his wrath, which he calls Justice, bids,

<BR>His wrath which one day will destroy ye both.

<BR>She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest

<BR>Forbore, then these to her SATAN return'd:

<BR>So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange

<BR>Thou interposest, that my sudden hand

<BR>Prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds

<BR>What it intends; till first I know of thee,

<BR>What thing thou art, thus double-form'd, and why

<BR>In this infernal Vaile first met thou call'st

<BR>Me Father, and that Fantasm call'st my Son?

<BR>I know thee not, nor ever saw till now

<BR>Sight more detestable then him and thee.

<BR>T' whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate reply'd;

<BR>Hast thou forgot me then, and do I seem

<BR>Now in thine eye so foul, once deemd so fair

<BR>In Heav'n, when at th' Assembly, and in sight

<BR>Of all the Seraphim with thee combin'd

<BR>In bold conspiracy against Heav'ns King,

<BR>All on a sudden miserable pain

<BR>Surpris'd thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm

<BR>In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast

<BR>Threw forth, till on the left side op'ning wide,

<BR>Likest to thee in shape and count'nance bright,

<BR>Then shining heav'nly fair, a Goddess arm'd

<BR>Out of thy head I sprung: amazement seis'd

<BR>All th' Host of Heav'n; back they recoild affraid

<BR>At first, and call'd me SIN, and for a Sign

<BR>Portentous held me; but familiar grown,

<BR>I pleas'd, and with attractive graces won

<BR>The most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft

<BR>Thy self in me thy perfect image viewing

<BR>Becam'st enamour'd, and such joy thou took'st

<BR>With me in secret, that my womb conceiv'd

<BR>A growing burden. Mean while Warr arose,

<BR>And fields were fought in Heav'n; wherein remaind

<BR>(For what could else) to our Almighty Foe

<BR>Cleer Victory, to our part loss and rout

<BR>Through all the Empyrean: down they fell

<BR>Driv'n headlong from the Pitch of Heaven, down

<BR>Into this Deep, and in the general fall

<BR>I also; at which time this powerful Key

<BR>Into my hand was giv'n, with charge to keep

<BR>These Gates for ever shut, which none can pass

<BR>Without my op'ning. Pensive here I sat

<BR>Alone, but long I sat not, till my womb

<BR>Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown

<BR>Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes.

<BR>At last this odious offspring whom thou seest

<BR>Thine own begotten, breaking violent way

<BR>Tore through my entrails, that with fear and pain

<BR>Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew

<BR>Transform'd: but he my inbred enemie

<BR>Forth issu'd, brandishing his fatal Dart

<BR>Made to destroy: I fled, and cry'd out DEATH;

<BR>Hell trembl'd at the hideous Name, and sigh'd

<BR>From all her Caves, and back resounded DEATH.

<BR>I fled, but he pursu'd (though more, it seems,

<BR>Inflam'd with lust then rage) and swifter far,

<BR>Me overtook his mother all dismaid,

<BR>And in embraces forcible and foule

<BR>Ingendring with me, of that rape begot

<BR>These yelling Monsters that with ceasless cry

<BR>Surround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceiv'd

<BR>And hourly born, with sorrow infinite

<BR>To me, for when they list into the womb

<BR>That bred them they return, and howle and gnaw

<BR>My Bowels, their repast; then bursting forth

<BR>Afresh with conscious terrours vex me round,

<BR>That rest or intermission none I find.

<BR>Before mine eyes in opposition sits

<BR>Grim DEATH my Son and foe, who sets them on,

<BR>And me his Parent would full soon devour

<BR>For want of other prey, but that he knows

<BR>His end with mine involvd; and knows that I

<BR>Should prove a bitter Morsel, and his bane,

<BR>When ever that shall be; so Fate pronounc'd.

<BR>But thou O Father, I forewarn thee, shun

<BR>His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope

<BR>To be invulnerable in those bright Arms,

<BR>Though temper'd heav'nly, for that mortal dint,

<BR>Save he who reigns above, none can resist.

<BR>She finish'd, and the suttle Fiend his lore

<BR>Soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth.

<BR>Dear Daughter, since thou claim'st me for thy Sire,

<BR>And my fair Son here showst me, the dear pledge

<BR>Of dalliance had with thee in Heav'n, and joys

<BR>Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change

<BR>Befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know

<BR>I come no enemie, but to set free

<BR>From out this dark and dismal house of pain,

<BR>Both him and thee, and all the heav'nly Host

<BR>Of Spirits that in our just pretenses arm'd

<BR>Fell with us from on high: from them I go

<BR>This uncouth errand sole, and one for all

<BR>My self expose, with lonely steps to tread

<BR>Th' unfounded deep, &amp; through the void immense

<BR>To search with wandring quest a place foretold

<BR>Should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now

<BR>Created vast and round, a place of bliss

<BR>In the Pourlieues of Heav'n, and therein plac't

<BR>A race of upstart Creatures, to supply

<BR>Perhaps our vacant room, though more remov'd,

<BR>Least Heav'n surcharg'd with potent multitude

<BR>Might hap to move new broiles: Be this or aught

<BR>Then this more secret now design'd, I haste

<BR>To know, and this once known, shall soon return,

<BR>And bring ye to the place where Thou and Death

<BR>Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen

<BR>Wing silently the buxom Air, imbalm'd

<BR>With odours; there ye shall be fed and fill'd

<BR>Immeasurably, all things shall be your prey.

<BR>He ceas'd, for both seemd highly pleasd, and Death

<BR>Grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear

<BR>His famine should be fill'd, and blest his mawe

<BR>Destin'd to that good hour: no less rejoyc'd

<BR>His mother bad, and thus bespake her Sire.

<BR>The key of this infernal Pit by due,

<BR>And by command of Heav'ns all-powerful King

<BR>I keep, by him forbidden to unlock

<BR>These Adamantine Gates; against all force

<BR>Death ready stands to interpose his dart,

<BR>Fearless to be o'rematcht by living might.

<BR>But what ow I to his commands above

<BR>Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down

<BR>Into this gloom of TARTARUS profound,

<BR>To sit in hateful Office here confin'd,

<BR>Inhabitant of Heav'n, and heav'nlie-born,

<BR>Here in perpetual agonie and pain,

<BR>With terrors and with clamors compasst round

<BR>Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed:

<BR>Thou art my Father, thou my Author, thou

<BR>My being gav'st me; whom should I obey

<BR>But thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon

<BR>To that new world of light and bliss, among

<BR>The Gods who live at ease, where I shall Reign

<BR>At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems

<BR>Thy daughter and thy darling, without end.

<BR>Thus saying, from her side the fatal Key,

<BR>Sad instrument of all our woe, she took;

<BR>And towards the Gate rouling her bestial train,

<BR>Forthwith the huge Porcullis high up drew,

<BR>Which but her self not all the STYGIAN powers

<BR>Could once have mov'd; then in the key-hole turns

<BR>Th' intricate wards, and every Bolt and Bar

<BR>Of massie Iron or sollid Rock with ease

<BR>Unfast'ns: on a sudden op'n flie

<BR>With impetuous recoile and jarring sound

<BR>Th' infernal dores, and on thir hinges great

<BR>Harsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook

<BR>Of EREBUS. She op'nd, but to shut

<BR>Excel'd her power; the Gates wide op'n stood,

<BR>That with extended wings a Bannerd Host

<BR>Under spread Ensigns marching might pass through

<BR>With Horse and Chariots rankt in loose array;

<BR>So wide they stood, and like a Furnace mouth

<BR>Cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame.

<BR>Before thir eyes in sudden view appear

<BR>The secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark

<BR>Illimitable Ocean without bound,

<BR>Without dimension, where length, breadth, and highth,

<BR>And time and place are lost; where eldest Night

<BR>And CHAOS, Ancestors of Nature, hold

<BR>Eternal ANARCHIE, amidst the noise

<BR>Of endless warrs and by confusion stand.

<BR>For hot, cold, moist, and dry, four Champions fierce

<BR>Strive here for Maistrie, and to Battel bring

<BR>Thir embryon Atoms; they around the flag

<BR>Of each his faction, in thir several Clanns,

<BR>Light-arm'd or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow,

<BR>Swarm populous, unnumber'd as the Sands

<BR>Of BARCA or CYRENE'S torrid soil,

<BR>Levied to side with warring Winds, and poise

<BR>Thir lighter wings. To whom these most adhere,

<BR>Hee rules a moment; CHAOS Umpire sits,

<BR>And by decision more imbroiles the fray

<BR>By which he Reigns: next him high Arbiter

<BR>CHANCE governs all. Into this wilde Abyss,

<BR>The Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave,

<BR>Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire,

<BR>But all these in thir pregnant causes mixt

<BR>Confus'dly, and which thus must ever fight,

<BR>Unless th' Almighty Maker them ordain

<BR>His dark materials to create more Worlds,

<BR>Into this wilde Abyss the warie fiend

<BR>Stood on the brink of Hell and look'd a while,

<BR>Pondering his Voyage; for no narrow frith

<BR>He had to cross. Nor was his eare less peal'd

<BR>With noises loud and ruinous (to compare

<BR>Great things with small) then when BELLONA storms,

<BR>With all her battering Engines bent to rase

<BR>Som Capital City, or less then if this frame

<BR>Of Heav'n were falling, and these Elements

<BR>In mutinie had from her Axle torn

<BR>The stedfast Earth. At last his Sail-broad Vannes

<BR>He spreads for flight, and in the surging smoak

<BR>Uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a League

<BR>As in a cloudy Chair ascending rides

<BR>Audacious, but that seat soon failing, meets

<BR>A vast vacuitie: all unawares

<BR>Fluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops

<BR>Ten thousand fadom deep, and to this hour

<BR>Down had been falling, had not by ill chance

<BR>The strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud

<BR>Instinct with Fire and Nitre hurried him

<BR>As many miles aloft: that furie stay'd,

<BR>Quencht in a Boggie SYRTIS, neither Sea,

<BR>Nor good dry Land: nigh founderd on he fares,

<BR>Treading the crude consistence, half on foot,

<BR>Half flying; behoves him now both Oare and Saile.

<BR>As when a Gryfon through the Wilderness

<BR>With winged course ore Hill or moarie Dale,

<BR>Pursues the ARIMASPIAN, who by stelth

<BR>Had from his wakeful custody purloind

<BR>The guarded Gold: So eagerly the fiend

<BR>Ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,

<BR>With head, hands, wings, or feet pursues his way,

<BR>And swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes:

<BR>At length a universal hubbub wilde

<BR>Of stunning sounds and voices all confus'd

<BR>Born through the hollow dark assaults his eare

<BR>With loudest vehemence: thither he plyes,

<BR>Undaunted to meet there what ever power

<BR>Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss

<BR>Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask

<BR>Which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes

<BR>Bordering on light; when strait behold the Throne

<BR>Of CHAOS, and his dark Pavilion spread

<BR>Wide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthron'd

<BR>Sat Sable-vested Night, eldest of things,

<BR>The consort of his Reign; and by them stood

<BR>ORCUS and ADES, and the dreaded name

<BR>Of DEMOGORGON; Rumor next and Chance,

<BR>And Tumult and Confusion all imbroild,

<BR>And Discord with a thousand various mouths.

<BR>T' whom SATAN turning boldly, thus. Ye Powers

<BR>And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss,

<BR>CHAOS and ANCIENT NIGHT, I come no Spie,

<BR>With purpose to explore or to disturb

<BR>The secrets of your Realm, but by constraint

<BR>Wandring this darksome desart, as my way

<BR>Lies through your spacious Empire up to light,

<BR>Alone, and without guide, half lost, I seek

<BR>What readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds

<BR>Confine with Heav'n; or if som other place

<BR>From your Dominion won, th' Ethereal King

<BR>Possesses lately, thither to arrive

<BR>I travel this profound, direct my course;

<BR>Directed, no mean recompence it brings

<BR>To your behoof, if I that Region lost,

<BR>All usurpation thence expell'd, reduce

<BR>To her original darkness and your sway

<BR>(Which is my present journey) and once more

<BR>Erect the Standerd there of ANCIENT NIGHT;

<BR>Yours be th' advantage all, mine the revenge.

<BR>Thus SATAN; and him thus the Anarch old

<BR>With faultring speech and visage incompos'd

<BR>Answer'd. I know thee, stranger, who thou art,

<BR>That mighty leading Angel, who of late

<BR>Made head against Heav'ns King, though overthrown.

<BR>I saw and heard, for such a numerous host

<BR>Fled not in silence through the frighted deep

<BR>With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout,

<BR>Confusion worse confounded; and Heav'n Gates

<BR>Pourd out by millions her victorious Bands

<BR>Pursuing. I upon my Frontieres here

<BR>Keep residence; if all I can will serve,

<BR>That little which is left so to defend

<BR>Encroacht on still through our intestine broiles

<BR>Weakning the Scepter of old Night: first Hell

<BR>Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath;

<BR>Now lately Heaven and Earth, another World

<BR>Hung ore my Realm, link'd in a golden Chain

<BR>To that side Heav'n from whence your Legions fell:

<BR>If that way be your walk, you have not farr;

<BR>So much the neerer danger; goe and speed;

<BR>Havock and spoil and ruin are my gain.

<BR>He ceas'd; and SATAN staid not to reply,

<BR>But glad that now his Sea should find a shore,

<BR>With fresh alacritie and force renew'd

<BR>Springs upward like a Pyramid of fire

<BR>Into the wilde expanse, and through the shock

<BR>Of fighting Elements, on all sides round

<BR>Environ'd wins his way; harder beset

<BR>And more endanger'd, then when ARGO pass'd

<BR>Through BOSPORUS betwixt the justling Rocks:

<BR>Or when ULYSSES on the Larbord shunnd

<BR>CHARYBDIS, and by th' other whirlpool steard.

<BR>So he with difficulty and labour hard

<BR>Mov'd on, with difficulty and labour hee;

<BR>But hee once past, soon after when man fell,

<BR>Strange alteration! Sin and Death amain

<BR>Following his track, such was the will of Heav'n,

<BR>Pav'd after him a broad and beat'n way

<BR>Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling Gulf

<BR>Tamely endur'd a Bridge of wondrous length

<BR>From Hell continu'd reaching th' utmost Orbe

<BR>Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse

<BR>With easie intercourse pass to and fro

<BR>To tempt or punish mortals, except whom

<BR>God and good Angels guard by special grace.

<BR>But now at last the sacred influence

<BR>Of light appears, and from the walls of Heav'n

<BR>Shoots farr into the bosom of dim Night

<BR>A glimmering dawn; here Nature first begins

<BR>Her fardest verge, and CHAOS to retire

<BR>As from her outmost works a brok'n foe

<BR>With tumult less and with less hostile din,

<BR>That SATAN with less toil, and now with ease

<BR>Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light

<BR>And like a weather-beaten Vessel holds

<BR>Gladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle torn;

<BR>Or in the emptier waste, resembling Air,

<BR>Weighs his spread wings, at leasure to behold

<BR>Farr off th' Empyreal Heav'n, extended wide

<BR>In circuit, undetermind square or round,

<BR>With Opal Towrs and Battlements adorn'd

<BR>Of living Saphire, once his native Seat;

<BR>And fast by hanging in a golden Chain

<BR>This pendant world, in bigness as a Starr

<BR>Of smallest Magnitude close by the Moon.

<BR>Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge,

<BR>Accurst, and in a cursed hour he hies.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Hail holy light, ofspring of Heav'n first-born,

<BR>Or of th' Eternal Coeternal beam

<BR>May I express thee unblam'd? since God is light,

<BR>And never but in unapproached light

<BR>Dwelt from Eternitie, dwelt then in thee,

<BR>Bright effluence of bright essence increate.

<BR>Or hear'st thou rather pure Ethereal stream,

<BR>Whose Fountain who shall tell? before the Sun,

<BR>Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice

<BR>Of God, as with a Mantle didst invest

<BR>The rising world of waters dark and deep,

<BR>Won from the void and formless infinite.

<BR>Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing,

<BR>Escap't the STYGIAN Pool, though long detain'd

<BR>In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight

<BR>Through utter and through middle darkness borne

<BR>With other notes then to th' ORPHEAN Lyre

<BR>I sung of CHAOS and ETERNAL NIGHT,

<BR>Taught by the heav'nly Muse to venture down

<BR>The dark descent, and up to reascend,

<BR>Though hard and rare: thee I revisit safe,

<BR>And feel thy sovran vital Lamp; but thou

<BR>Revisit'st not these eyes, that rowle in vain

<BR>To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn;

<BR>So thick a drop serene hath quencht thir Orbs,

<BR>Or dim suffusion veild. Yet not the more

<BR>Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt

<BR>Cleer Spring, or shadie Grove, or Sunnie Hill,

<BR>Smit with the love of sacred song; but chief

<BR>Thee SION and the flowrie Brooks beneath

<BR>That wash thy hallowd feet, and warbling flow,

<BR>Nightly I visit: nor somtimes forget

<BR>Those other two equal'd with me in Fate,

<BR>So were I equal'd with them in renown,

<BR>Blind THAMYRIS and blind MAEONIDES,

<BR>And TIRESIAS and PHINEUS Prophets old.

<BR>Then feed on thoughts, that voluntarie move

<BR>Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful Bird

<BR>Sings darkling, and in shadiest Covert hid

<BR>Tunes her nocturnal Note. Thus with the Year

<BR>Seasons return, but not to me returns

<BR>Day, or the sweet approach of Ev'n or Morn,

<BR>Or sight of vernal bloom, or Summers Rose,

<BR>Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine;

<BR>But cloud in stead, and ever-during dark

<BR>Surrounds me, from the chearful waies of men

<BR>Cut off, and for the book of knowledg fair

<BR>Presented with a Universal blanc

<BR>Of Natures works to mee expung'd and ras'd,

<BR>And wisdome at one entrance quite shut out.

<BR>So much the rather thou Celestial light

<BR>Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers

<BR>Irradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thence

<BR>Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell

<BR>Of things invisible to mortal sight.

<BR>Now had the Almighty Father from above,

<BR>From the pure Empyrean where he sits

<BR>High Thron'd above all highth, bent down his eye,

<BR>His own works and their works at once to view:

<BR>About him all the Sanctities of Heaven

<BR>Stood thick as Starrs, and from his sight receiv'd

<BR>Beatitude past utterance; on his right

<BR>The radiant image of his Glory sat,

<BR>His onely Son; On Earth he first beheld

<BR>Our two first Parents, yet the onely two

<BR>Of mankind, in the happie Garden plac't,

<BR>Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love,

<BR>Uninterrupted joy, unrivald love

<BR>In blissful solitude; he then survey'd

<BR>Hell and the Gulf between, and SATAN there

<BR>Coasting the wall of Heav'n on this side Night

<BR>In the dun Air sublime, and ready now

<BR>To stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet

<BR>On the bare outside of this World, that seem'd

<BR>Firm land imbosom'd without Firmament,

<BR>Uncertain which, in Ocean or in Air.

<BR>Him God beholding from his prospect high,

<BR>Wherein past, present, future he beholds,

<BR>Thus to his onely Son foreseeing spake.

<BR>Onely begotten Son, seest thou what rage

<BR>Transports our adversarie, whom no bounds

<BR>Prescrib'd, no barrs of Hell, nor all the chains

<BR>Heapt on him there, nor yet the main Abyss

<BR>Wide interrupt can hold; so bent he seems

<BR>On desperat revenge, that shall redound

<BR>Upon his own rebellious head. And now

<BR>Through all restraint broke loose he wings his way

<BR>Not farr off Heav'n, in the Precincts of light,

<BR>Directly towards the new created World,

<BR>And Man there plac't, with purpose to assay

<BR>If him by force he can destroy, or worse,

<BR>By som false guile pervert; and shall pervert;

<BR>For man will heark'n to his glozing lyes,

<BR>And easily transgress the sole Command,

<BR>Sole pledge of his obedience: So will fall

<BR>Hee and his faithless Progenie: whose fault?

<BR>Whose but his own? ingrate, he had of mee

<BR>All he could have; I made him just and right,

<BR>Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.

<BR>Such I created all th' Ethereal Powers

<BR>And Spirits, both them who stood &amp; them who faild;

<BR>Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell.

<BR>Not free, what proof could they have givn sincere

<BR>Of true allegiance, constant Faith or Love,

<BR>Where onely what they needs must do, appeard,

<BR>Not what they would? what praise could they receive?

<BR>What pleasure I from such obedience paid,

<BR>When Will and Reason (Reason also is choice)

<BR>Useless and vain, of freedom both despoild,

<BR>Made passive both, had servd necessitie,

<BR>Not mee. They therefore as to right belongd,

<BR>So were created, nor can justly accuse

<BR>Thir maker, or thir making, or thir Fate;

<BR>As if Predestination over-rul'd

<BR>Thir will, dispos'd by absolute Decree

<BR>Or high foreknowledge; they themselves decreed

<BR>Thir own revolt, not I: if I foreknew,

<BR>Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault,

<BR>Which had no less prov'd certain unforeknown.

<BR>So without least impulse or shadow of Fate,

<BR>Or aught by me immutablie foreseen,

<BR>They trespass, Authors to themselves in all

<BR>Both what they judge and what they choose; for so

<BR>I formd them free, and free they must remain,

<BR>Till they enthrall themselves: I else must change

<BR>Thir nature, and revoke the high Decree

<BR>Unchangeable, Eternal, which ordain'd

<BR>Thir freedom, they themselves ordain'd thir fall.

<BR>The first sort by thir own suggestion fell,

<BR>Self-tempted, self-deprav'd: Man falls deceiv'd

<BR>By the other first: Man therefore shall find grace,

<BR>The other none: in Mercy and Justice both,

<BR>Through Heav'n and Earth, so shall my glorie excel,

<BR>But Mercy first and last shall brightest shine.

<BR>Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fill'd

<BR>All Heav'n, and in the blessed Spirits elect

<BR>Sense of new joy ineffable diffus'd:

<BR>Beyond compare the Son of God was seen

<BR>Most glorious, in him all his Father shon

<BR>Substantially express'd, and in his face

<BR>Divine compassion visibly appeerd,

<BR>Love without end, and without measure Grace,

<BR>Which uttering thus he to his Father spake.

<BR>O Father, gracious was that word which clos'd

<BR>Thy sovran sentence, that Man should find grace;

<BR>For which both Heav'n and Earth shall high extoll

<BR>Thy praises, with th' innumerable sound

<BR>Of Hymns and sacred Songs, wherewith thy Throne

<BR>Encompass'd shall resound thee ever blest.

<BR>For should Man finally be lost, should Man

<BR>Thy creature late so lov'd, thy youngest Son

<BR>Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though joynd

<BR>With his own folly? that be from thee farr,

<BR>That farr be from thee, Father, who art Judge

<BR>Of all things made, and judgest onely right.

<BR>Or shall the Adversarie thus obtain

<BR>His end, and frustrate thine, shall he fulfill

<BR>His malice, and thy goodness bring to naught,

<BR>Or proud return though to his heavier doom,

<BR>Yet with revenge accomplish't and to Hell

<BR>Draw after him the whole Race of mankind,

<BR>By him corrupted? or wilt thou thy self

<BR>Abolish thy Creation, and unmake,

<BR>For him, what for thy glorie thou hast made?

<BR>So should thy goodness and thy greatness both

<BR>Be questiond and blaspheam'd without defence.

<BR>To whom the great Creatour thus reply'd.

<BR>O Son, in whom my Soul hath chief delight,

<BR>Son of my bosom, Son who art alone

<BR>My word, my wisdom, and effectual might,

<BR>All hast thou spok'n as my thoughts are, all

<BR>As my Eternal purpose hath decreed:

<BR>Man shall not quite be lost, but sav'd who will,

<BR>Yet not of will in him, but grace in me

<BR>Freely voutsaft; once more I will renew

<BR>His lapsed powers, though forfeit and enthrall'd

<BR>By sin to foul exorbitant desires;

<BR>Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand

<BR>On even ground against his mortal foe,

<BR>By me upheld, that he may know how frail

<BR>His fall'n condition is, and to me ow

<BR>All his deliv'rance, and to none but me.

<BR>Some I have chosen of peculiar grace

<BR>Elect above the rest; so is my will:

<BR>The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warnd

<BR>Thir sinful state, and to appease betimes

<BR>Th' incensed Deitie, while offerd grace

<BR>Invites; for I will cleer thir senses dark,

<BR>What may suffice, and soft'n stonie hearts

<BR>To pray, repent, and bring obedience due.

<BR>To prayer, repentance, and obedience due,

<BR>Though but endevord with sincere intent,

<BR>Mine eare shall not be slow, mine eye not shut.

<BR>And I will place within them as a guide

<BR>My Umpire CONSCIENCE, whom if they will hear,

<BR>Light after light well us'd they shall attain,

<BR>And to the end persisting, safe arrive.

<BR>This my long sufferance and my day of grace

<BR>They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste;

<BR>But hard be hard'nd, blind be blinded more,

<BR>That they may stumble on, and deeper fall;

<BR>And none but such from mercy I exclude.

<BR>But yet all is not don; Man disobeying,

<BR>Disloyal breaks his fealtie, and sinns

<BR>Against the high Supremacie of Heav'n,

<BR>Affecting God-head, and so loosing all,

<BR>To expiate his Treason hath naught left,

<BR>But to destruction sacred and devote,

<BR>He with his whole posteritie must die,

<BR>Die hee or Justice must; unless for him

<BR>Som other able, and as willing, pay

<BR>The rigid satisfaction, death for death.

<BR>Say Heav'nly Powers, where shall we find such love,

<BR>Which of ye will be mortal to redeem

<BR>Mans mortal crime, and just th' unjust to save,

<BR>Dwels in all Heaven charitie so deare?

<BR>He ask'd, but all the Heav'nly Quire stood mute,

<BR>And silence was in Heav'n: on mans behalf

<BR>Patron or Intercessor none appeerd,

<BR>Much less that durst upon his own head draw

<BR>The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set.

<BR>And now without redemption all mankind

<BR>Must have bin lost, adjudg'd to Death and Hell

<BR>By doom severe, had not the Son of God,

<BR>In whom the fulness dwels of love divine,

<BR>His dearest mediation thus renewd.

<BR>Father, thy word is past, man shall find grace;

<BR>And shall grace not find means, that finds her way,

<BR>The speediest of thy winged messengers,

<BR>To visit all thy creatures, and to all

<BR>Comes unprevented, unimplor'd, unsought,

<BR>Happie for man, so coming; he her aide

<BR>Can never seek, once dead in sins and lost;

<BR>Attonement for himself or offering meet,

<BR>Indebted and undon, hath none to bring:

<BR>Behold mee then, mee for him, life for life

<BR>I offer, on mee let thine anger fall;

<BR>Account mee man; I for his sake will leave

<BR>Thy bosom, and this glorie next to thee

<BR>Freely put off, and for him lastly die

<BR>Well pleas'd, on me let Death wreck all his rage;

<BR>Under his gloomie power I shall not long

<BR>Lie vanquisht; thou hast givn me to possess

<BR>Life in my self for ever, by thee I live,

<BR>Though now to Death I yeild, and am his due

<BR>All that of me can die, yet that debt paid,

<BR>Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsom grave

<BR>His prey, nor suffer my unspotted Soule

<BR>For ever with corruption there to dwell;

<BR>But I shall rise Victorious, and subdue

<BR>My Vanquisher, spoild of his vanted spoile;

<BR>Death his deaths wound shall then receive, &amp; stoop

<BR>Inglorious, of his mortall sting disarm'd.

<BR>I through the ample Air in Triumph high

<BR>Shall lead Hell Captive maugre Hell, and show

<BR>The powers of darkness bound. Thou at the sight

<BR>Pleas'd, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile,

<BR>While by thee rais'd I ruin all my Foes,

<BR>Death last, and with his Carcass glut the Grave:

<BR>Then with the multitude of my redeemd

<BR>Shall enter Heaven long absent, and returne,

<BR>Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud

<BR>Of anger shall remain, but peace assur'd,

<BR>And reconcilement; wrauth shall be no more

<BR>Thenceforth, but in thy presence Joy entire.

<BR>His words here ended, but his meek aspect

<BR>Silent yet spake, and breath'd immortal love

<BR>To mortal men, above which only shon

<BR>Filial obedience: as a sacrifice

<BR>Glad to be offer'd, he attends the will

<BR>Of his great Father. Admiration seis'd

<BR>All Heav'n, what this might mean, &amp; whither tend

<BR>Wondring; but soon th' Almighty thus reply'd:

<BR>O thou in Heav'n and Earth the only peace

<BR>Found out for mankind under wrauth, O thou

<BR>My sole complacence! well thou know'st how dear,

<BR>To me are all my works, nor Man the least

<BR>Though last created, that for him I spare

<BR>Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save,

<BR>By loosing thee a while, the whole Race lost.

<BR>Thou therefore whom thou only canst redeeme,

<BR>Thir Nature also to thy Nature joyne;

<BR>And be thy self Man among men on Earth,

<BR>Made flesh, when time shall be, of Virgin seed,

<BR>By wondrous birth: Be thou in ADAMS room

<BR>The Head of all mankind, though ADAMS Son.

<BR>As in him perish all men, so in thee

<BR>As from a second root shall be restor'd,

<BR>As many as are restor'd, without thee none.

<BR>His crime makes guiltie all his Sons, thy merit

<BR>Imputed shall absolve them who renounce

<BR>Thir own both righteous and unrighteous deeds,

<BR>And live in thee transplanted, and from thee

<BR>Receive new life. So Man, as is most just,

<BR>Shall satisfie for Man, be judg'd and die,

<BR>And dying rise, and rising with him raise

<BR>His Brethren, ransomd with his own dear life.

<BR>So Heav'nly love shal outdoo Hellish hate,

<BR>Giving to death, and dying to redeeme,

<BR>So dearly to redeem what Hellish hate

<BR>So easily destroy'd, and still destroyes

<BR>In those who, when they may, accept not grace.

<BR>Nor shalt thou by descending to assume

<BR>Mans Nature, less'n or degrade thine owne.

<BR>Because thou hast, though Thron'd in highest bliss

<BR>Equal to God, and equally enjoying

<BR>God-like fruition, quitted all to save

<BR>A World from utter loss, and hast been found

<BR>By Merit more then Birthright Son of God,

<BR>Found worthiest to be so by being Good,

<BR>Farr more then Great or High; because in thee

<BR>Love hath abounded more then Glory abounds,

<BR>Therefore thy Humiliation shall exalt

<BR>With thee thy Manhood also to this Throne;

<BR>Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt Reigne

<BR>Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man,

<BR>Anointed universal King; all Power

<BR>I give thee, reign for ever, and assume

<BR>Thy Merits; under thee as Head Supream

<BR>Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions I reduce:

<BR>All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide

<BR>In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell;

<BR>When thou attended gloriously from Heav'n

<BR>Shalt in the Skie appeer, and from thee send

<BR>The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaime

<BR>Thy dread Tribunal: forthwith from all Windes

<BR>The living, and forthwith the cited dead

<BR>Of all past Ages to the general Doom

<BR>Shall hast'n, such a peal shall rouse thir sleep.

<BR>Then all thy Saints assembl'd, thou shalt judge

<BR>Bad men and Angels, they arraignd shall sink

<BR>Beneath thy Sentence; Hell, her numbers full,

<BR>Thenceforth shall be for ever shut. Mean while

<BR>The World shall burn, and from her ashes spring

<BR>New Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell

<BR>And after all thir tribulations long

<BR>See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds,

<BR>With Joy and Love triumphing, and fair Truth.

<BR>Then thou thy regal Scepter shalt lay by,

<BR>For regal Scepter then no more shall need,

<BR>God shall be All in All. But all ye Gods,

<BR>Adore him, who to compass all this dies,

<BR>Adore the Son, and honour him as mee.

<BR>No sooner had th' Almighty ceas't, but all

<BR>The multitude of Angels with a shout

<BR>Loud as from numbers without number, sweet

<BR>As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heav'n rung

<BR>With Jubilee, and loud Hosanna's fill'd

<BR>Th' eternal Regions: lowly reverent

<BR>Towards either Throne they bow, &amp; to the ground

<BR>With solemn adoration down they cast

<BR>Thir Crowns inwove with Amarant and Gold,

<BR>Immortal Amarant, a Flour which once

<BR>In Paradise, fast by the Tree of Life

<BR>Began to bloom, but soon for mans offence

<BR>To Heav'n remov'd where first it grew, there grows,

<BR>And flours aloft shading the Fount of Life,

<BR>And where the river of Bliss through midst of Heavn

<BR>Rowls o're ELISIAN Flours her Amber stream;

<BR>With these that never fade the Spirits Elect

<BR>Bind thir resplendent locks inwreath'd with beams,

<BR>Now in loose Garlands thick thrown off, the bright

<BR>Pavement that like a Sea of Jasper shon

<BR>Impurpl'd with Celestial Roses smil'd.

<BR>Then Crown'd again thir gold'n Harps they took,

<BR>Harps ever tun'd, that glittering by their side

<BR>Like Quivers hung, and with Praeamble sweet

<BR>Of charming symphonie they introduce

<BR>Thir sacred Song, and waken raptures high;

<BR>No voice exempt, no voice but well could joine

<BR>Melodious part, such concord is in Heav'n.

<BR>Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent,

<BR>Immutable, Immortal, Infinite,

<BR>Eternal King; thee Author of all being,

<BR>Fountain of Light, thy self invisible

<BR>Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit'st

<BR>Thron'd inaccessible, but when thou shad'st

<BR>The full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud

<BR>Drawn round about thee like a radiant Shrine,

<BR>Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appeer,

<BR>Yet dazle Heav'n, that brightest Seraphim

<BR>Approach not, but with both wings veil thir eyes.

<BR>Thee next they sang of all Creation first,

<BR>Begotten Son, Divine Similitude,

<BR>In whose conspicuous count'nance, without cloud

<BR>Made visible, th' Almighty Father shines,

<BR>Whom else no Creature can behold; on thee

<BR>Impresst the effulgence of his Glorie abides,

<BR>Transfus'd on thee his ample Spirit rests.

<BR>Hee Heav'n of Heavens and all the Powers therein

<BR>By thee created, and by thee threw down

<BR>Th' aspiring Dominations: thou that day

<BR>Thy Fathers dreadful Thunder didst not spare,

<BR>Nor stop thy flaming Chariot wheels, that shook

<BR>Heav'ns everlasting Frame, while o're the necks

<BR>Thou drov'st of warring Angels disarraid.

<BR>Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaime

<BR>Thee only extold, Son of thy Fathers might,

<BR>To execute fierce vengeance on his foes,

<BR>Not so on Man; him through their malice fall'n,

<BR>Father of Mercie and Grace, thou didst not doome

<BR>So strictly, but much more to pitie encline:

<BR>No sooner did thy dear and onely Son

<BR>Perceive thee purpos'd not to doom frail Man

<BR>So strictly, but much more to pitie enclin'd,

<BR>He to appease thy wrauth, and end the strife

<BR>Of Mercy and Justice in thy face discern'd,

<BR>Regardless of the Bliss wherein hee sat

<BR>Second to thee, offerd himself to die

<BR>For mans offence. O unexampl'd love,

<BR>Love no where to be found less then Divine!

<BR>Hail Son of God, Saviour of Men, thy Name

<BR>Shall be the copious matter of my Song

<BR>Henceforth, and never shall my Harp thy praise

<BR>Forget, nor from thy Fathers praise disjoine.

<BR>Thus they in Heav'n, above the starry Sphear,

<BR>Thir happie hours in joy and hymning spent.

<BR>Mean while upon the firm opacous Globe

<BR>Of this round World, whose first convex divides

<BR>The luminous inferior Orbs, enclos'd

<BR>From CHAOS and th' inroad of Darkness old,

<BR>SATAN alighted walks: a Globe farr off

<BR>It seem'd, now seems a boundless Continent

<BR>Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night

<BR>Starless expos'd, and ever-threatning storms

<BR>Of CHAOS blustring round, inclement skie;

<BR>Save on that side which from the wall of Heav'n

<BR>Though distant farr som small reflection gaines

<BR>Of glimmering air less vext with tempest loud:

<BR>Here walk'd the Fiend at large in spacious field.

<BR>As when a Vultur on IMAUS bred,

<BR>Whose snowie ridge the roving TARTAR bounds,

<BR>Dislodging from a Region scarce of prey

<BR>To gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling Kids

<BR>On Hills where Flocks are fed, flies toward the Springs

<BR>Of GANGES or HYDASPES, INDIAN streams;

<BR>But in his way lights on the barren plaines

<BR>Of SERICANA, where CHINESES drive

<BR>With Sails and Wind thir canie Waggons light:

<BR>So on this windie Sea of Land, the Fiend

<BR>Walk'd up and down alone bent on his prey,

<BR>Alone, for other Creature in this place

<BR>Living or liveless to be found was none,

<BR>None yet, but store hereafter from the earth

<BR>Up hither like Aereal vapours flew

<BR>Of all things transitorie and vain, when Sin

<BR>With vanity had filld the works of men:

<BR>Both all things vain, and all who in vain things

<BR>Built thir fond hopes of Glorie or lasting fame,

<BR>Or happiness in this or th' other life;

<BR>All who have thir reward on Earth, the fruits

<BR>Of painful Superstition and blind Zeal,

<BR>Naught seeking but the praise of men, here find

<BR>Fit retribution, emptie as thir deeds;

<BR>All th' unaccomplisht works of Natures hand,

<BR>Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixt,

<BR>Dissolvd on earth, fleet hither, and in vain,

<BR>Till final dissolution, wander here,

<BR>Not in the neighbouring Moon, as some have dreamd;

<BR>Those argent Fields more likely habitants,

<BR>Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold

<BR>Betwixt th' Angelical and Human kinde:

<BR>Hither of ill-joynd Sons and Daughters born

<BR>First from the ancient World those Giants came

<BR>With many a vain exploit, though then renownd:

<BR>The builders next of BABEL on the Plain

<BR>Of SENNAAR, and still with vain designe

<BR>New BABELS, had they wherewithall, would build:

<BR>Others came single; hee who to be deemd

<BR>A God, leap'd fondly into AETNA flames,

<BR>EMPEDOCLES, and hee who to enjoy

<BR>PLATO'S ELYSIUM, leap'd into the Sea,

<BR>CLEOMBROTUS, and many more too long,

<BR>Embryo's and Idiots, Eremits and Friers

<BR>White, Black and Grey, with all thir trumperie.

<BR>Here Pilgrims roam, that stray'd so farr to seek

<BR>In GOLGOTHA him dead, who lives in Heav'n;

<BR>And they who to be sure of Paradise

<BR>Dying put on the weeds of DOMINIC,

<BR>Or in FRANCISCAN think to pass disguis'd;

<BR>They pass the Planets seven, and pass the fixt,

<BR>And that Crystalline Sphear whose ballance weighs

<BR>The Trepidation talkt, and that first mov'd;

<BR>And now Saint PETER at Heav'ns Wicket seems

<BR>To wait them with his Keys, and now at foot

<BR>Of Heav'ns ascent they lift thir Feet, when loe

<BR>A violent cross wind from either Coast

<BR>Blows them transverse ten thousand Leagues awry

<BR>Into the devious Air; then might ye see

<BR>Cowles, Hoods and Habits with thir wearers tost

<BR>And flutterd into Raggs, then Reliques, Beads,

<BR>Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls,

<BR>The sport of Winds: all these upwhirld aloft

<BR>Fly o're the backside of the World farr off

<BR>Into a LIMBO large and broad, since calld

<BR>The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown

<BR>Long after, now unpeopl'd, and untrod;

<BR>All this dark Globe the Fiend found as he pass'd,

<BR>And long he wanderd, till at last a gleame

<BR>Of dawning light turnd thither-ward in haste

<BR>His travell'd steps; farr distant hee descries

<BR>Ascending by degrees magnificent

<BR>Up to the wall of Heaven a Structure high,

<BR>At top whereof, but farr more rich appeerd

<BR>The work as of a Kingly Palace Gate

<BR>With Frontispice of Diamond and Gold

<BR>Imbellisht, thick with sparkling orient Gemmes

<BR>The Portal shon, inimitable on Earth

<BR>By Model, or by shading Pencil drawn.

<BR>The Stairs were such as whereon JACOB saw

<BR>Angels ascending and descending, bands

<BR>Of Guardians bright, when he from ESAU fled

<BR>To PADAN-ARAM in the field of LUZ,

<BR>Dreaming by night under the open Skie,

<BR>And waking cri'd, This is the Gate of Heav'n.

<BR>Each Stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood

<BR>There alwaies, but drawn up to Heav'n somtimes

<BR>Viewless, and underneath a bright Sea flow'd

<BR>Of Jasper, or of liquid Pearle, whereon

<BR>Who after came from Earth, sayling arriv'd,

<BR>Wafted by Angels, or flew o're the Lake

<BR>Rapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery Steeds.

<BR>The Stairs were then let down, whether to dare

<BR>The Fiend by easie ascent, or aggravate

<BR>His sad exclusion from the dores of Bliss.

<BR>Direct against which op'nd from beneath,

<BR>Just o're the blissful seat of Paradise,

<BR>A passage down to th' Earth, a passage wide,

<BR>Wider by farr then that of after-times

<BR>Over Mount SION, and, though that were large,

<BR>Over the PROMIS'D LAND to God so dear,

<BR>By which, to visit oft those happy Tribes,

<BR>On high behests his Angels to and fro

<BR>Pass'd frequent, and his eye with choice regard

<BR>From PANEAS the fount of JORDANS flood

<BR>To BEERSABA, where the HOLY LAND

<BR>Borders on AEGYPT and the ARABIAN shoare;

<BR>So wide the op'ning seemd, where bounds were set

<BR>To darkness, such as bound the Ocean wave.

<BR>SATAN from hence now on the lower stair

<BR>That scal'd by steps of Gold to Heav'n Gate

<BR>Looks down with wonder at the sudden view

<BR>Of all this World at once. As when a Scout

<BR>Through dark and desart wayes with peril gone

<BR>All night; at last by break of chearful dawne

<BR>Obtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill,

<BR>Which to his eye discovers unaware

<BR>The goodly prospect of some forein land

<BR>First-seen, or some renownd Metropolis

<BR>With glistering Spires and Pinnacles adornd,

<BR>Which now the Rising Sun guilds with his beams.

<BR>Such wonder seis'd, though after Heaven seen,

<BR>The Spirit maligne, but much more envy seis'd

<BR>At sight of all this World beheld so faire.

<BR>Round he surveys, and well might, where he stood

<BR>So high above the circling Canopie

<BR>Of Nights extended shade; from Eastern Point

<BR>Of LIBRA to the fleecie Starr that bears

<BR>ANDROMEDA farr off ATLANTICK Seas

<BR>Beyond th' HORIZON; then from Pole to Pole

<BR>He views in bredth, and without longer pause

<BR>Down right into the Worlds first Region throws

<BR>His flight precipitant, and windes with ease

<BR>Through the pure marble Air his oblique way

<BR>Amongst innumerable Starrs, that shon

<BR>Stars distant, but nigh hand seemd other Worlds,

<BR>Or other Worlds they seemd, or happy Iles,

<BR>Like those HESPERIAN Gardens fam'd of old,

<BR>Fortunate Fields, and Groves and flourie Vales,

<BR>Thrice happy Iles, but who dwelt happy there

<BR>He stayd not to enquire: above them all

<BR>The golden Sun in splendor likest Heaven

<BR>Allur'd his eye: Thither his course he bends

<BR>Through the calm Firmament; but up or downe

<BR>By center, or eccentric, hard to tell,

<BR>Or Longitude, where the great Luminarie

<BR>Alooff the vulgar Constellations thick,

<BR>That from his Lordly eye keep distance due,

<BR>Dispenses Light from farr; they as they move

<BR>Thir Sarry dance in numbers that compute

<BR>Days, months, and years, towards his all-chearing Lamp

<BR>Turn swift their various motions, or are turnd

<BR>By his Magnetic beam, that gently warms

<BR>The Univers, and to each inward part

<BR>With gentle penetration, though unseen,

<BR>Shoots invisible vertue even to the deep:

<BR>So wondrously was set his Station bright.

<BR>There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps

<BR>Astronomer in the Sun's lucent Orbe

<BR>Through his glaz'd Optic Tube yet never saw.

<BR>The place he found beyond expression bright,

<BR>Compar'd with aught on Earth, Medal or Stone;

<BR>Not all parts like, but all alike informd

<BR>Which radiant light, as glowing Iron with fire;

<BR>If mettal, part seemd Gold, part Silver cleer;

<BR>If stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite,

<BR>Rubie or Topaz, to the Twelve that shon

<BR>In AARONS Brest-plate, and a stone besides

<BR>Imagind rather oft then elsewhere seen,

<BR>That stone, or like to that which here below

<BR>Philosophers in vain so long have sought,

<BR>In vain, though by thir powerful Art they binde

<BR>Volatil HERMES, and call up unbound

<BR>In various shapes old PROTEUS from the Sea,

<BR>Draind through a Limbec to his Native forme.

<BR>What wonder then if fields and regions here

<BR>Breathe forth ELIXIR pure, and Rivers run

<BR>Potable Gold, when with one vertuous touch

<BR>Th' Arch-chimic Sun so farr from us remote

<BR>Produces with Terrestrial Humor mixt

<BR>Here in the dark so many precious things

<BR>Of colour glorious and effect so rare?

<BR>Here matter new to gaze the Devil met

<BR>Undazl'd, farr and wide his eye commands,

<BR>For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade,

<BR>But all Sun-shine, as when his Beams at Noon

<BR>Culminate from th' AEQUATOR, as they now

<BR>Shot upward still direct, whence no way round

<BR>Shadow from body opaque can fall, and the Aire,

<BR>No where so cleer, sharp'nd his visual ray

<BR>To objects distant farr, whereby he soon

<BR>Saw within kenn a glorious Angel stand,

<BR>The same whom JOHN saw also in the Sun:

<BR>His back was turnd, but not his brightness hid;

<BR>Of beaming sunnie Raies, a golden tiar

<BR>Circl'd his Head, nor less his Locks behind

<BR>Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings

<BR>Lay waving round; on som great charge imploy'd

<BR>Hee seemd, or fixt in cogitation deep.

<BR>Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope

<BR>To find who might direct his wandring flight

<BR>To Paradise the happie seat of Man,

<BR>His journies end and our beginning woe.

<BR>But first he casts to change his proper shape,

<BR>Which else might work him danger or delay:

<BR>And now a stripling Cherube he appeers,

<BR>Not of the prime, yet such as in his face

<BR>Youth smil'd Celestial, and to every Limb

<BR>Sutable grace diffus'd, so well he feignd;

<BR>Under a Coronet his flowing haire

<BR>In curles on either cheek plaid, wings he wore

<BR>Of many a colourd plume sprinkl'd with Gold,

<BR>His habit fit for speed succinct, and held

<BR>Before his decent steps a Silver wand.

<BR>He drew not nigh unheard, the Angel bright,

<BR>Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turnd,

<BR>Admonisht by his eare, and strait was known

<BR>Th' Arch-Angel URIEL, one of the seav'n

<BR>Who in Gods presence, neerest to his Throne

<BR>Stand ready at command, and are his Eyes

<BR>That run through all the Heav'ns, or down to th' Earth

<BR>Bear his swift errands over moist and dry,

<BR>O're Sea and Land: him SATAN thus accostes;

<BR>URIEL, for thou of those seav'n Spirits that stand

<BR>In sight of God's high Throne, gloriously bright,

<BR>The first art wont his great authentic will

<BR>Interpreter through highest Heav'n to bring,

<BR>Where all his Sons thy Embassie attend;

<BR>And here art likeliest by supream decree

<BR>Like honour to obtain, and as his Eye

<BR>To visit oft this new Creation round;

<BR>Unspeakable desire to see, and know

<BR>All these his wondrous works, but chiefly Man,

<BR>His chief delight and favour, him for whom

<BR>All these his works so wondrous he ordaind,

<BR>Hath brought me from the Quires of Cherubim

<BR>Alone thus wandring. Brightest Seraph tell

<BR>In which of all these shining Orbes hath Man

<BR>His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none,

<BR>But all these shining Orbes his choice to dwell;

<BR>That I may find him, and with secret gaze,

<BR>Or open admiration him behold

<BR>On whom the great Creator hath bestowd

<BR>Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces powrd;

<BR>That both in him and all things, as is meet,

<BR>The Universal Maker we may praise;

<BR>Who justly hath drivn out his Rebell Foes

<BR>To deepest Hell, and to repair that loss

<BR>Created this new happie Race of Men

<BR>To serve him better: wise are all his wayes.

<BR>So spake the false dissembler unperceivd;

<BR>For neither Man nor Angel can discern

<BR>Hypocrisie, the only evil that walks

<BR>Invisible, except to God alone,

<BR>By his permissive will, through Heav'n and Earth:

<BR>And oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps

<BR>At wisdoms Gate, and to simplicitie

<BR>Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill

<BR>Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguil'd

<BR>URIEL, though Regent of the Sun, and held

<BR>The sharpest sighted Spirit of all in Heav'n;

<BR>Who to the fraudulent Impostor foule

<BR>In his uprightness answer thus returnd.

<BR>Faire Angel, thy desire which tends to know

<BR>The works of God, thereby to glorifie

<BR>The great Work-Maister, leads to no excess

<BR>That reaches blame, but rather merits praise

<BR>The more it seems excess, that led thee hither

<BR>From thy Empyreal Mansion thus alone,

<BR>To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps

<BR>Contented with report heare onely in heav'n:

<BR>For wonderful indeed are all his works,

<BR>Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all

<BR>Had in remembrance alwayes with delight;

<BR>But what created mind can comprehend

<BR>Thir number, or the wisdom infinite

<BR>That brought them forth, but hid thir causes deep.

<BR>I saw when at his Word the formless Mass,

<BR>This worlds material mould, came to a heap:

<BR>Confusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar

<BR>Stood rul'd, stood vast infinitude confin'd;

<BR>Till at his second bidding darkness fled,

<BR>Light shon, and order from disorder sprung:

<BR>Swift to thir several Quarters hasted then

<BR>The cumbrous Elements, Earth, Flood, Aire, Fire,

<BR>And this Ethereal quintessence of Heav'n

<BR>Flew upward, spirited with various forms,

<BR>That rowld orbicular, and turnd to Starrs

<BR>Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move;

<BR>Each had his place appointed, each his course,

<BR>The rest in circuit walles this Universe.

<BR>Look downward on that Globe whose hither side

<BR>With light from hence, though but reflected, shines;

<BR>That place is Earth the seat of Man, that light

<BR>His day, which else as th' other Hemisphere

<BR>Night would invade, but there the neighbouring Moon

<BR>(So call that opposite fair Starr) her aide

<BR>Timely interposes, and her monthly round

<BR>Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heav'n;

<BR>With borrowd light her countenance triform

<BR>Hence fills and empties to enlighten th' Earth,

<BR>And in her pale dominion checks the night.

<BR>That spot to which I point is PARADISE,

<BR>ADAMS abode, those loftie shades his Bowre.

<BR>Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires.

<BR>Thus said, he turnd, and SATAN bowing low,

<BR>As to superior Spirits is wont in Heaven,

<BR>Where honour due and reverence none neglects,

<BR>Took leave, and toward the coast of Earth beneath,

<BR>Down from th' Ecliptic, sped with hop'd success,

<BR>Throws his steep flight with many an Aerie wheele,

<BR>Nor staid, till on NIPHATES top he lights.</BLOCKQUOTE>
