<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>There was one point which Anne, on returning to her family,



<P>would have been more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliot's



<P>being in love with Elizabeth, which was, her father's not being



<P>in love with Mrs Clay; and she was very far from easy about it,



<P>when she had been at home a few hours.&nbsp; On going down to breakfast



<P>the next morning, she found there had just been a decent pretence



<P>on the lady's side of meaning to leave them.&nbsp; She could imagine

Mrs Clay



<P>to have said, that "now Miss Anne was come, she could not suppose herself



<P>at all wanted;" for Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper,



<P>"That must not be any reason, indeed.&nbsp; I assure you I feel it none.



<P>She is nothing to me, compared with you;"&nbsp; and she was in full

time



<P>to hear her father say, "My dear madam, this must not be.&nbsp; As yet,



<P>you have seen nothing of Bath.&nbsp; You have been here only to be useful.



<P>You must not run away from us now.&nbsp; You must stay to be acquainted



<P>with Mrs Wallis, the beautiful Mrs Wallis.&nbsp; To your fine mind,



<P>I well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He spoke and looked so much in earnest, that Anne was not surprised



<P>to see Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself.



<P>Her countenance, perhaps, might express some watchfulness;



<P>but the praise of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought



<P>in her sister.&nbsp; The lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties,



<P>and promise to stay.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the course of the same morning, Anne and her father chancing to be



<P>alone together, he began to compliment her on her improved looks;



<P>he thought her "less thin in her person, in her cheeks; her skin,



<P>her complexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher.&nbsp; Had she been



<P>using any thing in particular?"&nbsp; "No, nothing."&nbsp; "Merely Gowland,"



<P>he supposed.&nbsp; "No, nothing at all."&nbsp; "Ha! he was surprised

at that;"



<P>and added, "certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are;



<P>you cannot be better than well; or I should recommend Gowland,



<P>the constant use of Gowland, during the spring months.&nbsp; Mrs Clay

has been



<P>using it at my recommendation, and you see what it has done for her.



<P>You see how it has carried away her freckles."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If Elizabeth could but have heard this!&nbsp; Such personal praise



<P>might have struck her, especially as it did not appear to Anne



<P>that the freckles were at all lessened.&nbsp; But everything must



<P>take its chance.&nbsp; The evil of a marriage would be much diminished,



<P>if Elizabeth were also to marry.&nbsp; As for herself, she might always



<P>command a home with Lady Russell.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lady Russell's composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial



<P>on this point, in her intercourse in Camden Place.&nbsp; The sight of

Mrs Clay



<P>in such favour, and of Anne so overlooked, was a perpetual provocation



<P>to her there; and vexed her as much when she was away, as a person in

Bath



<P>who drinks the water, gets all the new publications, and has



<P>a very large acquaintance, has time to be vexed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As Mr Elliot became known to her, she grew more charitable,



<P>or more indifferent, towards the others.&nbsp; His manners were



<P>an immediate recommendation; and on conversing with him she found



<P>the solid so fully supporting the superficial, that she was at first,



<P>as she told Anne, almost ready to exclaim, "Can this be Mr Elliot?"



<P>and could not seriously picture to herself a more agreeable



<P>or estimable man.&nbsp; Everything united in him; good understanding,



<P>correct opinions, knowledge of the world, and a warm heart.



<P>He had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour,



<P>without pride or weakness; he lived with the liberality of a man of

fortune,



<P>without display; he judged for himself in everything essential,



<P>without defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum.



<P>He was steady, observant, moderate, candid; never run away with by spirits



<P>or by selfishness, which fancied itself strong feeling; and yet,



<P>with a sensibility to what was amiable and lovely, and a value



<P>for all the felicities of domestic life, which characters of



<P>fancied enthusiasm and violent agitation seldom really possess.



<P>She was sure that he had not been happy in marriage.&nbsp; Colonel Wallis



<P>said it, and Lady Russell saw it; but it had been no unhappiness



<P>to sour his mind, nor (she began pretty soon to suspect) to prevent

his



<P>thinking of a second choice.&nbsp; Her satisfaction in Mr Elliot



<P>outweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she



<P>and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently;



<P>and it did not surprise her, therefore, that Lady Russell



<P>should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent, nothing to require



<P>more motives than appeared, in Mr Elliot's great desire of a reconciliation.



<P>In Lady Russell's view, it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot,



<P>at a mature time of life, should feel it a most desirable object,



<P>and what would very generally recommend him among all sensible people,



<P>to be on good terms with the head of his family; the simplest process



<P>in the world of time upon a head naturally clear, and only erring



<P>in the heyday of youth.&nbsp; Anne presumed, however, still to smile

about it,



<P>and at last to mention "Elizabeth."&nbsp; Lady Russell listened, and

looked,



<P>and made only this cautious reply:-- "Elizabeth! very well;



<P>time will explain."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was a reference to the future, which Anne, after a little observation,



<P>felt she must submit to.&nbsp; She could determine nothing at present.



<P>In that house Elizabeth must be first; and she was in the habit



<P>of such general observance as "Miss Elliot," that any particularity



<P>of attention seemed almost impossible.&nbsp; Mr Elliot, too,



<P>it must be remembered, had not been a widower seven months.



<P>A little delay on his side might be very excusable.&nbsp; In fact,



<P>Anne could never see the crape round his hat, without fearing that



<P>she was the inexcusable one, in attributing to him such imaginations;



<P>for though his marriage had not been very happy, still it had existed



<P>so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery



<P>from the awful impression of its being dissolved.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>However it might end, he was without any question their



<P>pleasantest acquaintance in Bath:&nbsp; she saw nobody equal to him;



<P>and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme,



<P>which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again, and to see more

of,



<P>as herself.&nbsp; They went through the particulars of their first meeting



<P>a great many times.&nbsp; He gave her to understand that he had



<P>looked at her with some earnestness.&nbsp; She knew it well;



<P>and she remembered another person's look also.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They did not always think alike.&nbsp; His value for rank and connexion



<P>she perceived was greater than hers.&nbsp; It was not merely complaisance,



<P>it must be a liking to the cause, which made him enter warmly



<P>into her father and sister's solicitudes on a subject which



<P>she thought unworthy to excite them.&nbsp; The Bath paper one morning



<P>announced the arrival of the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple,



<P>and her daughter, the Honourable Miss Carteret; and all the comfort



<P>of No. --, Camden Place, was swept away for many days; for the Dalrymples



<P>(in Anne's opinion, most unfortunately) were cousins of the Elliots;



<P>and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility,



<P>and she must acknowledge herself disappointed.&nbsp; She had hoped



<P>better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life,



<P>and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen;



<P>a wish that they had more pride; for "our cousins Lady Dalrymple



<P>and Miss Carteret;" "our cousins, the Dalrymples," sounded in her ears



<P>all day long.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Walter had once been in company with the late viscount,



<P>but had never seen any of the rest of the family; and the difficulties



<P>of the case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse



<P>by letters of ceremony, ever since the death of that said late viscount,



<P>when, in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter's



<P>at the same time, there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch.



<P>No letter of condolence had been sent to Ireland.&nbsp; The neglect



<P>had been visited on the head of the sinner; for when poor Lady Elliot



<P>died herself, no letter of condolence was received at Kellynch,



<P>and, consequently, there was but too much reason to apprehend



<P>that the Dalrymples considered the relationship as closed.



<P>How to have this anxious business set to rights, and be admitted



<P>as cousins again, was the question:&nbsp; and it was a question which,



<P>in a more rational manner, neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot



<P>thought unimportant.&nbsp; "Family connexions were always worth preserving,



<P>good company always worth seeking; Lady Dalrymple had taken a house,



<P>for three months, in Laura Place, and would be living in style.



<P>She had been at Bath the year before, and Lady Russell had heard her



<P>spoken of as a charming woman.&nbsp; It was very desirable that



<P>the connexion should be renewed, if it could be done, without any



<P>compromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Walter, however, would choose his own means, and at last wrote



<P>a very fine letter of ample explanation, regret, and entreaty,



<P>to his right honourable cousin.&nbsp; Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot



<P>could admire the letter; but it did all that was wanted,



<P>in bringing three lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess.



<P>"She was very much honoured, and should be happy in their acquaintance."



<P>The toils of the business were over, the sweets began.&nbsp; They visited



<P>in Laura Place, they had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple,



<P>and the Honourable Miss Carteret, to be arranged wherever they might



<P>be most visible:&nbsp; and "Our cousins in Laura Place,"--"Our cousin,



<P>Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret," were talked of to everybody.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne was ashamed.&nbsp; Had Lady Dalrymple and her daughter even been



<P>very agreeable, she would still have been ashamed of the agitation



<P>they created, but they were nothing.&nbsp; There was no superiority

of manner,



<P>accomplishment, or understanding.&nbsp; Lady Dalrymple had acquired



<P>the name of "a charming woman," because she had a smile and a civil

answer



<P>for everybody.&nbsp; Miss Carteret, with still less to say, was so plain



<P>and so awkward, that she would never have been tolerated in Camden Place



<P>but for her birth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lady Russell confessed she had expected something better; but yet



<P>"it was an acquaintance worth having;" and when Anne ventured to speak



<P>her opinion of them to Mr Elliot, he agreed to their being nothing



<P>in themselves, but still maintained that, as a family connexion,



<P>as good company, as those who would collect good company around them,



<P>they had their value.&nbsp; Anne smiled and said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever,



<P>well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation;



<P>that is what I call good company."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are mistaken," said he gently, "that is not good company;



<P>that is the best.&nbsp; Good company requires only birth, education,



<P>and manners, and with regard to education is not very nice.



<P>Birth and good manners are essential; but a little learning is



<P>by no means a dangerous thing in good company; on the contrary,



<P>it will do very well.&nbsp; My cousin Anne shakes her head.



<P>She is not satisfied.&nbsp; She is fastidious.&nbsp; My dear cousin"



<P>(sitting down by her), "you have a better right to be fastidious



<P>than almost any other woman I know; but will it answer?



<P>Will it make you happy?&nbsp; Will it not be wiser to accept the society



<P>of those good ladies in Laura Place, and enjoy all the advantages



<P>of the connexion as far as possible?&nbsp; You may depend upon it,



<P>that they will move in the first set in Bath this winter,



<P>and as rank is rank, your being known to be related to them



<P>will have its use in fixing your family (our family let me say)



<P>in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," sighed Anne, "we shall, indeed, be known to be related to them!"



<P>then recollecting herself, and not wishing to be answered, she added,



<P>"I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken



<P>to procure the acquaintance.&nbsp; I suppose" (smiling) "I have more

pride



<P>than any of you; but I confess it does vex me, that we should be



<P>so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged, which we may



<P>be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Pardon me, dear cousin, you are unjust in your own claims.



<P>In London, perhaps, in your present quiet style of living,



<P>it might be as you say:&nbsp; but in Bath; Sir Walter Elliot and his

family



<P>will always be worth knowing:&nbsp; always acceptable as acquaintance."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well," said Anne, "I certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome



<P>which depends so entirely upon place."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I love your indignation," said he; "it is very natural.



<P>But here you are in Bath, and the object is to be established here



<P>with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter

Elliot.



<P>You talk of being proud; I am called proud, I know, and I shall not

wish



<P>to believe myself otherwise; for our pride, if investigated,



<P>would have the same object, I have no doubt, though the kind may seem



<P>a little different.&nbsp; In one point, I am sure, my dear cousin,"



<P>(he continued, speaking lower, though there was no one else in the room)



<P>"in one point, I am sure, we must feel alike.&nbsp; We must feel that



<P>every addition to your father's society, among his equals or superiors,



<P>may be of use in diverting his thoughts from those who are beneath him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He looked, as he spoke, to the seat which Mrs Clay had been



<P>lately occupying:&nbsp; a sufficient explanation of what he particularly

meant;



<P>and though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride,



<P>she was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay; and her conscience



<P>admitted that his wishing to promote her father's getting



<P>great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating

her.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Mr Shepherd, a civil, cautious lawyer, who, whatever might be his hold



<P>or his views on Sir Walter, would rather have the disagreeable



<P>prompted by anybody else, excused himself from offering the slightest

hint,



<P>and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to



<P>the excellent judgement of Lady Russell, from whose known good sense



<P>he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as



<P>he meant to see finally adopted.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject, and gave it



<P>much serious consideration.&nbsp; She was a woman rather of sound than

of



<P>quick abilities, whose difficulties in coming to any decision



<P>in this instance were great, from the opposition of two leading principles.



<P>She was of strict integrity herself, with a delicate sense of honour;



<P>but she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter's feelings, as solicitous



<P>for the credit of the family, as aristocratic in her ideas of what



<P>was due to them, as anybody of sense and honesty could well be.



<P>She was a benevolent, charitable, good woman, and capable of



<P>strong attachments, most correct in her conduct, strict in her notions



<P>of decorum, and with manners that were held a standard of good-breeding.



<P>She had a cultivated mind, and was, generally speaking,



<P>rational and consistent; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry;



<P>she had a value for rank and consequence, which blinded her a little



<P>to the faults of those who possessed them.&nbsp; Herself the widow of



<P>only a knight, she gave the dignity of a baronet all its due;



<P>and Sir Walter, independent of his claims as an old acquaintance,



<P>an attentive neighbour, an obliging landlord, the husband of her



<P>very dear friend, the father of Anne and her sisters, was,



<P>as being Sir Walter, in her apprehension, entitled to a great deal



<P>of compassion and consideration under his present difficulties.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt.&nbsp; But she was



<P>very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him



<P>and Elizabeth. She drew up plans of economy, she made exact calculations,



<P>and she did what nobody else thought of doing:&nbsp; she consulted Anne,



<P>who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest



<P>in the question. She consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her



<P>in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted



<P>to Sir Walter. Every emendation of Anne's had been on the side of



<P>honesty against importance.&nbsp; She wanted more vigorous measures,



<P>a more complete reformation, a quicker release from debt,



<P>a much higher tone of indifference for everything but justice and equity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If we can persuade your father to all this," said Lady Russell,



<P>looking over her paper, "much may be done.&nbsp; If he will adopt



<P>these regulations, in seven years he will be clear; and I hope



<P>we may be able to convince him and Elizabeth, that Kellynch Hall has



<P>a respectability in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions;



<P>and that the true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from



<P>lessened in the eyes of sensible people, by acting like a man of principle.



<P>What will he be doing, in fact, but what very many of our first families



<P>have done, or ought to do?&nbsp; There will be nothing singular in his

case;



<P>and it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering,



<P>as it always does of our conduct.&nbsp; I have great hope of prevailing.



<P>We must be serious and decided; for after all, the person who



<P>has contracted debts must pay them; and though a great deal is due to



<P>the feelings of the gentleman, and the head of a house, like your father,



<P>there is still more due to the character of an honest man."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be proceeding,



<P>his friends to be urging him.&nbsp; She considered it as an act



<P>of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with



<P>all the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments



<P>could secure, and saw no dignity in anything short of it.



<P>She wanted it to be prescribed, and felt as a duty.&nbsp; She rated



<P>Lady Russell's influence highly; and as to the severe degree



<P>of self-denial which her own conscience prompted, she believed



<P>there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete,



<P>than to half a reformation.&nbsp; Her knowledge of her father



<P>and Elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair



<P>of horses would be hardly less painful than of both, and so on,



<P>through the whole list of Lady Russell's too gentle reductions.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>How Anne's more rigid requisitions might have been taken



<P>is of little consequence.&nbsp; Lady Russell's had no success at all:



<P>could not be put up with, were not to be borne. "What! every comfort



<P>of life knocked off!&nbsp; Journeys, London, servants, horses, table--



<P>contractions and restrictions every where!&nbsp; To live no longer



<P>with the decencies even of a private gentleman!&nbsp; No, he would sooner



<P>quit Kellynch Hall at once, than remain in it on such disgraceful terms."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Quit Kellynch Hall."&nbsp; The hint was immediately taken up by Mr

Shepherd,



<P>whose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter's retrenching,



<P>and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done without



<P>a change of abode.&nbsp; "Since the idea had been started in the very

quarter



<P>which ought to dictate, he had no scruple," he said, "in confessing



<P>his judgement to be entirely on that side.&nbsp; It did not appear to

him



<P>that Sir Walter could materially alter his style of living in a house



<P>which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support.



<P>In any other place Sir Walter might judge for himself; and would



<P>be looked up to, as regulating the modes of life in whatever way



<P>he might choose to model his household."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall; and after a very few days more



<P>of doubt and indecision, the great question of whither he should go



<P>was settled, and the first outline of this important change made out.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There had been three alternatives, London, Bath, or another house



<P>in the country.&nbsp; All Anne's wishes had been for the latter.



<P>A small house in their own neighbourhood, where they might still have



<P>Lady Russell's society, still be near Mary, and still have the pleasure



<P>of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch, was the object



<P>of her ambition.&nbsp; But the usual fate of Anne attended her,



<P>in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on.



<P>She disliked Bath, and did not think it agreed with her;



<P>and Bath was to be her home.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Walter had at first thought more of London; but Mr Shepherd felt



<P>that he could not be trusted in London, and had been skillful enough



<P>to dissuade him from it, and make Bath preferred.&nbsp; It was a much

safer



<P>place for a gentleman in his predicament:&nbsp; he might there be important



<P>at comparatively little expense.&nbsp; Two material advantages of Bath



<P>over London had of course been given all their weight:&nbsp; its more

convenient



<P>distance from Kellynch, only fifty miles, and Lady Russell's spending



<P>some part of every winter there; and to the very great satisfaction



<P>of Lady Russell, whose first views on the projected change had been



<P>for Bath, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that



<P>they should lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lady Russell felt obliged to oppose her dear Anne's known wishes.



<P>It would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house



<P>in his own neighbourhood.&nbsp; Anne herself would have found



<P>the mortifications of it more than she foresaw, and to Sir Walter's



<P>feelings they must have been dreadful.&nbsp; And with regard to Anne's



<P>dislike of Bath, she considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising,



<P>first, from the circumstance of her having been three years



<P>at school there, after her mother's death; and secondly,



<P>from her happening to be not in perfectly good spirits the only winter



<P>which she had afterwards spent there with herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lady Russell was fond of Bath, in short, and disposed to think



<P>it must suit them all; and as to her young friend's health,



<P>by passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge,



<P>every danger would be avoided; and it was in fact, a change which must



<P>do both health and spirits good.&nbsp; Anne had been too little from

home,



<P>too little seen. Her spirits were not high.&nbsp; A larger society



<P>would improve them.&nbsp; She wanted her to be more known.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood



<P>for Sir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part,



<P>and a very material part of the scheme, which had been happily



<P>engrafted on the beginning.&nbsp; He was not only to quit his home,



<P>but to see it in the hands of others; a trial of fortitude,



<P>which stronger heads than Sir Walter's have found too much.



<P>Kellynch Hall was to be let.&nbsp; This, however, was a profound secret,



<P>not to be breathed beyond their own circle.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known



<P>to design letting his house.&nbsp; Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the

word



<P>"advertise," but never dared approach it again.&nbsp; Sir Walter spurned



<P>the idea of its being offered in any manner; forbad the slightest hint



<P>being dropped of his having such an intention; and it was only on



<P>the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most



<P>unexceptionable applicant, on his own terms, and as a great favour,



<P>that he would let it at all.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>How quick come the reasons for approving what we like!&nbsp; Lady Russell

had



<P>another excellent one at hand, for being extremely glad that Sir Walter



<P>and his family were to remove from the country.&nbsp; Elizabeth had

been



<P>lately forming an intimacy, which she wished to see interrupted.



<P>It was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd, who had returned,



<P>after an unprosperous marriage, to her father's house, with



<P>the additional burden of two children.&nbsp; She was a clever young

woman,



<P>who understood the art of pleasing--the art of pleasing, at least,



<P>at Kellynch Hall; and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot,



<P>as to have been already staying there more than once, in spite of all



<P>that Lady Russell, who thought it a friendship quite out of place,



<P>could hint of caution and reserve.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lady Russell, indeed, had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth,



<P>and seemed to love her, rather because she would love her,



<P>than because Elizabeth deserved it.&nbsp; She had never received from

her more



<P>than outward attention, nothing beyond the observances of complaisance;



<P>had never succeeded in any point which she wanted to carry,



<P>against previous inclination.&nbsp; She had been repeatedly very earnest



<P>in trying to get Anne included in the visit to London, sensibly open



<P>to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements



<P>which shut her out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured



<P>to give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience;



<P>but always in vain:&nbsp; Elizabeth would go her own way; and never

had she



<P>pursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in



<P>this selection of Mrs Clay; turning from the society of so deserving



<P>a sister, to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought



<P>to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>From situation, Mrs Clay was, in Lady Russell's estimate, a very unequal,



<P>and in her character she believed a very dangerous companion;



<P>and a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind, and bring a choice



<P>of more suitable intimates within Miss Elliot's reach, was therefore



<P>an object of first-rate importance.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>"I must take leave to observe, Sir Walter," said Mr Shepherd



<P>one morning at Kellynch Hall, as he laid down the newspaper,



<P>"that the present juncture is much in our favour.&nbsp; This peace will



<P>be turning all our rich naval officers ashore.&nbsp; They will be



<P>all wanting a home.&nbsp; Could not be a better time, Sir Walter,



<P>for having a choice of tenants, very responsible tenants.



<P>Many a noble fortune has been made during the war.&nbsp; If a rich admiral



<P>were to come in our way, Sir Walter--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He would be a very lucky man, Shepherd," replied Sir Walter;



<P>"that's all I have to remark.&nbsp; A prize indeed would Kellynch Hall



<P>be to him; rather the greatest prize of all, let him have taken



<P>ever so many before; hey, Shepherd?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr Shepherd laughed, as he knew he must, at this wit, and then added--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I presume to observe, Sir Walter, that, in the way of business,



<P>gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with.&nbsp; I have had a little

knowledge



<P>of their methods of doing business; and I am free to confess that they



<P>have very liberal notions, and are as likely to make desirable tenants



<P>as any set of people one should meet with.&nbsp; Therefore, Sir Walter,



<P>what I would take leave to suggest is, that if in consequence of



<P>any rumours getting abroad of your intention; which must be contemplated



<P>as a possible thing, because we know how difficult it is to keep



<P>the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice



<P>and curiosity of the other; consequence has its tax; I, John Shepherd,



<P>might conceal any family-matters that I chose, for nobody would think

it



<P>worth their while to observe me; but Sir Walter Elliot has eyes upon

him



<P>which it may be very difficult to elude; and therefore, thus much



<P>I venture upon, that it will not greatly surprise me if,



<P>with all our caution, some rumour of the truth should get abroad;



<P>in the supposition of which, as I was going to observe, since applications



<P>will unquestionably follow, I should think any from our wealthy



<P>naval commanders particularly worth attending to; and beg leave to add,



<P>that two hours will bring me over at any time, to save you



<P>the trouble of replying."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Walter only nodded.&nbsp; But soon afterwards, rising and pacing

the room,



<P>he observed sarcastically--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There are few among the gentlemen of the navy, I imagine, who would



<P>not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They would look around them, no doubt, and bless their good fortune,"



<P>said Mrs Clay, for Mrs Clay was present:&nbsp; her father had driven

her over,



<P>nothing being of so much use to Mrs Clay's health as a drive to Kellynch:



<P>"but I quite agree with my father in thinking a sailor might be



<P>a very desirable tenant.&nbsp; I have known a good deal of the profession;



<P>and besides their liberality, they are so neat and careful



<P>in all their ways!&nbsp; These valuable pictures of yours, Sir Walter,



<P>if you chose to leave them, would be perfectly safe.&nbsp; Everything

in



<P>and about the house would be taken such excellent care of!



<P>The gardens and shrubberies would be kept in almost as high order



<P>as they are now.&nbsp; You need not be afraid, Miss Elliot, of your

own



<P>sweet flower gardens being neglected."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"As to all that," rejoined Sir Walter coolly, "supposing I were induced



<P>to let my house, I have by no means made up my mind as to the privileges



<P>to be annexed to it.&nbsp; I am not particularly disposed to favour

a tenant.



<P>The park would be open to him of course, and few navy officers,



<P>or men of any other description, can have had such a range;



<P>but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure-grounds,



<P>is another thing.&nbsp; I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies

being



<P>always approachable; and I should recommend Miss Elliot to be on her

guard



<P>with respect to her flower garden.&nbsp; I am very little disposed



<P>to grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary favour,



<P>I assure you, be he sailor or soldier."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a short pause, Mr Shepherd presumed to say--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"In all these cases, there are established usages which



<P>make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant.



<P>Your interest, Sir Walter, is in pretty safe hands.&nbsp; Depend upon

me



<P>for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights.



<P>I venture to hint, that Sir Walter Elliot cannot be half so jealous



<P>for his own, as John Shepherd will be for him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here Anne spoke--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The navy, I think, who have done so much for us, have at least



<P>an equal claim with any other set of men, for all the comforts and



<P>all the privileges which any home can give.&nbsp; Sailors work hard

enough



<P>for their comforts, we must all allow."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very true, very true.&nbsp; What Miss Anne says, is very true,"



<P>was Mr Shepherd's rejoinder, and "Oh! certainly," was his daughter's;



<P>but Sir Walter's remark was, soon afterwards--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The profession has its utility, but I should be sorry to see



<P>any friend of mine belonging to it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed!" was the reply, and with a look of surprise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes; it is in two points offensive to me; I have two strong grounds



<P>of objection to it.&nbsp; First, as being the means of bringing persons



<P>of obscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours



<P>which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly,



<P>as it cuts up a man's youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows

old



<P>sooner than any other man.&nbsp; I have observed it all my life.



<P>A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise



<P>of one whose father, his father might have disdained to speak to,



<P>and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself, than in



<P>any other line.&nbsp; One day last spring, in town, I was in company



<P>with two men, striking instances of what I am talking of;



<P>Lord St Ives, whose father we all know to have been a country curate,



<P>without bread to eat; I was to give place to Lord St Ives,



<P>and a certain Admiral Baldwin, the most deplorable-looking personage



<P>you can imagine; his face the colour of mahogany, rough and rugged



<P>to the last degree; all lines and wrinkles, nine grey hairs of a side,



<P>and nothing but a dab of powder at top.&nbsp; `In the name of heaven,



<P>who is that old fellow?' said I to a friend of mine who was standing

near,



<P>(Sir Basil Morley).&nbsp; `Old fellow!' cried Sir Basil, `it is Admiral

Baldwin.



<P>What do you take his age to be?'&nbsp; `Sixty,' said I, `or perhaps

sixty-two.'



<P>`Forty,' replied Sir Basil, `forty, and no more.'&nbsp; Picture to yourselves



<P>my amazement; I shall not easily forget Admiral Baldwin.



<P>I never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea-faring life can

do;



<P>but to a degree, I know it is the same with them all:&nbsp; they are

all



<P>knocked about, and exposed to every climate, and every weather,



<P>till they are not fit to be seen.&nbsp; It is a pity they are not knocked



<P>on the head at once, before they reach Admiral Baldwin's age."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nay, Sir Walter," cried Mrs Clay, "this is being severe indeed.



<P>Have a little mercy on the poor men.&nbsp; We are not all born to be

handsome.



<P>The sea is no beautifier, certainly; sailors do grow old betimes;



<P>I have observed it; they soon lose the look of youth.&nbsp; But then,



<P>is not it the same with many other professions, perhaps most other?



<P>Soldiers, in active service, are not at all better off:&nbsp; and even

in



<P>the quieter professions, there is a toil and a labour of the mind,



<P>if not of the body, which seldom leaves a man's looks to the natural



<P>effect of time.&nbsp; The lawyer plods, quite care-worn; the physician



<P>is up at all hours, and travelling in all weather; and even



<P>the clergyman--" she stopt a moment to consider what might



<P>do for the clergyman;--"and even the clergyman, you know is obliged



<P>to go into infected rooms, and expose his health and looks to



<P>all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere.&nbsp; In fact, as I have



<P>long been convinced, though every profession is necessary and honourable



<P>in its turn, it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow

any,



<P>who can live in a regular way, in the country, choosing their own hours,



<P>following their own pursuits, and living on their own property,



<P>without the torment of trying for more; it is only their lot, I say,



<P>to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost:



<P>I know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness



<P>when they cease to be quite young."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It seemed as if Mr Shepherd, in this anxiety to bespeak



<P>Sir Walter's good will towards a naval officer as tenant,



<P>had been gifted with foresight; for the very first application



<P>for the house was from an Admiral Croft, with whom he shortly afterwards



<P>fell into company in attending the quarter sessions at Taunton; and

indeed,



<P>he had received a hint of the Admiral from a London correspondent.



<P>By the report which he hastened over to Kellynch to make,



<P>Admiral Croft was a native of Somersetshire, who having acquired



<P>a very handsome fortune, was wishing to settle in his own country,



<P>and had come down to Taunton in order to look at some advertised places



<P>in that immediate neighbourhood, which, however, had not suited him;



<P>that accidentally hearing--(it was just as he had foretold,



<P>Mr Shepherd observed, Sir Walter's concerns could not be kept a secret,)--



<P>accidentally hearing of the possibility of Kellynch Hall being to let,



<P>and understanding his (Mr Shepherd's) connection with the owner,



<P>he had introduced himself to him in order to make particular inquiries,



<P>and had, in the course of a pretty long conference, expressed as strong



<P>an inclination for the place as a man who knew it only by description



<P>could feel; and given Mr Shepherd, in his explicit account of himself,



<P>every proof of his being a most responsible, eligible tenant.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And who is Admiral Croft?" was Sir Walter's cold suspicious inquiry.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr Shepherd answered for his being of a gentleman's family,



<P>and mentioned a place; and Anne, after the little pause which followed,



<P>added--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He is a rear admiral of the white.&nbsp; He was in the Trafalgar action,



<P>and has been in the East Indies since; he was stationed there,



<P>I believe, several years."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then I take it for granted," observed Sir Walter, "that his face



<P>is about as orange as the cuffs and capes of my livery."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr Shepherd hastened to assure him, that Admiral Croft was a very hale,



<P>hearty, well-looking man, a little weather-beaten, to be sure,



<P>but not much, and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour;



<P>not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms, only wanted



<P>a comfortable home, and to get into it as soon as possible;



<P>knew he must pay for his convenience; knew what rent a ready-furnished



<P>house of that consequence might fetch; should not have been surprised



<P>if Sir Walter had asked more; had inquired about the manor;



<P>would be glad of the deputation, certainly, but made no great point

of it;



<P>said he sometimes took out a gun, but never killed; quite the gentleman.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr Shepherd was eloquent on the subject; pointing out all



<P>the circumstances of the Admiral's family, which made him



<P>peculiarly desirable as a tenant.&nbsp; He was a married man,



<P>and without children; the very state to be wished for.&nbsp; A house

was



<P>never taken good care of, Mr Shepherd observed, without a lady:



<P>he did not know, whether furniture might not be in danger of suffering



<P>as much where there was no lady, as where there were many children.



<P>A lady, without a family, was the very best preserver of furniture



<P>in the world.&nbsp; He had seen Mrs Croft, too; she was at Taunton



<P>with the admiral, and had been present almost all the time they were



<P>talking the matter over.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And a very well-spoken, genteel, shrewd lady, she seemed to be,"



<P>continued he; "asked more questions about the house, and terms,



<P>and taxes, than the Admiral himself, and seemed more conversant



<P>with business; and moreover, Sir Walter, I found she was not quite



<P>unconnected in this country, any more than her husband; that is to say,



<P>she is sister to a gentleman who did live amongst us once;



<P>she told me so herself:&nbsp; sister to the gentleman who lived



<P>a few years back at Monkford.&nbsp; Bless me! what was his name?



<P>At this moment I cannot recollect his name, though I have heard it so

lately.



<P>Penelope, my dear, can you help me to the name of the gentleman



<P>who lived at Monkford:&nbsp; Mrs Croft's brother?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Mrs Clay was talking so eagerly with Miss Elliot, that she did not



<P>hear the appeal.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have no conception whom you can mean, Shepherd; I remember



<P>no gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Bless me! how very odd!&nbsp; I shall forget my own name soon, I suppose.



<P>A name that I am so very well acquainted with; knew the gentleman



<P>so well by sight; seen him a hundred times; came to consult me once,



<P>I remember, about a trespass of one of his neighbours; farmer's man



<P>breaking into his orchard; wall torn down; apples stolen;



<P>caught in the fact; and afterwards, contrary to my judgement,



<P>submitted to an amicable compromise.&nbsp; Very odd indeed!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After waiting another moment--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You mean Mr Wentworth, I suppose?" said Anne.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr Shepherd was all gratitude.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Wentworth was the very name!&nbsp; Mr Wentworth was the very man.



<P>He had the curacy of Monkford, you know, Sir Walter, some time back,



<P>for two or three years.&nbsp; Came there about the year ---5, I take

it.



<P>You remember him, I am sure."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Wentworth?&nbsp; Oh! ay,--Mr Wentworth, the curate of Monkford.



<P>You misled me by the term gentleman.&nbsp; I thought you were speaking

of



<P>some man of property:&nbsp; Mr Wentworth was nobody, I remember;



<P>quite unconnected; nothing to do with the Strafford family.



<P>One wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As Mr Shepherd perceived that this connexion of the Crofts did them



<P>no service with Sir Walter, he mentioned it no more; returning,



<P>with all his zeal, to dwell on the circumstances more indisputably



<P>in their favour; their age, and number, and fortune; the high idea



<P>they had formed of Kellynch Hall, and extreme solicitude for



<P>the advantage of renting it; making it appear as if they ranked



<P>nothing beyond the happiness of being the tenants of Sir Walter Elliot:



<P>an extraordinary taste, certainly, could they have been supposed in



<P>the secret of Sir Walter's estimate of the dues of a tenant.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It succeeded, however; and though Sir Walter must ever look with



<P>an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house, and think them



<P>infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest

terms,



<P>he was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the treaty,



<P>and authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft, who still remained



<P>at Taunton, and fix a day for the house being seen.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Walter was not very wise; but still he had experience enough



<P>of the world to feel, that a more unobjectionable tenant,



<P>in all essentials, than Admiral Croft bid fair to be, could hardly offer.



<P>So far went his understanding; and his vanity supplied a little



<P>additional soothing, in the Admiral's situation in life, which was just



<P>high enough, and not too high.&nbsp; "I have let my house to Admiral

Croft,"



<P>would sound extremely well; very much better than to any mere Mr--;



<P>a Mr (save, perhaps, some half dozen in the nation,) always needs



<P>a note of explanation.&nbsp; An admiral speaks his own consequence,



<P>and, at the same time, can never make a baronet look small.



<P>In all their dealings and intercourse, Sir Walter Elliot must ever



<P>have the precedence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nothing could be done without a reference to Elizabeth:



<P>but her inclination was growing so strong for a removal,



<P>that she was happy to have it fixed and expedited by a tenant at hand;



<P>and not a word to suspend decision was uttered by her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr Shepherd was completely empowered to act; and no sooner had



<P>such an end been reached, than Anne, who had been a most attentive listener



<P>to the whole, left the room, to seek the comfort of cool air for her



<P>flushed cheeks; and as she walked along a favourite grove, said,



<P>with a gentle sigh, "A few months more, and he, perhaps,



<P>may be walking here.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>While Sir Walter and Elizabeth were assiduously pushing their



<P>good fortune in Laura Place, Anne was renewing an acquaintance



<P>of a very different description.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had called on her former governess, and had heard from her



<P>of there being an old school-fellow in Bath, who had the two strong

claims



<P>on her attention of past kindness and present suffering.&nbsp; Miss

Hamilton,



<P>now Mrs Smith, had shewn her kindness in one of those periods of her

life



<P>when it had been most valuable.&nbsp; Anne had gone unhappy to school,



<P>grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved,



<P>feeling her separation from home, and suffering as a girl of fourteen,



<P>of strong sensibility and not high spirits, must suffer at such a time;



<P>and Miss Hamilton, three years older than herself, but still from the

want



<P>of near relations and a settled home, remaining another year at school,



<P>had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened



<P>her misery, and could never be remembered with indifference.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Hamilton had left school, had married not long afterwards,



<P>was said to have married a man of fortune, and this was all



<P>that Anne had known of her, till now that their governess's account



<P>brought her situation forward in a more decided but very different form.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was a widow and poor.&nbsp; Her husband had been extravagant;



<P>and at his death, about two years before, had left his affairs



<P>dreadfully involved.&nbsp; She had had difficulties of every sort



<P>to contend with, and in addition to these distresses had been afflicted



<P>with a severe rheumatic fever, which, finally settling in her legs,



<P>had made her for the present a cripple.&nbsp; She had come to Bath



<P>on that account, and was now in lodgings near the hot baths,



<P>living in a very humble way, unable even to afford herself



<P>the comfort of a servant, and of course almost excluded from society.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit



<P>from Miss Elliot would give Mrs Smith, and Anne therefore



<P>lost no time in going.&nbsp; She mentioned nothing of what she had heard,



<P>or what she intended, at home.&nbsp; It would excite no proper interest

there.



<P>She only consulted Lady Russell, who entered thoroughly into her sentiments,



<P>and was most happy to convey her as near to Mrs Smith's lodgings



<P>in Westgate Buildings, as Anne chose to be taken.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The visit was paid, their acquaintance re-established, their interest



<P>in each other more than re-kindled.&nbsp; The first ten minutes



<P>had its awkwardness and its emotion.&nbsp; Twelve years were gone



<P>since they had parted, and each presented a somewhat different person



<P>from what the other had imagined.&nbsp; Twelve years had changed Anne



<P>from the blooming, silent, unformed girl of fifteen, to the elegant



<P>little woman of seven-and-twenty, with every beauty except bloom,



<P>and with manners as consciously right as they were invariably gentle;



<P>and twelve years had transformed the fine-looking, well-grown Miss Hamilton,



<P>in all the glow of health and confidence of superiority, into a poor,



<P>infirm, helpless widow, receiving the visit of her former protegee



<P>as a favour; but all that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon



<P>passed away, and left only the interesting charm of remembering



<P>former partialities and talking over old times.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which



<P>she had almost ventured to depend on, and a disposition to converse



<P>and be cheerful beyond her expectation.&nbsp; Neither the dissipations



<P>of the past--and she had lived very much in the world--nor the restrictions



<P>of the present, neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have



<P>closed her heart or ruined her spirits.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the course of a second visit she talked with great openness,



<P>and Anne's astonishment increased.&nbsp; She could scarcely imagine



<P>a more cheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smith's.&nbsp; She had

been



<P>very fond of her husband:&nbsp; she had buried him.&nbsp; She had been



<P>used to affluence:&nbsp; it was gone.&nbsp; She had no child to connect

her



<P>with life and happiness again, no relations to assist in the arrangement



<P>of perplexed affairs, no health to make all the rest supportable.



<P>Her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour, and a dark bedroom



<P>behind, with no possibility of moving from one to the other without



<P>assistance, which there was only one servant in the house to afford,



<P>and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath.



<P>Yet, in spite of all this, Anne had reason to believe that she had



<P>moments only of languor and depression, to hours of occupation



<P>and enjoyment.&nbsp; How could it be?&nbsp; She watched, observed, reflected,



<P>and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude



<P>or of resignation only.&nbsp; A submissive spirit might be patient,



<P>a strong understanding would supply resolution, but here was something

more;



<P>here was that elasticity of mind, that disposition to be comforted,



<P>that power of turning readily from evil to good, and of finding employment



<P>which carried her out of herself, which was from nature alone.



<P>It was the choicest gift of Heaven; and Anne viewed her friend



<P>as one of those instances in which, by a merciful appointment,



<P>it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There had been a time, Mrs Smith told her, when her spirits



<P>had nearly failed.&nbsp; She could not call herself an invalid now,



<P>compared with her state on first reaching Bath.&nbsp; Then she had,

indeed,



<P>been a pitiable object; for she had caught cold on the journey,



<P>and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again



<P>confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain;



<P>and all this among strangers, with the absolute necessity of having



<P>a regular nurse, and finances at that moment particularly unfit



<P>to meet any extraordinary expense.&nbsp; She had weathered it, however,



<P>and could truly say that it had done her good.&nbsp; It had increased



<P>her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands.



<P>She had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or disinterested



<P>attachment anywhere, but her illness had proved to her that her landlady



<P>had a character to preserve, and would not use her ill; and she had

been



<P>particularly fortunate in her nurse, as a sister of her landlady,



<P>a nurse by profession, and who had always a home in that house



<P>when unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her.



<P>"And she," said Mrs Smith, "besides nursing me most admirably,



<P>has really proved an invaluable acquaintance.&nbsp; As soon as I could



<P>use my hands she taught me to knit, which has been a great amusement;



<P>and she put me in the way of making these little thread-cases,



<P>pin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so busy about,



<P>and which supply me with the means of doing a little good



<P>to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood.



<P>She had a large acquaintance, of course professionally, among those



<P>who can afford to buy, and she disposes of my merchandize.



<P>She always takes the right time for applying.&nbsp; Everybody's heart

is open,



<P>you know, when they have recently escaped from severe pain,



<P>or are recovering the blessing of health, and Nurse Rooke



<P>thoroughly understands when to speak.&nbsp; She is a shrewd, intelligent,



<P>sensible woman.&nbsp; Hers is a line for seeing human nature; and she

has



<P>a fund of good sense and observation, which, as a companion, make her



<P>infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received



<P>`the best education in the world,' know nothing worth attending to.



<P>Call it gossip, if you will, but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour's



<P>leisure to bestow on me, she is sure to have something to relate



<P>that is entertaining and profitable:&nbsp; something that makes one



<P>know one's species better.&nbsp; One likes to hear what is going on,



<P>to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly.



<P>To me, who live so much alone, her conversation, I assure you, is a

treat."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne, far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure, replied,



<P>"I can easily believe it.&nbsp; Women of that class have great opportunities,



<P>and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to.



<P>Such varieties of human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing!



<P>And it is not merely in its follies, that they are well read;



<P>for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be



<P>most interesting or affecting.&nbsp; What instances must pass before

them



<P>of ardent, disinterested, self-denying attachment, of heroism, fortitude,



<P>patience, resignation:&nbsp; of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices



<P>that ennoble us most.&nbsp; A sick chamber may often furnish



<P>the worth of volumes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," said Mrs Smith more doubtingly, "sometimes it may,



<P>though I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe.



<P>Here and there, human nature may be great in times of trial;



<P>but generally speaking, it is its weakness and not its strength



<P>that appears in a sick chamber:&nbsp; it is selfishness and impatience



<P>rather than generosity and fortitude, that one hears of.



<P>There is so little real friendship in the world! and unfortunately"



<P>(speaking low and tremulously) "there are so many who forget



<P>to think seriously till it is almost too late."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne saw the misery of such feelings.&nbsp; The husband had not been



<P>what he ought, and the wife had been led among that part of mankind



<P>which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved.



<P>It was but a passing emotion however with Mrs Smith; she shook it off,



<P>and soon added in a different tone--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present,



<P>will furnish much either to interest or edify me.&nbsp; She is only

nursing



<P>Mrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive,



<P>fashionable woman, I believe; and of course will have nothing to report



<P>but of lace and finery.&nbsp; I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis,

however.



<P>She has plenty of money, and I intend she shall buy all



<P>the high-priced things I have in hand now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne had called several times on her friend, before the existence



<P>of such a person was known in Camden Place.&nbsp; At last, it became

necessary



<P>to speak of her. Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mrs Clay, returned one morning



<P>from Laura Place, with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple



<P>for the same evening, and Anne was already engaged, to spend that evening



<P>in Westgate Buildings.&nbsp; She was not sorry for the excuse.



<P>They were only asked, she was sure, because Lady Dalrymple being



<P>kept at home by a bad cold, was glad to make use of the relationship



<P>which had been so pressed on her; and she declined on her own account



<P>with great alacrity--"She was engaged to spend the evening



<P>with an old schoolfellow."&nbsp; They were not much interested in anything



<P>relative to Anne; but still there were questions enough asked,



<P>to make it understood what this old schoolfellow was; and Elizabeth



<P>was disdainful, and Sir Walter severe.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Westgate Buildings!" said he, "and who is Miss Anne Elliot



<P>to be visiting in Westgate Buildings?&nbsp; A Mrs Smith.&nbsp; A widow

Mrs Smith;



<P>and who was her husband?&nbsp; One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose

names



<P>are to be met with everywhere.&nbsp; And what is her attraction?



<P>That she is old and sickly.&nbsp; Upon my word, Miss Anne Elliot,



<P>you have the most extraordinary taste!&nbsp; Everything that revolts



<P>other people, low company, paltry rooms, foul air, disgusting associations



<P>are inviting to you.&nbsp; But surely you may put off this old lady



<P>till to-morrow:&nbsp; she is not so near her end, I presume,



<P>but that she may hope to see another day.&nbsp; What is her age?&nbsp;

Forty?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, sir, she is not one-and-thirty; but I do not think I can



<P>put off my engagement, because it is the only evening for some time



<P>which will at once suit her and myself.&nbsp; She goes into the warm

bath



<P>to-morrow, and for the rest of the week, you know, we are engaged."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance?" asked Elizabeth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She sees nothing to blame in it," replied Anne; "on the contrary,



<P>she approves it, and has generally taken me when I have



<P>called on Mrs Smith.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance



<P>of a carriage drawn up near its pavement," observed Sir Walter.



<P>"Sir Henry Russell's widow, indeed, has no honours to distinguish her

arms,



<P>but still it is a handsome equipage, and no doubt is well known



<P>to convey a Miss Elliot.&nbsp; A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate

Buildings!



<P>A poor widow barely able to live, between thirty and forty;



<P>a mere Mrs Smith, an every-day Mrs Smith, of all people and all names



<P>in the world, to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot,



<P>and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility



<P>of England and Ireland!&nbsp; Mrs Smith!&nbsp; Such a name!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs Clay, who had been present while all this passed, now thought it



<P>advisable to leave the room, and Anne could have said much,



<P>and did long to say a little in defense of her friend's



<P>not very dissimilar claims to theirs, but her sense of personal respect



<P>to her father prevented her.&nbsp; She made no reply.&nbsp; She left

it



<P>to himself to recollect, that Mrs Smith was not the only widow



<P>in Bath between thirty and forty, with little to live on,



<P>and no sirname of dignity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne kept her appointment; the others kept theirs, and of course



<P>she heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening.



<P>She had been the only one of the set absent, for Sir Walter



<P>and Elizabeth had not only been quite at her ladyship's service themselves,



<P>but had actually been happy to be employed by her in collecting others,



<P>and had been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot;



<P>and Mr Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early,



<P>and Lady Russell had fresh arranged all her evening engagements



<P>in order to wait on her.&nbsp; Anne had the whole history of all that



<P>such an evening could supply from Lady Russell.&nbsp; To her,



<P>its greatest interest must be, in having been very much talked of



<P>between her friend and Mr Elliot; in having been wished for, regretted,



<P>and at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause.



<P>Her kind, compassionate visits to this old schoolfellow,



<P>sick and reduced, seemed to have quite delighted Mr Elliot.



<P>He thought her a most extraordinary young woman; in her temper, manners,



<P>mind, a model of female excellence.&nbsp; He could meet even Lady Russell



<P>in a discussion of her merits; and Anne could not be given to understand



<P>so much by her friend, could not know herself to be so highly rated



<P>by a sensible man, without many of those agreeable sensations



<P>which her friend meant to create.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lady Russell was now perfectly decided in her opinion of Mr Elliot.



<P>She was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of



<P>his deserving her, and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks



<P>which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood,



<P>and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing.



<P>She would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she felt on the

subject,



<P>she would venture on little more than hints of what might be hereafter,



<P>of a possible attachment on his side, of the desirableness of the alliance,



<P>supposing such attachment to be real and returned.&nbsp; Anne heard

her,



<P>and made no violent exclamations; she only smiled, blushed,



<P>and gently shook her head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am no match-maker, as you well know," said Lady Russell,



<P>"being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events



<P>and calculations.&nbsp; I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time

hence



<P>pay his addresses to you, and if you should be disposed to accept him,



<P>I think there would be every possibility of your being happy together.



<P>A most suitable connection everybody must consider it, but I think



<P>it might be a very happy one."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man, and in many respects



<P>I think highly of him," said Anne; "but we should not suit."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lady Russell let this pass, and only said in rejoinder, "I own that



<P>to be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch,



<P>the future Lady Elliot, to look forward and see you occupying



<P>your dear mother's place, succeeding to all her rights,



<P>and all her popularity, as well as to all her virtues, would be



<P>the highest possible gratification to me.&nbsp; You are your mother's

self



<P>in countenance and disposition; and if I might be allowed to fancy you



<P>such as she was, in situation and name, and home, presiding and blessing



<P>in the same spot, and only superior to her in being more highly valued!



<P>My dearest Anne, it would give me more delight than is often felt



<P>at my time of life!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne was obliged to turn away, to rise, to walk to a distant table,



<P>and, leaning there in pretended employment, try to subdue the feelings



<P>this picture excited.&nbsp; For a few moments her imagination and her

heart



<P>were bewitched.&nbsp; The idea of becoming what her mother had been;



<P>of having the precious name of "Lady Elliot" first revived in herself;



<P>of being restored to Kellynch, calling it her home again,



<P>her home for ever, was a charm which she could not immediately resist.



<P>Lady Russell said not another word, willing to leave the matter



<P>to its own operation; and believing that, could Mr Elliot at that moment



<P>with propriety have spoken for himself!--she believed, in short,



<P>what Anne did not believe.&nbsp; The same image of Mr Elliot speaking



<P>for himself brought Anne to composure again.&nbsp; The charm of Kellynch



<P>and of "Lady Elliot" all faded away.&nbsp; She never could accept him.



<P>And it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man



<P>save one; her judgement, on a serious consideration of the possibilities



<P>of such a case was against Mr Elliot.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Though they had now been acquainted a month, she could not be satisfied



<P>that she really knew his character.&nbsp; That he was a sensible man,



<P>an agreeable man, that he talked well, professed good opinions,



<P>seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle, this was all



<P>clear enough.&nbsp; He certainly knew what was right, nor could she

fix



<P>on any one article of moral duty evidently transgressed; but yet she

would



<P>have been afraid to answer for his conduct.&nbsp; She distrusted the

past,



<P>if not the present.&nbsp; The names which occasionally dropt



<P>of former associates, the allusions to former practices and pursuits,



<P>suggested suspicions not favourable of what he had been.



<P>She saw that there had been bad habits; that Sunday travelling



<P>had been a common thing; that there had been a period of his life



<P>(and probably not a short one) when he had been, at least,



<P>careless in all serious matters; and, though he might now think



<P>very differently, who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever,



<P>cautious man, grown old enough to appreciate a fair character?



<P>How could it ever be ascertained that his mind was truly cleansed?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr Elliot was rational, discreet, polished, but he was not open.



<P>There was never any burst of feeling, any warmth of indignation or delight,



<P>at the evil or good of others.&nbsp; This, to Anne, was a decided imperfection.



<P>Her early impressions were incurable.&nbsp; She prized the frank,



<P>the open-hearted, the eager character beyond all others.



<P>Warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still.&nbsp; She felt that she

could



<P>so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked



<P>or said a careless or a hasty thing, than of those whose presence of

mind



<P>never varied, whose tongue never slipped.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr Elliot was too generally agreeable.&nbsp; Various as were the tempers



<P>in her father's house, he pleased them all.&nbsp; He endured too well,



<P>stood too well with every body.&nbsp; He had spoken to her with some



<P>degree of openness of Mrs Clay; had appeared completely to see



<P>what Mrs Clay was about, and to hold her in contempt; and yet



<P>Mrs Clay found him as agreeable as any body.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lady Russell saw either less or more than her young friend,



<P>for she saw nothing to excite distrust.&nbsp; She could not imagine



<P>a man more exactly what he ought to be than Mr Elliot; nor did she



<P>ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive



<P>the hand of her beloved Anne in Kellynch church, in the course of



<P>the following autumn.

<P><B>Chapter 1</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Sir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who,



<P>for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage;



<P>there he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a



<P>distressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and



<P>respect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents;



<P>there any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs



<P>changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over



<P>the almost endless creations of the last century; and there,



<P>if every other leaf were powerless, he could read his own history



<P>with an interest which never failed.&nbsp; This was the page at which



<P>the favorite volume always opened:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL.



<P>"Walter Elliot, born March 1, 1760, married, July 15, 1784, Elizabeth,



<P>daughter of James Stevenson, Esq. of South Park, in the county of



<P>Gloucester, by which lady (who died 1800) he has issue Elizabeth,



<P>born June 1, 1785; Anne, born August 9, 1787; a still-born son,



<P>November 5, 1789; Mary, born November 20, 1791."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer's

hands;



<P>but Sir Walter had improved it by adding, for the information of



<P>himself and his family, these words, after the date of Mary's birth--



<P>"Married, December 16, 1810, Charles, son and heir of Charles



<P>Musgrove, Esq. of Uppercross, in the county of Somerset,"



<P>and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which



<P>he had lost his wife.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable family,



<P>in the usual terms; how it had been first settled in Cheshire;



<P>how mentioned in Dugdale, serving the office of high sheriff,



<P>representing a borough in three successive parliaments,



<P>exertions of loyalty, and dignity of baronet, in the first year



<P>of Charles II, with all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married;



<P>forming altogether two handsome duodecimo pages, and concluding with



<P>the arms and motto:--"Principal seat, Kellynch Hall, in the county



<P>of Somerset," and Sir Walter's handwriting again in this finale:--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Heir presumptive, William Walter Elliot, Esq., great grandson of



<P>the second Sir Walter."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot's character;



<P>vanity of person and of situation.&nbsp; He had been remarkably handsome



<P>in his youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man.



<P>Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did,



<P>nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with



<P>the place he held in society.&nbsp; He considered the blessing of beauty



<P>as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter

Elliot,



<P>who united these gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect



<P>and devotion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His good looks and his rank had one fair claim on his attachment;



<P>since to them he must have owed a wife of very superior character



<P>to any thing deserved by his own.&nbsp; Lady Elliot had been an excellent

woman,



<P>sensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be



<P>pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her Lady Elliot,



<P>had never required indulgence afterwards.--She had humoured,



<P>or softened, or concealed his failings, and promoted his real



<P>respectability for seventeen years; and though not the very happiest



<P>being in the world herself, had found enough in her duties, her friends,



<P>and her children, to attach her to life, and make it no matter of



<P>indifference to her when she was called on to quit them.



<P>--Three girls, the two eldest sixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy



<P>for a mother to bequeath, an awful charge rather, to confide to



<P>the authority and guidance of a conceited, silly father.



<P>She had, however, one very intimate friend, a sensible, deserving woman,



<P>who had been brought, by strong attachment to herself, to settle



<P>close by her, in the village of Kellynch; and on her kindness and advice,



<P>Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help and maintenance of



<P>the good principles and instruction which she had been anxiously



<P>giving her daughters.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This friend, and Sir Walter, did not marry, whatever might have been



<P>anticipated on that head by their acquaintance.&nbsp; Thirteen years



<P>had passed away since Lady Elliot's death, and they were still



<P>near neighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower,



<P>the other a widow.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That Lady Russell, of steady age and character, and extremely



<P>well provided for, should have no thought of a second marriage,



<P>needs no apology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably



<P>discontented when a woman does marry again, than when she does not;



<P>but Sir Walter's continuing in singleness requires explanation.



<P>Be it known then, that Sir Walter, like a good father, (having met with



<P>one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications),



<P>prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters' sake.



<P>For one daughter, his eldest, he would really have given up any thing,



<P>which he had not been very much tempted to do.&nbsp; Elizabeth had succeeded,



<P>at sixteen, to all that was possible, of her mother's rights



<P>and consequence; and being very handsome, and very like himself,



<P>her influence had always been great, and they had gone on together



<P>most happily.&nbsp; His two other children were of very inferior value.



<P>Mary had acquired a little artificial importance, by becoming



<P>Mrs Charles Musgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness



<P>of character, which must have placed her high with any people



<P>of real understanding, was nobody with either father or sister;



<P>her word had no weight, her convenience was always to give way--



<P>she was only Anne.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To Lady Russell, indeed, she was a most dear and highly valued



<P>god-daughter, favourite, and friend.&nbsp; Lady Russell loved them all;



<P>but it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl,



<P>but her bloom had vanished early; and as even in its height,



<P>her father had found little to admire in her, (so totally different



<P>were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own),



<P>there could be nothing in them, now that she was faded and thin,



<P>to excite his esteem. He had never indulged much hope, he had now none,



<P>of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work.



<P>All equality of alliance must rest with Elizabeth, for Mary had merely



<P>connected herself with an old country family of respectability and



<P>large fortune, and had therefore given all the honour and received none:



<P>Elizabeth would, one day or other, marry suitably.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than



<P>she was ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has been



<P>neither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely

any



<P>charm is lost.&nbsp; It was so with Elizabeth, still the same handsome



<P>Miss Elliot that she had begun to be thirteen years ago, and Sir Walter



<P>might be excused, therefore, in forgetting her age, or, at least,



<P>be deemed only half a fool, for thinking himself and Elizabeth



<P>as blooming as ever, amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody

else;



<P>for he could plainly see how old all the rest of his family and



<P>acquaintance were growing.&nbsp; Anne haggard, Mary coarse, every face



<P>in the neighbourhood worsting, and the rapid increase of the crow's

foot



<P>about Lady Russell's temples had long been a distress to him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Elizabeth did not quite equal her father in personal contentment.



<P>Thirteen years had seen her mistress of Kellynch Hall, presiding and



<P>directing with a self-possession and decision which could never have

given



<P>the idea of her being younger than she was.&nbsp; For thirteen years

had



<P>she been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law at home,



<P>and leading the way to the chaise and four, and walking immediately

after



<P>Lady Russell out of all the drawing-rooms and dining-rooms in the country.



<P>Thirteen winters' revolving frosts had seen her opening every ball



<P>of credit which a scanty neighbourhood afforded, and thirteen springs



<P>shewn their blossoms, as she travelled up to London with her father,



<P>for a few weeks' annual enjoyment of the great world.&nbsp; She had



<P>the remembrance of all this, she had the consciousness of being



<P>nine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions;



<P>she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever,



<P>but she felt her approach to the years of danger, and would have rejoiced



<P>to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood within



<P>the next twelvemonth or two.&nbsp; Then might she again take up



<P>the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth,



<P>but now she liked it not.&nbsp; Always to be presented with the date

of



<P>her own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister,



<P>made the book an evil; and more than once, when her father had left

it



<P>open on the table near her, had she closed it, with averted eyes,



<P>and pushed it away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book,



<P>and especially the history of her own family, must ever present



<P>the remembrance of.&nbsp; The heir presumptive, the very William Walter



<P>Elliot, Esq., whose rights had been so generously supported



<P>by her father, had disappointed her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be,



<P>in the event of her having no brother, the future baronet,



<P>meant to marry him, and her father had always meant that she should.



<P>He had not been known to them as a boy; but soon after Lady Elliot's

death,



<P>Sir Walter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures



<P>had not been met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it,



<P>making allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of



<P>their spring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her first bloom,



<P>Mr Elliot had been forced into the introduction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of the

law;



<P>and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable, and every plan in his favour



<P>was confirmed.&nbsp; He was invited to Kellynch Hall; he was talked

of



<P>and expected all the rest of the year; but he never came.

<BR>The following spring he was seen again in town, found equally agreeable,



<P>again encouraged, invited, and expected, and again he did not come;



<P>and the next tidings were that he was married.&nbsp; Instead of pushing



<P>his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot,



<P>he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman



<P>of inferior birth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Walter has resented it.&nbsp; As the head of the house, he felt

that



<P>he ought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man



<P>so publicly by the hand; "For they must have been seen together,"



<P>he observed, "once at Tattersal's, and twice in the lobby of



<P>the House of Commons."&nbsp; His disapprobation was expressed,



<P>but apparently very little regarded.&nbsp; Mr Elliot had attempted no

apology,



<P>and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family,



<P>as Sir Walter considered him unworthy of it:&nbsp; all acquaintance

between



<P>them had ceased.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still, after an interval



<P>of several years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who had liked the man



<P>for himself, and still more for being her father's heir, and whose



<P>strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter



<P>Elliot's eldest daughter.&nbsp; There was not a baronet from A to Z

whom



<P>her feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal.



<P>Yet so miserably had he conducted himself, that though she was



<P>at this present time (the summer of 1814) wearing black ribbons



<P>for his wife, she could not admit him to be worth thinking of again.



<P>The disgrace of his first marriage might, perhaps, as there was



<P>no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring, have been got over,



<P>had he not done worse; but he had, as by the accustomary intervention



<P>of kind friends, they had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully



<P>of them all, most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood



<P>he belonged to, and the honours which were hereafter to be his own.



<P>This could not be pardoned.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Such were Elizabeth Elliot's sentiments and sensations; such the cares



<P>to alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance,



<P>the prosperity and the nothingness of her scene of life;



<P>such the feelings to give interest to a long, uneventful residence



<P>in one country circle, to fill the vacancies which there were no habits



<P>of utility abroad, no talents or accomplishments for home, to occupy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to

be



<P>added to these.&nbsp; Her father was growing distressed for money.



<P>She knew, that when he now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive



<P>the heavy bills of his tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of



<P>Mr Shepherd, his agent, from his thoughts.&nbsp; The Kellynch property

was good,



<P>but not equal to Sir Walter's apprehension of the state required



<P>in its possessor.&nbsp; While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method,



<P>moderation, and economy, which had just kept him within his income;



<P>but with her had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period



<P>he had been constantly exceeding it.&nbsp; It had not been possible



<P>for him to spend less; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot



<P>was imperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was



<P>not only growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often,



<P>that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially,



<P>from his daughter.&nbsp; He had given her some hints of it the last

spring



<P>in town; he had gone so far even as to say, "Can we retrench?



<P>Does it occur to you that there is any one article in which



<P>we can retrench?" and Elizabeth, to do her justice, had, in the first



<P>ardour of female alarm, set seriously to think what could be done,



<P>and had finally proposed these two branches of economy, to cut off



<P>some unnecessary charities, and to refrain from new furnishing



<P>the drawing-room; to which expedients she afterwards added



<P>the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne,



<P>as had been the usual yearly custom.&nbsp; But these measures,



<P>however good in themselves, were insufficient for the real extent



<P>of the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged



<P>to confess to her soon afterwards.&nbsp; Elizabeth had nothing to propose



<P>of deeper efficacy.&nbsp; She felt herself ill-used and unfortunate,



<P>as did her father; and they were neither of them able to devise



<P>any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity,



<P>or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose

of;



<P>but had every acre been alienable, it would have made no difference.

<BR>He had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power,



<P>but he would never condescend to sell.&nbsp; No; he would never disgrace



<P>his name so far.&nbsp; The Kellynch estate should be transmitted whole



<P>and entire, as he had received it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Their two confidential friends, Mr Shepherd, who lived in



<P>the neighbouring market town, and Lady Russell, were called to advise

them;



<P>and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should

be



<P>struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments



<P>and reduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of



<P>any indulgence of taste or pride.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Sir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place,



<P>a lofty dignified situation, such as becomes a man of consequence;



<P>and both he and Elizabeth were settled there, much to their satisfaction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne entered it with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment



<P>of many months, and anxiously saying to herself, "Oh! when shall I



<P>leave you again?"&nbsp; A degree of unexpected cordiality, however,



<P>in the welcome she received, did her good.&nbsp; Her father and sister



<P>were glad to see her, for the sake of shewing her the house and furniture,



<P>and met her with kindness.&nbsp; Her making a fourth, when they



<P>sat down to dinner, was noticed as an advantage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs Clay was very pleasant, and very smiling, but her courtesies and

smiles



<P>were more a matter of course.&nbsp; Anne had always felt that she would



<P>pretend what was proper on her arrival, but the complaisance of the

others



<P>was unlooked for.&nbsp; They were evidently in excellent spirits,



<P>and she was soon to listen to the causes.&nbsp; They had no inclination



<P>to listen to her.&nbsp; After laying out for some compliments of being



<P>deeply regretted in their old neighbourhood, which Anne could not pay,



<P>they had only a few faint enquiries to make, before the talk must be



<P>all their own.&nbsp; Uppercross excited no interest, Kellynch very little:



<P>it was all Bath.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They had the pleasure of assuring her that Bath more than answered



<P>their expectations in every respect.&nbsp; Their house was undoubtedly



<P>the best in Camden Place; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages



<P>over all the others which they had either seen or heard of,



<P>and the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up,



<P>or the taste of the furniture.&nbsp; Their acquaintance was



<P>exceedingly sought after.&nbsp; Everybody was wanting to visit them.



<P>They had drawn back from many introductions, and still were



<P>perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here were funds of enjoyment.&nbsp; Could Anne wonder that her father



<P>and sister were happy?&nbsp; She might not wonder, but she must sigh



<P>that her father should feel no degradation in his change, should see



<P>nothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder,



<P>should find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town;



<P>and she must sigh, and smile, and wonder too, as Elizabeth threw open



<P>the folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room



<P>to the other, boasting of their space; at the possibility of that woman,



<P>who had been mistress of Kellynch Hall, finding extent to be proud of



<P>between two walls, perhaps thirty feet asunder.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But this was not all which they had to make them happy.



<P>They had Mr Elliot too.&nbsp; Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliot.



<P>He was not only pardoned, they were delighted with him.



<P>He had been in Bath about a fortnight; (he had passed through Bath



<P>in November, in his way to London, when the intelligence of



<P>Sir Walter's being settled there had of course reached him,



<P>though only twenty-four hours in the place, but he had not been able



<P>to avail himself of it;) but he had now been a fortnight in Bath,



<P>and his first object on arriving, had been to leave his card



<P>in Camden Place, following it up by such assiduous endeavours to meet,



<P>and when they did meet, by such great openness of conduct,



<P>such readiness to apologize for the past, such solicitude to be received



<P>as a relation again, that their former good understanding



<P>was completely re-established.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They had not a fault to find in him.&nbsp; He had explained away



<P>all the appearance of neglect on his own side.&nbsp; It had originated



<P>in misapprehension entirely.&nbsp; He had never had an idea of



<P>throwing himself off; he had feared that he was thrown off,



<P>but knew not why, and delicacy had kept him silent.&nbsp; Upon the hint



<P>of having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family



<P>and the family honours, he was quite indignant.&nbsp; He, who had ever

boasted



<P>of being an Elliot, and whose feelings, as to connection,



<P>were only too strict to suit the unfeudal tone of the present day.



<P>He was astonished, indeed, but his character and general conduct



<P>must refute it.&nbsp; He could refer Sir Walter to all who knew him;



<P>and certainly, the pains he had been taking on this, the first opportunity



<P>of reconciliation, to be restored to the footing of a relation



<P>and heir-presumptive, was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The circumstances of his marriage, too, were found to admit of



<P>much extenuation.&nbsp; This was an article not to be entered on by

himself;



<P>but a very intimate friend of his, a Colonel Wallis, a highly



<P>respectable man, perfectly the gentleman, (and not an ill-looking man,



<P>Sir Walter added), who was living in very good style in Marlborough



<P>Buildings, and had, at his own particular request, been admitted



<P>to their acquaintance through Mr Elliot, had mentioned one or two things



<P>relative to the marriage, which made a material difference



<P>in the discredit of it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Colonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long, had been well acquainted



<P>also with his wife, had perfectly understood the whole story.



<P>She was certainly not a woman of family, but well educated,



<P>accomplished, rich, and excessively in love with his friend.



<P>There had been the charm.&nbsp; She had sought him.&nbsp; Without that

attraction,



<P>not all her money would have tempted Elliot, and Sir Walter was,



<P>moreover, assured of her having been a very fine woman.



<P>Here was a great deal to soften the business.&nbsp; A very fine woman



<P>with a large fortune, in love with him!&nbsp; Sir Walter seemed to admit

it



<P>as complete apology; and though Elizabeth could not see the circumstance



<P>in quite so favourable a light, she allowed it be a great extenuation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr Elliot had called repeatedly, had dined with them once,



<P>evidently delighted by the distinction of being asked, for they



<P>gave no dinners in general; delighted, in short, by every proof



<P>of cousinly notice, and placing his whole happiness in being



<P>on intimate terms in Camden Place.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne listened, but without quite understanding it.&nbsp; Allowances,



<P>large allowances, she knew, must be made for the ideas of those who

spoke.



<P>She heard it all under embellishment.&nbsp; All that sounded extravagant



<P>or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin



<P>but in the language of the relators.&nbsp; Still, however, she had



<P>the sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared,



<P>in Mr Elliot's wishing, after an interval of so many years,



<P>to be well received by them.&nbsp; In a worldly view, he had nothing

to gain



<P>by being on terms with Sir Walter; nothing to risk by a state of variance.



<P>In all probability he was already the richer of the two,



<P>and the Kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title.



<P>A sensible man, and he had looked like a very sensible man,



<P>why should it be an object to him?&nbsp; She could only offer one solution;



<P>it was, perhaps, for Elizabeth's sake.&nbsp; There might really have

been



<P>a liking formerly, though convenience and accident had drawn him



<P>a different way; and now that he could afford to please himself,



<P>he might mean to pay his addresses to her.&nbsp; Elizabeth was certainly



<P>very handsome, with well-bred, elegant manners, and her character



<P>might never have been penetrated by Mr Elliot, knowing her but in public,



<P>and when very young himself.&nbsp; How her temper and understanding



<P>might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life



<P>was another concern and rather a fearful one.&nbsp; Most earnestly did

she wish



<P>that he might not be too nice, or too observant if Elizabeth



<P>were his object; and that Elizabeth was disposed to believe herself

so,



<P>and that her friend Mrs Clay was encouraging the idea, seemed apparent



<P>by a glance or two between them, while Mr Elliot's frequent visits



<P>were talked of.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne mentioned the glimpses she had had of him at Lyme, but without



<P>being much attended to.&nbsp; "Oh! yes, perhaps, it had been Mr Elliot.



<P>They did not know.&nbsp; It might be him, perhaps."&nbsp; They could

not listen



<P>to her description of him.&nbsp; They were describing him themselves;



<P>Sir Walter especially.&nbsp; He did justice to his very gentlemanlike



<P>appearance, his air of elegance and fashion, his good shaped face,



<P>his sensible eye; but, at the same time, "must lament his being



<P>very much under-hung, a defect which time seemed to have increased;



<P>nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered



<P>almost every feature for the worse.&nbsp; Mr Elliot appeared to think



<P>that he (Sir Walter) was looking exactly as he had done when



<P>they last parted;" but Sir Walter had "not been able to return



<P>the compliment entirely, which had embarrassed him.&nbsp; He did not

mean



<P>to complain, however.&nbsp; Mr Elliot was better to look at than most

men,



<P>and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr Elliot, and his friends in Marlborough Buildings, were talked of



<P>the whole evening.&nbsp; "Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be



<P>introduced to them! and Mr Elliot so anxious that he should!"



<P>and there was a Mrs Wallis, at present known only to them by description,



<P>as she was in daily expectation of her confinement; but Mr Elliot



<P>spoke of her as "a most charming woman, quite worthy of being known



<P>in Camden Place," and as soon as she recovered they were to be acquainted.



<P>Sir Walter thought much of Mrs Wallis; she was said to be



<P>an excessively pretty woman, beautiful.&nbsp; "He longed to see her.



<P>He hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces



<P>he was continually passing in the streets.&nbsp; The worst of Bath was



<P>the number of its plain women.&nbsp; He did not mean to say that there

were



<P>no pretty women, but the number of the plain was out of all proportion.



<P>He had frequently observed, as he walked, that one handsome face



<P>would be followed by thirty, or five-and-thirty frights; and once,



<P>as he had stood in a shop on Bond Street, he had counted



<P>eighty-seven women go by, one after another, without there being



<P>a tolerable face among them.&nbsp; It had been a frosty morning,



<P>to be sure, a sharp frost, which hardly one woman in a thousand



<P>could stand the test of.&nbsp; But still, there certainly were



<P>a dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men!



<P>they were infinitely worse.&nbsp; Such scarecrows as the streets were

full of!



<P>It was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything



<P>tolerable, by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced.



<P>He had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with Colonel Wallis



<P>(who was a fine military figure, though sandy-haired) without observing



<P>that every woman's eye was upon him; every woman's eye was sure to be



<P>upon Colonel Wallis."&nbsp; Modest Sir Walter!&nbsp; He was not allowed



<P>to escape, however.&nbsp; His daughter and Mrs Clay united in hinting



<P>that Colonel Wallis's companion might have as good a figure



<P>as Colonel Wallis, and certainly was not sandy-haired.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How is Mary looking?" said Sir Walter, in the height of his good humour.



<P>"The last time I saw her she had a red nose, but I hope that may not



<P>happen every day."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! no, that must have been quite accidental.&nbsp; In general she

has been



<P>in very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds,



<P>and grow coarse, I would send her a new hat and pelisse."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne was considering whether she should venture to suggest that a gown,



<P>or a cap, would not be liable to any such misuse, when a knock at the

door



<P>suspended everything.&nbsp; "A knock at the door! and so late!



<P>It was ten o'clock.&nbsp; Could it be Mr Elliot?&nbsp; They knew he

was to dine



<P>in Lansdown Crescent.&nbsp; It was possible that he might stop in his

way home



<P>to ask them how they did.&nbsp; They could think of no one else.



<P>Mrs Clay decidedly thought it Mr Elliot's knock."&nbsp; Mrs Clay was

right.



<P>With all the state which a butler and foot-boy could give,



<P>Mr Elliot was ushered into the room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was the same, the very same man, with no difference but of dress.



<P>Anne drew a little back, while the others received his compliments,



<P>and her sister his apologies for calling at so unusual an hour,



<P>but "he could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she



<P>nor her friend had taken cold the day before," &amp;c. &amp;c; which

was



<P>all as politely done, and as politely taken, as possible, but her part



<P>must follow then.&nbsp; Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter;



<P>"Mr Elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter"



<P>(there was no occasion for remembering Mary); and Anne, smiling and



<P>blushing, very becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features



<P>which he had by no means forgotten, and instantly saw, with amusement



<P>at his little start of surprise, that he had not been at all aware



<P>of who she was.&nbsp; He looked completely astonished, but not more

astonished



<P>than pleased; his eyes brightened! and with the most perfect alacrity



<P>he welcomed the relationship, alluded to the past, and entreated



<P>to be received as an acquaintance already.&nbsp; He was quite as good-looking



<P>as he had appeared at Lyme, his countenance improved by speaking,



<P>and his manners were so exactly what they ought to be, so polished,



<P>so easy, so particularly agreeable, that she could compare them



<P>in excellence to only one person's manners.&nbsp; They were not the

same,



<P>but they were, perhaps, equally good.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He sat down with them, and improved their conversation very much.



<P>There could be no doubt of his being a sensible man.&nbsp; Ten minutes



<P>were enough to certify that.&nbsp; His tone, his expressions,



<P>his choice of subject, his knowing where to stop; it was all



<P>the operation of a sensible, discerning mind.&nbsp; As soon as he could,



<P>he began to talk to her of Lyme, wanting to compare opinions



<P>respecting the place, but especially wanting to speak of the circumstance



<P>of their happening to be guests in the same inn at the same time;



<P>to give his own route, understand something of hers, and regret that



<P>he should have lost such an opportunity of paying his respects to her.



<P>She gave him a short account of her party and business at Lyme.



<P>His regret increased as he listened.&nbsp; He had spent his whole



<P>solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs; had heard voices,



<P>mirth continually; thought they must be a most delightful set of people,



<P>longed to be with them, but certainly without the smallest suspicion



<P>of his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself.



<P>If he had but asked who the party were!&nbsp; The name of Musgrove would



<P>have told him enough.&nbsp; "Well, it would serve to cure him of



<P>an absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn,



<P>which he had adopted, when quite a young man, on the principal



<P>of its being very ungenteel to be curious.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty," said he,



<P>"as to what is necessary in manners to make him quite the thing,



<P>are more absurd, I believe, than those of any other set of beings



<P>in the world.&nbsp; The folly of the means they often employ



<P>is only to be equalled by the folly of what they have in view."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But he must not be addressing his reflections to Anne alone:



<P>he knew it; he was soon diffused again among the others,



<P>and it was only at intervals that he could return to Lyme.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His enquiries, however, produced at length an account of the scene



<P>she had been engaged in there, soon after his leaving the place.



<P>Having alluded to "an accident,"&nbsp; he must hear the whole.



<P>When he questioned, Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also,



<P>but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt.



<P>She could only compare Mr Elliot to Lady Russell, in the wish



<P>of really comprehending what had passed, and in the degree of concern



<P>for what she must have suffered in witnessing it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He staid an hour with them.&nbsp; The elegant little clock on the mantel-



<P>piece had struck "eleven with its silver sounds," and the watchman



<P>was beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale,



<P>before Mr Elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there

long.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in



<P>Camden Place could have passed so well!

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Though Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after



<P>Mr and Mrs Musgrove's going than Anne conceived they could have been



<P>at all wanted, they were yet the first of the family to be at home again;



<P>and as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross



<P>they drove over to the Lodge.&nbsp; They had left Louisa beginning to

sit up;



<P>but her head, though clear, was exceedingly weak, and her nerves



<P>susceptible to the highest extreme of tenderness; and though



<P>she might be pronounced to be altogether doing very well,



<P>it was still impossible to say when she might be able to bear



<P>the removal home; and her father and mother, who must return



<P>in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas holidays,



<P>had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her with them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They had been all in lodgings together.&nbsp; Mrs Musgrove had



<P>got Mrs Harville's children away as much as she could, every possible



<P>supply from Uppercross had been furnished, to lighten the inconvenience



<P>to the Harvilles, while the Harvilles had been wanting them



<P>to come to dinner every day; and in short, it seemed to have been



<P>only a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested



<P>and hospitable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mary had had her evils; but upon the whole, as was evident



<P>by her staying so long, she had found more to enjoy than to suffer.



<P>Charles Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her; and when



<P>they dined with the Harvilles there had been only a maid-servant to

wait,



<P>and at first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence;



<P>but then, she had received so very handsome an apology from her



<P>on finding out whose daughter she was, and there had been so much



<P>going on every day, there had been so many walks between their lodgings



<P>and the Harvilles, and she had got books from the library,



<P>and changed them so often, that the balance had certainly been



<P>much in favour of Lyme.&nbsp; She had been taken to Charmouth too,



<P>and she had bathed, and she had gone to church, and there were a great

many



<P>more people to look at in the church at Lyme than at Uppercross;



<P>and all this, joined to the sense of being so very useful,



<P>had made really an agreeable fortnight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne enquired after Captain Benwick, Mary's face was clouded directly.



<P>Charles laughed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! Captain Benwick is very well, I believe, but he is



<P>a very odd young man.&nbsp; I do not know what he would be at.



<P>We asked him to come home with us for a day or two:&nbsp; Charles undertook



<P>to give him some shooting, and he seemed quite delighted, and, for my

part,



<P>I thought it was all settled; when behold! on Tuesday night,



<P>he made a very awkward sort of excuse; `he never shot' and he had



<P>`been quite misunderstood,' and he had promised this and he had



<P>promised that, and the end of it was, I found, that he did not mean

to come.



<P>I suppose he was afraid of finding it dull; but upon my word



<P>I should have thought we were lively enough at the Cottage



<P>for such a heart-broken man as Captain Benwick."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Charles laughed again and said, "Now Mary, you know very well



<P>how it really was.&nbsp; It was all your doing," (turning to Anne.)



<P>"He fancied that if he went with us, he should find you close by:



<P>he fancied everybody to be living in Uppercross; and when he discovered



<P>that Lady Russell lived three miles off, his heart failed him,



<P>and he had not courage to come.&nbsp; That is the fact, upon my honour,



<P>Mary knows it is."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Mary did not give into it very graciously, whether from



<P>not considering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation



<P>to be in love with an Elliot, or from not wanting to believe



<P>Anne a greater attraction to Uppercross than herself, must be



<P>left to be guessed.&nbsp; Anne's good-will, however, was not to be lessened



<P>by what she heard.&nbsp; She boldly acknowledged herself flattered,



<P>and continued her enquiries.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! he talks of you," cried Charles, "in such terms--"



<P>Mary interrupted him. "I declare, Charles, I never heard him



<P>mention Anne twice all the time I was there.&nbsp; I declare, Anne,



<P>he never talks of you at all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No," admitted Charles, "I do not know that he ever does, in a general



<P>way; but however, it is a very clear thing that he admires you exceedingly.



<P>His head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation,



<P>and he wants to talk to you about them; he has found out something or

other



<P>in one of them which he thinks-- oh! I cannot pretend to remember it,



<P>but it was something very fine--I overheard him telling Henrietta



<P>all about it; and then `Miss Elliot' was spoken of in the highest terms!



<P>Now Mary, I declare it was so, I heard it myself, and you were



<P>in the other room.&nbsp; `Elegance, sweetness, beauty.' Oh! there was

no end



<P>of Miss Elliot's charms."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And I am sure," cried Mary, warmly, "it was a very little to his credit,



<P>if he did.&nbsp; Miss Harville only died last June.&nbsp; Such a heart



<P>is very little worth having; is it, Lady Russell?&nbsp; I am sure



<P>you will agree with me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I must see Captain Benwick before I decide," said Lady Russell, smiling.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And that you are very likely to do very soon, I can tell you, ma'am,"



<P>said Charles.&nbsp; "Though he had not nerves for coming away with us,



<P>and setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here,



<P>he will make his way over to Kellynch one day by himself,



<P>you may depend on it.&nbsp; I told him the distance and the road,



<P>and I told him of the church's being so very well worth seeing;



<P>for as he has a taste for those sort of things, I thought that would



<P>be a good excuse, and he listened with all his understanding and soul;



<P>and I am sure from his manner that you will have him calling here soon.



<P>So, I give you notice, Lady Russell."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Any acquaintance of Anne's will always be welcome to me,"



<P>was Lady Russell's kind answer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! as to being Anne's acquaintance," said Mary, "I think he is rather



<P>my acquaintance, for I have been seeing him every day this last fortnight."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, as your joint acquaintance, then, I shall be very happy



<P>to see Captain Benwick."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You will not find anything very agreeable in him, I assure you, ma'am.



<P>He is one of the dullest young men that ever lived.&nbsp; He has walked

with me,



<P>sometimes, from one end of the sands to the other, without saying a

word.



<P>He is not at all a well-bred young man.&nbsp; I am sure you will not

like him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There we differ, Mary," said Anne.&nbsp; "I think Lady Russell would

like him.



<P>I think she would be so much pleased with his mind, that she would



<P>very soon see no deficiency in his manner."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So do I, Anne," said Charles.&nbsp; "I am sure Lady Russell would like

him.



<P>He is just Lady Russell's sort.&nbsp; Give him a book, and he will



<P>read all day long."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, that he will!" exclaimed Mary, tauntingly.&nbsp; "He will sit

poring



<P>over his book, and not know when a person speaks to him, or when one



<P>drop's one's scissors, or anything that happens.&nbsp; Do you think



<P>Lady Russell would like that?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lady Russell could not help laughing.&nbsp; "Upon my word," said she,



<P>"I should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have



<P>admitted of such difference of conjecture, steady and matter of fact



<P>as I may call myself.&nbsp; I have really a curiosity to see the person



<P>who can give occasion to such directly opposite notions.



<P>I wish he may be induced to call here.&nbsp; And when he does, Mary,



<P>you may depend upon hearing my opinion; but I am determined



<P>not to judge him beforehand."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You will not like him, I will answer for it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lady Russell began talking of something else.&nbsp; Mary spoke with

animation



<P>of their meeting with, or rather missing, Mr Elliot so extraordinarily.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He is a man," said Lady Russell, "whom I have no wish to see.



<P>His declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his family,



<P>has left a very strong impression in his disfavour with me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This decision checked Mary's eagerness, and stopped her short



<P>in the midst of the Elliot countenance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With regard to Captain Wentworth, though Anne hazarded no enquiries,



<P>there was voluntary communication sufficient.&nbsp; His spirits had

been



<P>greatly recovering lately as might be expected.&nbsp; As Louisa improved,



<P>he had improved, and he was now quite a different creature



<P>from what he had been the first week.&nbsp; He had not seen Louisa;



<P>and was so extremely fearful of any ill consequence to her



<P>from an interview, that he did not press for it at all; and,



<P>on the contrary, seemed to have a plan of going away for a week



<P>or ten days, till her head was stronger.&nbsp; He had talked of going



<P>down to Plymouth for a week, and wanted to persuade Captain Benwick



<P>to go with him; but, as Charles maintained to the last, Captain Benwick



<P>seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both



<P>occasionally thinking of Captain Benwick, from this time.



<P>Lady Russell could not hear the door-bell without feeling that it might



<P>be his herald; nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence



<P>in her father's grounds, or any visit of charity in the village,



<P>without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him.



<P>Captain Benwick came not, however.&nbsp; He was either less disposed

for it



<P>than Charles had imagined, or he was too shy; and after giving him



<P>a week's indulgence, Lady Russell determined him to be unworthy



<P>of the interest which he had been beginning to excite.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from school,



<P>bringing with them Mrs Harville's little children, to improve the noise



<P>of Uppercross, and lessen that of Lyme.&nbsp; Henrietta remained with

Louisa;



<P>but all the rest of the family were again in their usual quarters.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once,



<P>when Anne could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive

again.



<P>Though neither Henrietta, nor Louisa, nor Charles Hayter,



<P>nor Captain Wentworth were there, the room presented as strong a contrast



<P>as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Immediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles,



<P>whom she was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children



<P>from the Cottage, expressly arrived to amuse them.&nbsp; On one side



<P>was a table occupied by some chattering girls, cutting up silk



<P>and gold paper; and on the other were tressels and trays,



<P>bending under the weight of brawn and cold pies, where riotous boys



<P>were holding high revel; the whole completed by a roaring Christmas

fire,



<P>which seemed determined to be heard, in spite of all the noise



<P>of the others.&nbsp; Charles and Mary also came in, of course,



<P>during their visit, and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects



<P>to Lady Russell, and sat down close to her for ten minutes,



<P>talking with a very raised voice, but from the clamour of the children



<P>on his knees, generally in vain.&nbsp; It was a fine family-piece.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne, judging from her own temperament, would have deemed



<P>such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves,



<P>which Louisa's illness must have so greatly shaken.&nbsp; But Mrs Musgrove,



<P>who got Anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially,



<P>again and again, for all her attentions to them, concluded



<P>a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing,



<P>with a happy glance round the room, that after all she had gone through,



<P>nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness



<P>at home.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Louisa was now recovering apace.&nbsp; Her mother could even think of

her



<P>being able to join their party at home, before her brothers and sisters



<P>went to school again.&nbsp; The Harvilles had promised to come with

her



<P>and stay at Uppercross, whenever she returned.&nbsp; Captain Wentworth

was gone,



<P>for the present, to see his brother in Shropshire.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hope I shall remember, in future," said Lady Russell, as soon as



<P>they were reseated in the carriage, "not to call at Uppercross



<P>in the Christmas holidays."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters;



<P>and sounds are quite innoxious, or most distressing, by their sort



<P>rather than their quantity.&nbsp; When Lady Russell not long afterwards,



<P>was entering Bath on a wet afternoon, and driving through



<P>the long course of streets from the Old Bridge to Camden Place,



<P>amidst the dash of other carriages, the heavy rumble of carts and drays,



<P>the bawling of newspapermen, muffin-men and milkmen, and the ceaseless



<P>clink of pattens, she made no complaint.&nbsp; No, these were noises



<P>which belonged to the winter pleasures; her spirits rose



<P>under their influence; and like Mrs Musgrove, she was feeling,



<P>though not saying, that after being long in the country, nothing could

be



<P>so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne did not share these feelings.&nbsp; She persisted in a very determined,



<P>though very silent disinclination for Bath; caught the first dim view



<P>of the extensive buildings, smoking in rain, without any wish



<P>of seeing them better; felt their progress through the streets to be,



<P>however disagreeable, yet too rapid; for who would be glad to see her



<P>when she arrived?&nbsp; And looked back, with fond regret, to the bustles



<P>of Uppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Elizabeth's last letter had communicated a piece of news of some interest.



<P>Mr Elliot was in Bath.&nbsp; He had called in Camden Place; had called



<P>a second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive.&nbsp; If Elizabeth



<P>and her father did not deceive themselves, had been taking much pains



<P>to seek the acquaintance, and proclaim the value of the connection,



<P>as he had formerly taken pains to shew neglect.&nbsp; This was very

wonderful



<P>if it were true; and Lady Russell was in a state of very agreeable



<P>curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot, already recanting the sentiment



<P>she had so lately expressed to Mary, of his being "a man whom she had



<P>no wish to see."&nbsp; She had a great wish to see him.&nbsp; If he

really sought



<P>to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch, he must be forgiven



<P>for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance,



<P>but she felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not,



<P>which was more than she could say for many other persons in Bath.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was put down in Camden Place; and Lady Russell then drove



<P>to her own lodgings, in Rivers Street.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>He was not Mr Wentworth, the former curate of Monkford,



<P>however suspicious appearances may be, but a Captain Frederick Wentworth,



<P>his brother, who being made commander in consequence of the action



<P>off St Domingo, and not immediately employed, had come into Somersetshire,



<P>in the summer of 1806; and having no parent living, found a home



<P>for half a year at Monkford.&nbsp; He was, at that time, a remarkably

fine



<P>young man, with a great deal of intelligence, spirit, and brilliancy;



<P>and Anne an extremely pretty girl, with gentleness, modesty, taste,



<P>and feeling.&nbsp; Half the sum of attraction, on either side, might

have



<P>been enough, for he had nothing to do, and she had hardly anybody to

love;



<P>but the encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail.



<P>They were gradually acquainted, and when acquainted, rapidly and



<P>deeply in love.&nbsp; It would be difficult to say which had seen



<P>highest perfection in the other, or which had been the happiest:



<P>she, in receiving his declarations and proposals, or he in



<P>having them accepted.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A short period of exquisite felicity followed, and but a short one.



<P>Troubles soon arose.&nbsp; Sir Walter, on being applied to, without

actually



<P>withholding his consent, or saying it should never be, gave it all



<P>the negative of great astonishment, great coldness, great silence,



<P>and a professed resolution of doing nothing for his daughter.



<P>He thought it a very degrading alliance; and Lady Russell, though with



<P>more tempered and pardonable pride, received it as a most unfortunate

one.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne Elliot, with all her claims of birth, beauty, and mind,



<P>to throw herself away at nineteen; involve herself at nineteen



<P>in an engagement with a young man, who had nothing but himself



<P>to recommend him, and no hopes of attaining affluence, but in the chances



<P>of a most uncertain profession, and no connexions to secure



<P>even his farther rise in the profession, would be, indeed, a throwing

away,



<P>which she grieved to think of!&nbsp; Anne Elliot, so young; known to

so few,



<P>to be snatched off by a stranger without alliance or fortune;



<P>or rather sunk by him into a state of most wearing, anxious,



<P>youth-killing dependence!&nbsp; It must not be, if by any fair interference



<P>of friendship, any representations from one who had almost a mother's

love,



<P>and mother's rights, it would be prevented.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Captain Wentworth had no fortune.&nbsp; He had been lucky in his profession;



<P>but spending freely, what had come freely, had realized nothing.



<P>But he was confident that he should soon be rich:&nbsp; full of life

and ardour,



<P>he knew that he should soon have a ship, and soon be on a station



<P>that would lead to everything he wanted.&nbsp; He had always been lucky;



<P>he knew he knew he should be so still.&nbsp; Such confidence, powerful



<P>in its own warmth, and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it,



<P>must have been enough for Anne; but Lady Russell saw it very differently.



<P>His sanguine temper, and fearlessness of mind, operated very differently



<P>on her.&nbsp; She saw in it but an aggravation of the evil.&nbsp; It

only added



<P>a dangerous character to himself.&nbsp; He was brilliant, he was headstrong.



<P>Lady Russell had little taste for wit, and of anything approaching to



<P>imprudence a horror.&nbsp; She deprecated the connexion in every light.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Such opposition, as these feelings produced, was more than



<P>Anne could combat.&nbsp; Young and gentle as she was, it might yet



<P>have been possible to withstand her father's ill-will,



<P>though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister;



<P>but Lady Russell, whom she had always loved and relied on, could not,



<P>with such steadiness of opinion, and such tenderness of manner,



<P>be continually advising her in vain.&nbsp; She was persuaded to believe



<P>the engagement a wrong thing:&nbsp; indiscreet, improper, hardly capable



<P>of success, and not deserving it.&nbsp; But it was not a merely selfish

caution,



<P>under which she acted, in putting an end to it.&nbsp; Had she not



<P>imagined herself consulting his good, even more than her own,



<P>she could hardly have given him up.&nbsp; The belief of being prudent,



<P>and self-denying, principally for his advantage, was her chief consolation,



<P>under the misery of a parting, a final parting; and every consolation



<P>was required, for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions,



<P>on his side, totally unconvinced and unbending, and of his feeling himself



<P>ill used by so forced a relinquishment.&nbsp; He had left the country



<P>in consequence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance;



<P>but not with a few months ended Anne's share of suffering from it.



<P>Her attachment and regrets had, for a long time, clouded every



<P>enjoyment of youth, and an early loss of bloom and spirits



<P>had been their lasting effect.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>More than seven years were gone since this little history



<P>of sorrowful interest had reached its close; and time had



<P>softened down much, perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him,



<P>but she had been too dependent on time alone; no aid had been given



<P>in change of place (except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture),



<P>or in any novelty or enlargement of society.&nbsp; No one had ever



<P>come within the Kellynch circle, who could bear a comparison with



<P>Frederick Wentworth, as he stood in her memory.&nbsp; No second attachment,



<P>the only thoroughly natural, happy, and sufficient cure,



<P>at her time of life, had been possible to the nice tone of her mind,



<P>the fastidiousness of her taste, in the small limits of the society



<P>around them.&nbsp; She had been solicited, when about two-and-twenty,



<P>to change her name, by the young man, who not long afterwards found



<P>a more willing mind in her younger sister; and Lady Russell had



<P>lamented her refusal; for Charles Musgrove was the eldest son of a man,



<P>whose landed property and general importance were second in that country,



<P>only to Sir Walter's, and of good character and appearance;



<P>and however Lady Russell might have asked yet for something more,



<P>while Anne was nineteen, she would have rejoiced to see her at twenty-two



<P>so respectably removed from the partialities and injustice of



<P>her father's house, and settled so permanently near herself.



<P>But in this case, Anne had left nothing for advice to do;



<P>and though Lady Russell, as satisfied as ever with her own discretion,



<P>never wished the past undone, she began now to have the anxiety



<P>which borders on hopelessness for Anne's being tempted, by some man



<P>of talents and independence, to enter a state for which she held her



<P>to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They knew not each other's opinion, either its constancy or its change,



<P>on the one leading point of Anne's conduct, for the subject was never



<P>alluded to; but Anne, at seven-and-twenty, thought very differently



<P>from what she had been made to think at nineteen.&nbsp; She did not

blame



<P>Lady Russell, she did not blame herself for having been guided by her;



<P>but she felt that were any young person, in similar circumstances,



<P>to apply to her for counsel, they would never receive any of such



<P>certain immediate wretchedness, such uncertain future good.



<P>She was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at

home,



<P>and every anxiety attending his profession, all their probable fears,



<P>delays, and disappointments, she should yet have been a happier woman



<P>in maintaining the engagement, than she had been in the sacrifice of

it;



<P>and this, she fully believed, had the usual share, had even more than



<P>the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs,



<P>without reference to the actual results of their case, which,



<P>as it happened, would have bestowed earlier prosperity than



<P>could be reasonably calculated on.&nbsp; All his sanguine expectations,



<P>all his confidence had been justified.&nbsp; His genius and ardour



<P>had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path.



<P>He had, very soon after their engagement ceased, got employ:



<P>and all that he had told her would follow, had taken place.



<P>He had distinguished himself, and early gained the other step in rank,



<P>and must now, by successive captures, have made a handsome fortune.



<P>She had only navy lists and newspapers for her authority,



<P>but she could not doubt his being rich; and, in favour of his constancy,



<P>she had no reason to believe him married.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>How eloquent could Anne Elliot have been! how eloquent, at least,



<P>were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment, and a cheerful



<P>confidence in futurity, against that over-anxious caution which



<P>seems to insult exertion and distrust Providence!&nbsp; She had been

forced



<P>into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older:



<P>the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With all these circumstances, recollections and feelings,



<P>she could not hear that Captain Wentworth's sister was likely



<P>to live at Kellynch without a revival of former pain; and many a stroll,



<P>and many a sigh, were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea.



<P>She often told herself it was folly, before she could harden her nerves



<P>sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts



<P>and their business no evil.&nbsp; She was assisted, however, by that



<P>perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness, among the only three



<P>of her own friends in the secret of the past, which seemed almost to

deny



<P>any recollection of it.&nbsp; She could do justice to the superiority



<P>of Lady Russell's motives in this, over those of her father and Elizabeth;



<P>she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness;



<P>but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important



<P>from whatever it sprung; and in the event of Admiral Croft's really



<P>taking Kellynch Hall, she rejoiced anew over the conviction which



<P>had always been most grateful to her, of the past being known to



<P>those three only among her connexions, by whom no syllable,



<P>she believed, would ever be whispered, and in the trust that among his,



<P>the brother only with whom he had been residing, had received



<P>any information of their short-lived engagement.&nbsp; That brother

had been



<P>long removed from the country and being a sensible man, and, moreover,



<P>a single man at the time, she had a fond dependence on no human creature's



<P>having heard of it from him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The sister, Mrs Croft, had then been out of England, accompanying



<P>her husband on a foreign station, and her own sister, Mary,



<P>had been at school while it all occurred; and never admitted by



<P>the pride of some, and the delicacy of others, to the smallest knowledge



<P>of it afterwards.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With these supports, she hoped that the acquaintance between herself



<P>and the Crofts, which, with Lady Russell, still resident in Kellynch,



<P>and Mary fixed only three miles off, must be anticipated,



<P>need not involve any particular awkwardness.

<P>Other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur.



<P>Anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough



<P>to have an opinion, though too wise to acknowledge as much at home,



<P>where she knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife;



<P>for while she considered Louisa to be rather the favourite,



<P>she could not but think, as far as she might dare to judge from memory



<P>and experience, that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either.



<P>They were more in love with him; yet there it was not love.



<P>It was a little fever of admiration; but it might, probably must,



<P>end in love with some.&nbsp; Charles Hayter seemed aware of being slighted,



<P>and yet Henrietta had sometimes the air of being divided between them.



<P>Anne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were

about,



<P>and of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves

to.



<P>She did not attribute guile to any.&nbsp; It was the highest satisfaction



<P>to her to believe Captain Wentworth not in the least aware



<P>of the pain he was occasioning.&nbsp; There was no triumph, no pitiful

triumph



<P>in his manner.&nbsp; He had, probably, never heard, and never thought

of



<P>any claims of Charles Hayter.&nbsp; He was only wrong in accepting



<P>the attentions (for accepting must be the word) of two young women at

once.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a short struggle, however, Charles Hayter seemed to quit the field.



<P>Three days had passed without his coming once to Uppercross;



<P>a most decided change.&nbsp; He had even refused one regular invitation

to dinner;



<P>and having been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with some large

books



<P>before him, Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not be right,



<P>and talked, with grave faces, of his studying himself to death.



<P>It was Mary's hope and belief that he had received a positive dismissal



<P>from Henrietta, and her husband lived under the constant dependence



<P>of seeing him to-morrow.&nbsp; Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter



<P>was wise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One morning, about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth



<P>being gone a-shooting together, as the sisters in the Cottage



<P>were sitting quietly at work, they were visited at the window



<P>by the sisters from the Mansion-house.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was a very fine November day, and the Miss Musgroves came



<P>through the little grounds, and stopped for no other purpose than to

say,



<P>that they were going to take a long walk, and therefore concluded



<P>Mary could not like to go with them; and when Mary immediately replied,



<P>with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker, "Oh, yes,



<P>I should like to join you very much, I am very fond of a long walk;"



<P>Anne felt persuaded, by the looks of the two girls, that it was precisely



<P>what they did not wish, and admired again the sort of necessity



<P>which the family habits seemed to produce, of everything being



<P>to be communicated, and everything being to be done together,



<P>however undesired and inconvenient.&nbsp; She tried to dissuade Mary

from going,



<P>but in vain; and that being the case, thought it best to accept



<P>the Miss Musgroves' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise,



<P>as she might be useful in turning back with her sister, and lessening



<P>the interference in any plan of their own.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I cannot imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long walk,"



<P>said Mary, as she went up stairs.&nbsp; "Everybody is always supposing



<P>that I am not a good walker; and yet they would not have been pleased,



<P>if we had refused to join them.&nbsp; When people come in this manner



<P>on purpose to ask us, how can one say no?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Just as they were setting off, the gentlemen returned.&nbsp; They had

taken out



<P>a young dog, who had spoilt their sport, and sent them back early.



<P>Their time and strength, and spirits, were, therefore, exactly ready



<P>for this walk, and they entered into it with pleasure.&nbsp; Could Anne



<P>have foreseen such a junction, she would have staid at home; but,



<P>from some feelings of interest and curiosity, she fancied now that it

was



<P>too late to retract, and the whole six set forward together



<P>in the direction chosen by the Miss Musgroves, who evidently



<P>considered the walk as under their guidance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne's object was, not to be in the way of anybody; and where



<P>the narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary,



<P>to keep with her brother and sister.&nbsp; Her pleasure in the walk



<P>must arise from the exercise and the day, from the view of



<P>the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges,



<P>and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical



<P>descriptions extant of autumn, that season of peculiar and



<P>inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness,



<P>that season which had drawn from every poet, worthy of being read,



<P>some attempt at description, or some lines of feeling.



<P>She occupied her mind as much as possible in such like musings



<P>and quotations; but it was not possible, that when within reach



<P>of Captain Wentworth's conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves,



<P>she should not try to hear it; yet she caught little very remarkable.



<P>It was mere lively chat, such as any young persons, on an intimate footing,



<P>might fall into.&nbsp; He was more engaged with Louisa than with Henrietta.



<P>Louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister.



<P>This distinction appeared to increase, and there was one speech



<P>of Louisa's which struck her.&nbsp; After one of the many praises of

the day,



<P>which were continually bursting forth, Captain Wentworth added: --

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister!&nbsp; They meant

to take



<P>a long drive this morning; perhaps we may hail them from



<P>some of these hills.&nbsp; They talked of coming into this side of the

country.



<P>I wonder whereabouts they will upset to-day.&nbsp; Oh! it does happen



<P>very often, I assure you; but my sister makes nothing of it;



<P>she would as lieve be tossed out as not."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! You make the most of it, I know," cried Louisa, "but if it were



<P>really so, I should do just the same in her place.&nbsp; If I loved

a man,



<P>as she loves the Admiral, I would always be with him, nothing should

ever



<P>separate us, and I would rather be overturned by him, than driven safely



<P>by anybody else."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was spoken with enthusiasm.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Had you?" cried he, catching the same tone; "I honour you!"



<P>And there was silence between them for a little while.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again.&nbsp; The sweet

scenes



<P>of autumn were for a while put by, unless some tender sonnet,



<P>fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year, with declining



<P>happiness, and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gone together,



<P>blessed her memory.&nbsp; She roused herself to say, as they struck

by order



<P>into another path, "Is not this one of the ways to Winthrop?"



<P>But nobody heard, or, at least, nobody answered her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Winthrop, however, or its environs--for young men are, sometimes



<P>to be met with, strolling about near home--was their destination;



<P>and after another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures,



<P>where the ploughs at work, and the fresh made path spoke the farmer



<P>counteracting the sweets of poetical despondence, and meaning



<P>to have spring again, they gained the summit of the most considerable

hill,



<P>which parted Uppercross and Winthrop, and soon commanded a full view



<P>of the latter, at the foot of the hill on the other side.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Winthrop, without beauty and without dignity, was stretched before them



<P>an indifferent house, standing low, and hemmed in by the barns and



<P>buildings of a farm-yard.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mary exclaimed, "Bless me! here is Winthrop.&nbsp; I declare I had no

idea!



<P>Well now, I think we had better turn back; I am excessively tired."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Henrietta, conscious and ashamed, and seeing no cousin Charles



<P>walking along any path, or leaning against any gate, was ready



<P>to do as Mary wished; but "No!" said Charles Musgrove, and "No, no!"



<P>cried Louisa more eagerly, and taking her sister aside, seemed to be



<P>arguing the matter warmly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Charles, in the meanwhile, was very decidedly declaring his resolution



<P>of calling on his aunt, now that he was so near; and very evidently,



<P>though more fearfully, trying to induce his wife to go too.



<P>But this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength;



<P>and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter



<P>of an hour at Winthrop, as she felt so tired, she resolutely answered,



<P>"Oh! no, indeed! walking up that hill again would do her more harm



<P>than any sitting down could do her good;" and, in short,



<P>her look and manner declared, that go she would not.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations,



<P>it was settled between Charles and his two sisters, that he



<P>and Henrietta should just run down for a few minutes, to see their aunt



<P>and cousins, while the rest of the party waited for them at the top



<P>of the hill.&nbsp; Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan;



<P>and, as she went a little way with them, down the hill, still talking



<P>to Henrietta, Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around

her,



<P>and saying to Captain Wentworth--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is very unpleasant, having such connexions!&nbsp; But, I assure

you,



<P>I have never been in the house above twice in my life."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She received no other answer, than an artificial, assenting smile,



<P>followed by a contemptuous glance, as he turned away, which Anne



<P>perfectly knew the meaning of.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The brow of the hill, where they remained, was a cheerful spot:



<P>Louisa returned; and Mary, finding a comfortable seat for herself



<P>on the step of a stile, was very well satisfied so long as the others



<P>all stood about her; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away,



<P>to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row,



<P>and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound,



<P>Mary was happy no longer; she quarrelled with her own seat,



<P>was sure Louisa had got a much better somewhere, and nothing could



<P>prevent her from going to look for a better also.&nbsp; She turned through



<P>the same gate, but could not see them.&nbsp; Anne found a nice seat



<P>for her, on a dry sunny bank, under the hedge-row, in which



<P>she had no doubt of their still being, in some spot or other.



<P>Mary sat down for a moment, but it would not do; she was sure Louisa



<P>had found a better seat somewhere else, and she would go on



<P>till she overtook her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne, really tired herself, was glad to sit down; and she very soon

heard



<P>Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge-row, behind her, as if



<P>making their way back along the rough, wild sort of channel, down the



<P>centre.&nbsp; They were speaking as they drew near.&nbsp; Louisa's voice

was



<P>the first distinguished.&nbsp; She seemed to be in the middle of some



<P>eager speech.&nbsp; What Anne first heard was--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And so, I made her go.&nbsp; I could not bear that she should be frightened



<P>from the visit by such nonsense.&nbsp; What! would I be turned back

from



<P>doing a thing that I had determined to do, and that I knew to be right,



<P>by the airs and interference of such a person, or of any person I may

say?



<P>No, I have no idea of being so easily persuaded.&nbsp; When I have



<P>made up my mind, I have made it; and Henrietta seemed entirely



<P>to have made up hers to call at Winthrop to-day; and yet, she was as

near



<P>giving it up, out of nonsensical complaisance!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She would have turned back then, but for you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She would indeed.&nbsp; I am almost ashamed to say it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Happy for her, to have such a mind as yours at hand!&nbsp; After the

hints



<P>you gave just now, which did but confirm my own observations,



<P>the last time I was in company with him,&nbsp; I need not affect



<P>to have no comprehension of what is going on.&nbsp; I see that more

than



<P>a mere dutiful morning visit to your aunt was in question;



<P>and woe betide him, and her too, when it comes to things of consequence,



<P>when they are placed in circumstances requiring fortitude and



<P>strength of mind, if she have not resolution enough to resist



<P>idle interference in such a trifle as this.&nbsp; Your sister is



<P>an amiable creature; but yours is the character of decision and firmness,



<P>I see.&nbsp; If you value her conduct or happiness, infuse as much



<P>of your own spirit into her as you can.&nbsp; But this, no doubt,



<P>you have been always doing.&nbsp; It is the worst evil of too yielding



<P>and indecisive a character, that no influence over it can be depended

on.



<P>You are never sure of a good impression being durable; everybody



<P>may sway it.&nbsp; Let those who would be happy be firm.&nbsp; Here

is a nut,"



<P>said he, catching one down from an upper bough.&nbsp; "to exemplify:



<P>a beautiful glossy nut, which, blessed with original strength,



<P>has outlived all the storms of autumn.&nbsp; Not a puncture, not



<P>a weak spot anywhere.&nbsp; This nut," he continued, with playful solemnity,



<P>"while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot,



<P>is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be



<P>supposed capable of."&nbsp; Then returning to his former earnest tone--



<P>"My first wish for all whom I am interested in, is that they should

be firm.



<P>If Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life,



<P>she will cherish all her present powers of mind."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had done, and was unanswered.&nbsp; It would have surprised Anne

if Louisa



<P>could have readily answered such a speech:&nbsp; words of such interest,



<P>spoken with such serious warmth!&nbsp; She could imagine what Louisa

was feeling.



<P>For herself, she feared to move, lest she should be seen.



<P>While she remained, a bush of low rambling holly protected her,



<P>and they were moving on.&nbsp; Before they were beyond her hearing,



<P>however, Louisa spoke again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mary is good-natured enough in many respects," said she;



<P>"but she does sometimes provoke me excessively, by her nonsense



<P>and pride-- the Elliot pride.&nbsp; She has a great deal too much



<P>of the Elliot pride.&nbsp; We do so wish that Charles had married Anne

instead.



<P>I suppose you know he wanted to marry Anne?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a moment's pause, Captain Wentworth said--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you mean that she refused him?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! yes; certainly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"When did that happen?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not exactly know, for Henrietta and I were at school at the time;



<P>but I believe about a year before he married Mary.&nbsp; I wish she

had



<P>accepted him.&nbsp; We should all have liked her a great deal better;



<P>and papa and mamma always think it was her great friend



<P>Lady Russell's doing, that she did not.&nbsp; They think Charles



<P>might not be learned and bookish enough to please Lady Russell,



<P>and that therefore, she persuaded Anne to refuse him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The sounds were retreating, and Anne distinguished no more.



<P>Her own emotions still kept her fixed.&nbsp; She had much to recover

from,



<P>before she could move.&nbsp; The listener's proverbial fate was



<P>not absolutely hers; she had heard no evil of herself, but she had heard



<P>a great deal of very painful import.&nbsp; She saw how her own character



<P>was considered by Captain Wentworth, and there had been just that degree



<P>of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her



<P>extreme agitation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As soon as she could, she went after Mary, and having found,



<P>and walked back with her to their former station, by the stile,



<P>felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards



<P>collected, and once more in motion together.&nbsp; Her spirits wanted



<P>the solitude and silence which only numbers could give.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Charles and Henrietta returned, bringing, as may be conjectured,



<P>Charles Hayter with them.&nbsp; The minutiae of the business Anne



<P>could not attempt to understand; even Captain Wentworth did not seem



<P>admitted to perfect confidence here; but that there had been a withdrawing



<P>on the gentleman's side, and a relenting on the lady's, and that they



<P>were now very glad to be together again, did not admit a doubt.



<P>Henrietta looked a little ashamed, but very well pleased;--



<P>Charles Hayter exceedingly happy:&nbsp; and they were devoted to each

other



<P>almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth;



<P>nothing could be plainer; and where many divisions were necessary,



<P>or even where they were not, they walked side by side nearly as much



<P>as the other two.&nbsp; In a long strip of meadow land, where there

was



<P>ample space for all, they were thus divided, forming three distinct

parties;



<P>and to that party of the three which boasted least animation,



<P>and least complaisance, Anne necessarily belonged.&nbsp; She joined

Charles



<P>and Mary, and was tired enough to be very glad of Charles's other arm;



<P>but Charles, though in very good humour with her, was out of temper



<P>with his wife.&nbsp; Mary had shewn herself disobliging to him,



<P>and was now to reap the consequence, which consequence was



<P>his dropping her arm almost every moment to cut off the heads



<P>of some nettles in the hedge with his switch; and when Mary began



<P>to complain of it, and lament her being ill-used, according to custom,



<P>in being on the hedge side, while Anne was never incommoded on the other,



<P>he dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which he had



<P>a momentary glance of, and they could hardly get him along at all.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This long meadow bordered a lane, which their footpath, at the end of

it



<P>was to cross, and when the party had all reached the gate of exit,



<P>the carriage advancing in the same direction, which had been



<P>some time heard, was just coming up, and proved to be Admiral Croft's

gig.



<P>He and his wife had taken their intended drive, and were returning home.



<P>Upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in,



<P>they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired;



<P>it would save her a full mile, and they were going through Uppercross.



<P>The invitation was general, and generally declined.&nbsp; The Miss Musgroves



<P>were not at all tired, and Mary was either offended, by not being asked



<P>before any of the others, or what Louisa called the Elliot pride



<P>could not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The walking party had crossed the lane, and were surmounting an



<P>opposite stile, and the Admiral was putting his horse in motion again,



<P>when Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something



<P>to his sister.&nbsp; The something might be guessed by its effects.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Miss Elliot, I am sure you are tired," cried Mrs Croft.



<P>"Do let us have the pleasure of taking you home.&nbsp; Here is excellent

room



<P>for three, I assure you.&nbsp; If we were all like you, I believe we

might



<P>sit four.&nbsp; You must, indeed, you must."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne was still in the lane; and though instinctively beginning to decline,



<P>she was not allowed to proceed.&nbsp; The Admiral's kind urgency



<P>came in support of his wife's; they would not be refused;



<P>they compressed themselves into the smallest possible space



<P>to leave her a corner, and Captain Wentworth, without saying a word,



<P>turned to her, and quietly obliged her to be assisted into the carriage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Yes; he had done it.&nbsp; She was in the carriage, and felt that he

had



<P>placed her there, that his will and his hands had done it,



<P>that she owed it to his perception of her fatigue, and his resolution



<P>to give her rest.&nbsp; She was very much affected by the view of



<P>his disposition towards her, which all these things made apparent.



<P>This little circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone

before.



<P>She understood him.&nbsp; He could not forgive her, but he could not



<P>be unfeeling.&nbsp; Though condemning her for the past, and considering

it



<P>with high and unjust resentment, though perfectly careless of her,



<P>and though becoming attached to another, still he could not see her

suffer,



<P>without the desire of giving her relief.&nbsp; It was a remainder



<P>of former sentiment; it was an impulse of pure, though unacknowledged



<P>friendship; it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart,



<P>which she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded



<P>of pleasure and pain, that she knew not which prevailed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions



<P>were at first unconsciously given.&nbsp; They had travelled half their

way



<P>along the rough lane, before she was quite awake to what they said.



<P>She then found them talking of "Frederick."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He certainly means to have one or other of those two girls, Sophy,"



<P>said the Admiral; "but there is no saying which.&nbsp; He has been



<P>running after them, too, long enough, one would think, to make up his

mind.



<P>Ay, this comes of the peace.&nbsp; If it were war now, he would have



<P>settled it long ago.&nbsp; We sailors, Miss Elliot, cannot afford to

make



<P>long courtships in time of war.&nbsp; How many days was it, my dear,



<P>between the first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together



<P>in our lodgings at North Yarmouth?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We had better not talk about it, my dear," replied Mrs Croft, pleasantly;



<P>"for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an understanding,



<P>she would never be persuaded that we could be happy together.



<P>I had known you by character, however, long before."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl, and what were we



<P>to wait for besides?&nbsp; I do not like having such things so long

in hand.



<P>I wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass, and bring us home



<P>one of these young ladies to Kellynch.&nbsp; Then there would always



<P>be company for them.&nbsp; And very nice young ladies they both are;



<P>I hardly know one from the other."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very good humoured, unaffected girls, indeed," said Mrs Croft,



<P>in a tone of calmer praise, such as made Anne suspect that



<P>her keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy



<P>of her brother; "and a very respectable family.&nbsp; One could not

be



<P>connected with better people.&nbsp; My dear Admiral, that post!



<P>we shall certainly take that post."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily



<P>passed the danger; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out



<P>her hand they neither fell into a rut, nor ran foul of a dung-cart;



<P>and Anne, with some amusement at their style of driving,



<P>which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance



<P>of their affairs, found herself safely deposited by them at the Cottage.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>The time now approached for Lady Russell's return:&nbsp; the day was

even fixed;



<P>and Anne, being engaged to join her as soon as she was resettled,



<P>was looking forward to an early removal to Kellynch, and beginning



<P>to think how her own comfort was likely to be affected by it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth,



<P>within half a mile of him; they would have to frequent the same church,



<P>and there must be intercourse between the two families.



<P>This was against her; but on the other hand, he spent so much of his

time



<P>at Uppercross, that in removing thence she might be considered rather



<P>as leaving him behind, than as going towards him; and, upon the whole,



<P>she believed she must, on this interesting question, be the gainer,



<P>almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society,



<P>in leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing



<P>Captain Wentworth at the Hall:&nbsp; those rooms had witnessed



<P>former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her;



<P>but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of Lady Russell and



<P>Captain Wentworth never meeting anywhere.&nbsp; They did not like each

other,



<P>and no renewal of acquaintance now could do any good; and were Lady

Russell



<P>to see them together, she might think that he had too much self-possession,



<P>and she too little.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These points formed her chief solicitude in anticipating



<P>her removal from Uppercross, where she felt she had been stationed



<P>quite long enough.&nbsp; Her usefulness to little Charles would always



<P>give some sweetness to the memory of her two months' visit there,



<P>but he was gaining strength apace, and she had nothing else to stay

for.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The conclusion of her visit, however, was diversified in a way



<P>which she had not at all imagined.&nbsp; Captain Wentworth, after being

unseen



<P>and unheard of at Uppercross for two whole days, appeared again among

them



<P>to justify himself by a relation of what had kept him away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A letter from his friend, Captain Harville, having found him out at

last,



<P>had brought intelligence of Captain Harville's being settled



<P>with his family at Lyme for the winter; of their being therefore,



<P>quite unknowingly, within twenty miles of each other.&nbsp; Captain

Harville



<P>had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received



<P>two years before, and Captain Wentworth's anxiety to see him



<P>had determined him to go immediately to Lyme.&nbsp; He had been there



<P>for four-and-twenty hours.&nbsp; His acquittal was complete,



<P>his friendship warmly honoured, a lively interest excited for his friend,



<P>and his description of the fine country about Lyme so feelingly attended

to



<P>by the party, that an earnest desire to see Lyme themselves,



<P>and a project for going thither was the consequence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The young people were all wild to see Lyme.&nbsp; Captain Wentworth

talked



<P>of going there again himself, it was only seventeen miles from Uppercross;



<P>though November, the weather was by no means bad; and, in short,



<P>Louisa, who was the most eager of the eager, having formed



<P>the resolution to go, and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked,



<P>being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way,



<P>bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off



<P>till summer; and to Lyme they were to go--Charles, Mary, Anne, Henrietta,



<P>Louisa, and Captain Wentworth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The first heedless scheme had been to go in the morning and return at

night;



<P>but to this Mr Musgrove, for the sake of his horses, would not consent;



<P>and when it came to be rationally considered, a day in



<P>the middle of November would not leave much time for seeing a new place,



<P>after deducting seven hours, as the nature of the country required,



<P>for going and returning.&nbsp; They were, consequently, to stay the

night there,



<P>and not to be expected back till the next day's dinner.&nbsp; This was

felt



<P>to be a considerable amendment; and though they all met at the Great

House



<P>at rather an early breakfast hour, and set off very punctually,



<P>it was so much past noon before the two carriages, Mr Musgrove's coach



<P>containing the four ladies, and Charles's curricle, in which



<P>he drove Captain Wentworth, were descending the long hill into Lyme,



<P>and entering upon the still steeper street of the town itself,



<P>that it was very evident they would not have more than time



<P>for looking about them, before the light and warmth of the day were

gone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After securing accommodations, and ordering a dinner at one of the inns,



<P>the next thing to be done was unquestionably to walk directly



<P>down to the sea.&nbsp; They were come too late in the year for any amusement



<P>or variety which Lyme, as a public place, might offer.&nbsp; The rooms



<P>were shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family



<P>but of the residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire



<P>in the buildings themselves, the remarkable situation of the town,



<P>the principal street almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the

Cobb,



<P>skirting round the pleasant little bay, which, in the season,



<P>is animated with bathing machines and company; the Cobb itself,



<P>its old wonders and new improvements, with the very beautiful



<P>line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town, are what



<P>the stranger's eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be,



<P>who does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme,



<P>to make him wish to know it better.&nbsp; The scenes in its neighbourhood,



<P>Charmouth, with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country,



<P>and still more, its sweet, retired bay, backed by dark cliffs,



<P>where fragments of low rock among the sands, make it the happiest spot



<P>for watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in unwearied contemplation;



<P>the woody varieties of the cheerful village of Up Lyme; and, above all,



<P>Pinny, with its green chasms between romantic rocks, where



<P>the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth,



<P>declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first



<P>partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state,



<P>where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited, as may



<P>more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed



<P>Isle of Wight:&nbsp; these places must be visited, and visited again,



<P>to make the worth of Lyme understood.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The party from Uppercross passing down by the now deserted



<P>and melancholy looking rooms, and still descending, soon found themselves



<P>on the sea-shore; and lingering only, as all must linger and gaze



<P>on a first return to the sea, who ever deserved to look on it at all,



<P>proceeded towards the Cobb, equally their object in itself



<P>and on Captain Wentworth's account:&nbsp; for in a small house,



<P>near the foot of an old pier of unknown date, were the Harvilles settled.



<P>Captain Wentworth turned in to call on his friend; the others walked

on,



<P>and he was to join them on the Cobb.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They were by no means tired of wondering and admiring; and not even

Louisa



<P>seemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long,



<P>when they saw him coming after them, with three companions,



<P>all well known already, by description, to be Captain and Mrs Harville,



<P>and a Captain Benwick, who was staying with them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Captain Benwick had some time ago been first lieutenant of the Laconia;



<P>and the account which Captain Wentworth had given of him,



<P>on his return from Lyme before, his warm praise of him as



<P>an excellent young man and an officer, whom he had always valued highly,



<P>which must have stamped him well in the esteem of every listener,



<P>had been followed by a little history of his private life,



<P>which rendered him perfectly interesting in the eyes of all the ladies.



<P>He had been engaged to Captain Harville's sister, and was now



<P>mourning her loss.&nbsp; They had been a year or two waiting for fortune



<P>and promotion.&nbsp; Fortune came, his prize-money as lieutenant being

great;



<P>promotion, too, came at last; but Fanny Harville did not live to know

it.



<P>She had died the preceding summer while he was at sea.&nbsp; Captain

Wentworth



<P>believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman



<P>than poor Benwick had been to Fanny Harville, or to be more deeply



<P>afflicted under the dreadful change.&nbsp; He considered his disposition



<P>as of the sort which must suffer heavily, uniting very strong feelings



<P>with quiet, serious, and retiring manners, and a decided taste for reading,



<P>and sedentary pursuits.&nbsp; To finish the interest of the story,



<P>the friendship between him and the Harvilles seemed, if possible,



<P>augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance,



<P>and Captain Benwick was now living with them entirely.&nbsp; Captain

Harville



<P>had taken his present house for half a year; his taste, and his health,



<P>and his fortune, all directing him to a residence inexpensive,



<P>and by the sea; and the grandeur of the country, and the retirement



<P>of Lyme in the winter, appeared exactly adapted to Captain Benwick's



<P>state of mind.&nbsp; The sympathy and good-will excited towards Captain

Benwick



<P>was very great.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And yet," said Anne to herself, as they now moved forward



<P>to meet the party, "he has not, perhaps, a more sorrowing heart



<P>than I have.&nbsp; I cannot believe his prospects so blighted for ever.



<P>He is younger than I am; younger in feeling, if not in fact;



<P>younger as a man.&nbsp; He will rally again, and be happy with another."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They all met, and were introduced.&nbsp; Captain Harville was a tall,



<P>dark man, with a sensible, benevolent countenance; a little lame;



<P>and from strong features and want of health, looking much older



<P>than Captain Wentworth.&nbsp; Captain Benwick looked, and was,



<P>the youngest of the three, and, compared with either of them,



<P>a little man.&nbsp; He had a pleasing face and a melancholy air,



<P>just as he ought to have, and drew back from conversation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Captain Harville, though not equalling Captain Wentworth in manners,



<P>was a perfect gentleman, unaffected, warm, and obliging.



<P>Mrs Harville, a degree less polished than her husband, seemed, however,



<P>to have the same good feelings; and nothing could be more pleasant



<P>than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their

own,



<P>because the friends of Captain Wentworth, or more kindly hospitable



<P>than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them.



<P>The dinner, already ordered at the inn, was at last, though unwillingly,



<P>accepted as a excuse; but they seemed almost hurt that Captain Wentworth



<P>should have brought any such party to Lyme, without considering it



<P>as a thing of course that they should dine with them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was so much attachment to Captain Wentworth in all this,



<P>and such a bewitching charm in a degree of hospitality so uncommon,



<P>so unlike the usual style of give-and-take invitations, and dinners



<P>of formality and display, that Anne felt her spirits not likely to be



<P>benefited by an increasing acquaintance among his brother-officers.



<P>"These would have been all my friends," was her thought;



<P>and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On quitting the Cobb, they all went in-doors with their new friends,



<P>and found rooms so small as none but those who invite from the heart



<P>could think capable of accommodating so many.&nbsp; Anne had



<P>a moment's astonishment on the subject herself; but it was soon lost



<P>in the pleasanter feelings which sprang from the sight of all



<P>the ingenious contrivances and nice arrangements of Captain Harville,



<P>to turn the actual space to the best account, to supply the deficiencies



<P>of lodging-house furniture, and defend the windows and doors



<P>against the winter storms to be expected.&nbsp; The varieties in



<P>the fitting-up of the rooms, where the common necessaries



<P>provided by the owner, in the common indifferent plight,



<P>were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood,



<P>excellently worked up, and with something curious and valuable



<P>from all the distant countries Captain Harville had visited,



<P>were more than amusing to Anne; connected as it all was with his profession,



<P>the fruit of its labours, the effect of its influence on his habits,



<P>the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented,



<P>made it to her a something more, or less, than gratification.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Captain Harville was no reader; but he had contrived



<P>excellent accommodations, and fashioned very pretty shelves,



<P>for a tolerable collection of well-bound volumes, the property of



<P>Captain Benwick.&nbsp; His lameness prevented him from taking much exercise;



<P>but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with



<P>constant employment within.&nbsp; He drew, he varnished, he carpentered,



<P>he glued; he made toys for the children; he fashioned new netting-needles



<P>and pins with improvements; and if everything else was done,



<P>sat down to his large fishing-net at one corner of the room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they



<P>quitted the house; and Louisa, by whom she found herself walking,



<P>burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character



<P>of the navy; their friendliness, their brotherliness, their openness,



<P>their uprightness; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having



<P>more worth and warmth than any other set of men in England;



<P>that they only knew how to live, and they only deserved to be



<P>respected and loved.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They went back to dress and dine; and so well had the scheme



<P>answered already, that nothing was found amiss; though its being



<P>"so entirely out of season," and the "no thoroughfare of Lyme,"



<P>and the "no expectation of company," had brought many apologies



<P>from the heads of the inn.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne found herself by this time growing so much more hardened



<P>to being in Captain Wentworth's company than she had at first imagined



<P>could ever be, that the sitting down to the same table with him now,



<P>and the interchange of the common civilities attending on it



<P>(they never got beyond), was become a mere nothing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The nights were too dark for the ladies to meet again till the morrow,



<P>but Captain Harville had promised them a visit in the evening;



<P>and he came, bringing his friend also, which was more than



<P>had been expected, it having been agreed that Captain Benwick



<P>had all the appearance of being oppressed by the presence of



<P>so many strangers.&nbsp; He ventured among them again, however,



<P>though his spirits certainly did not seem fit for the mirth



<P>of the party in general.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the

room,



<P>and by recurring to former days, supplied anecdotes in abundance



<P>to occupy and entertain the others, it fell to Anne's lot to be placed



<P>rather apart with Captain Benwick; and a very good impulse



<P>of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him.



<P>He was shy, and disposed to abstraction; but the engaging mildness of



<P>her countenance, and gentleness of her manners, soon had their effect;



<P>and Anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion.



<P>He was evidently a young man of considerable taste in reading,



<P>though principally in poetry; and besides the persuasion of having



<P>given him at least an evening's indulgence in the discussion of subjects,



<P>which his usual companions had probably no concern in, she had the hope



<P>of being of real use to him in some suggestions as to the duty and



<P>benefit of struggling against affliction, which had naturally grown

out



<P>of their conversation.&nbsp; For, though shy, he did not seem reserved;



<P>it had rather the appearance of feelings glad to burst their



<P>usual restraints; and having talked of poetry, the richness of



<P>the present age, and gone through a brief comparison of opinion



<P>as to the first-rate poets, trying to ascertain whether Marmion



<P>or The Lady of the Lake were to be preferred, and how ranked the Giaour



<P>and The Bride of Abydos; and moreover, how the Giaour was to be pronounced,



<P>he showed himself so intimately acquainted with all the tenderest songs



<P>of the one poet, and all the impassioned descriptions of hopeless agony



<P>of the other; he repeated, with such tremulous feeling, the various

lines



<P>which imaged a broken heart, or a mind destroyed by wretchedness,



<P>and looked so entirely as if he meant to be understood,



<P>that she ventured to hope he did not always read only poetry,



<P>and to say, that she thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be



<P>seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely;



<P>and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly



<P>were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His looks shewing him not pained, but pleased with this allusion



<P>to his situation, she was emboldened to go on; and feeling in herself



<P>the right of seniority of mind, she ventured to recommend



<P>a larger allowance of prose in his daily study; and on being requested



<P>to particularize, mentioned such works of our best moralists,



<P>such collections of the finest letters, such memoirs of characters



<P>of worth and suffering, as occurred to her at the moment



<P>as calculated to rouse and fortify the mind by the highest precepts,



<P>and the strongest examples of moral and religious endurances.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Captain Benwick listened attentively, and seemed grateful for



<P>the interest implied; and though with a shake of the head,



<P>and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books



<P>on grief like his, noted down the names of those she recommended,



<P>and promised to procure and read them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the evening was over, Anne could not but be amused at the idea



<P>of her coming to Lyme to preach patience and resignation to a young

man



<P>whom she had never seen before; nor could she help fearing,



<P>on more serious reflection, that, like many other great moralists



<P>and preachers, she had been eloquent on a point in which her own conduct



<P>would ill bear examination.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>On the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Croft's seeing Kellynch

Hall,



<P>Anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady Russell's,



<P>and keep out of the way till all was over; when she found it most natural



<P>to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This meeting of the two parties proved highly satisfactory,



<P>and decided the whole business at once.&nbsp; Each lady was previously



<P>well disposed for an agreement, and saw nothing, therefore,



<P>but good manners in the other; and with regard to the gentlemen,



<P>there was such an hearty good humour, such an open, trusting liberality



<P>on the Admiral's side, as could not but influence Sir Walter,



<P>who had besides been flattered into his very best and most polished



<P>behaviour by Mr Shepherd's assurances of his being known, by report,



<P>to the Admiral, as a model of good breeding.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The house and grounds, and furniture, were approved, the Crofts



<P>were approved, terms, time, every thing, and every body, was right;



<P>and Mr Shepherd's clerks were set to work, without there having been



<P>a single preliminary difference to modify of all that



<P>"This indenture sheweth."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Walter, without hesitation, declared the Admiral to be



<P>the best-looking sailor he had ever met with, and went so far as to

say,



<P>that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair,



<P>he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where;



<P>and the Admiral, with sympathetic cordiality, observed to his wife



<P>as they drove back through the park, "I thought we should soon



<P>come to a deal, my dear, in spite of what they told us at Taunton.



<P>The Baronet will never set the Thames on fire, but there seems to be



<P>no harm in him."&nbsp; reciprocal compliments, which would have been



<P>esteemed about equal.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Crofts were to have possession at Michaelmas; and as Sir Walter



<P>proposed removing to Bath in the course of the preceding month,



<P>there was no time to be lost in making every dependent arrangement.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lady Russell, convinced that Anne would not be allowed to be of any

use,



<P>or any importance, in the choice of the house which they were



<P>going to secure, was very unwilling to have her hurried away so soon,



<P>and wanted to make it possible for her to stay behind till she might



<P>convey her to Bath herself after Christmas; but having engagements



<P>of her own which must take her from Kellynch for several weeks,



<P>she was unable to give the full invitation she wished, and Anne



<P>though dreading the possible heats of September in all the white glare



<P>of Bath, and grieving to forego all the influence so sweet and so sad



<P>of the autumnal months in the country, did not think that,



<P>everything considered, she wished to remain.&nbsp; It would be most

right,



<P>and most wise, and, therefore must involve least suffering



<P>to go with the others.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Something occurred, however, to give her a different duty.



<P>Mary, often a little unwell, and always thinking a great deal



<P>of her own complaints, and always in the habit of claiming Anne



<P>when anything was the matter, was indisposed; and foreseeing



<P>that she should not have a day's health all the autumn, entreated,



<P>or rather required her, for it was hardly entreaty, to come to



<P>Uppercross Cottage, and bear her company as long as she should want

her,



<P>instead of going to Bath.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I cannot possibly do without Anne," was Mary's reasoning;



<P>and Elizabeth's reply was, "Then I am sure Anne had better stay,



<P>for nobody will want her in Bath."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at least



<P>better than being rejected as no good at all; and Anne, glad to



<P>be thought of some use, glad to have anything marked out as a duty,



<P>and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country,



<P>and her own dear country, readily agreed to stay.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This invitation of Mary's removed all Lady Russell's difficulties,



<P>and it was consequently soon settled that Anne should not go to Bath



<P>till Lady Russell took her, and that all the intervening time



<P>should be divided between Uppercross Cottage and Kellynch Lodge.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So far all was perfectly right; but Lady Russell was almost startled



<P>by the wrong of one part of the Kellynch Hall plan, when it burst on

her,



<P>which was, Mrs Clay's being engaged to go to Bath with Sir Walter



<P>and Elizabeth, as a most important and valuable assistant to the latter



<P>in all the business before her.&nbsp; Lady Russell was extremely sorry



<P>that such a measure should have been resorted to at all, wondered,



<P>grieved, and feared; and the affront it contained to Anne,



<P>in Mrs Clay's being of so much use, while Anne could be of none,



<P>was a very sore aggravation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne herself was become hardened to such affronts; but she felt



<P>the imprudence of the arrangement quite as keenly as Lady Russell.



<P>With a great deal of quiet observation, and a knowledge,



<P>which she often wished less, of her father's character, she was



<P>sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy



<P>were more than possible.&nbsp; She did not imagine that her father



<P>had at present an idea of the kind.&nbsp; Mrs Clay had freckles,



<P>and a projecting tooth, and a clumsy wrist, which he was continually



<P>making severe remarks upon, in her absence; but she was young,



<P>and certainly altogether well-looking, and possessed, in an acute mind



<P>and assiduous pleasing manners, infinitely more dangerous attractions



<P>than any merely personal might have been.&nbsp; Anne was so impressed



<P>by the degree of their danger, that she could not excuse herself



<P>from trying to make it perceptible to her sister.&nbsp; She had little

hope



<P>of success; but Elizabeth, who in the event of such a reverse would

be



<P>so much more to be pitied than herself, should never, she thought,



<P>have reason to reproach her for giving no warning.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She spoke, and seemed only to offend.&nbsp; Elizabeth could not conceive



<P>how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her, and indignantly



<P>answered for each party's perfectly knowing their situation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mrs Clay," said she, warmly, "never forgets who she is;



<P>and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can

be,



<P>I can assure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are



<P>particularly nice, and that she reprobates all inequality of condition



<P>and rank more strongly than most people.&nbsp; And as to my father,



<P>I really should not have thought that he, who has kept himself single



<P>so long for our sakes, need be suspected now.&nbsp; If Mrs Clay were



<P>a very beautiful woman, I grant you, it might be wrong to have her



<P>so much with me; not that anything in the world, I am sure,



<P>would induce my father to make a degrading match, but he might



<P>be rendered unhappy.&nbsp; But poor Mrs Clay who, with all her merits,



<P>can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty, I really think poor



<P>Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety.&nbsp; One would imagine



<P>you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes,



<P>though I know you must fifty times.&nbsp; That tooth of her's



<P>and those freckles.&nbsp; Freckles do not disgust me so very much



<P>as they do him.&nbsp; I have known a face not materially disfigured

by a few,



<P>but he abominates them.&nbsp; You must have heard him notice



<P>Mrs Clay's freckles."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is hardly any personal defect," replied Anne,



<P>"which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think very differently," answered Elizabeth, shortly;



<P>"an agreeable manner may set off handsome features, but can never



<P>alter plain ones.&nbsp; However, at any rate, as I have a great deal

more



<P>at stake on this point than anybody else can have, I think it



<P>rather unnecessary in you to be advising me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne had done; glad that it was over, and not absolutely hopeless



<P>of doing good.&nbsp; Elizabeth, though resenting the suspicion,



<P>might yet be made observant by it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The last office of the four carriage-horses was to draw Sir Walter,



<P>Miss Elliot, and Mrs Clay to Bath.&nbsp; The party drove off



<P>in very good spirits;&nbsp; Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows



<P>for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint



<P>to show themselves, and Anne walked up at the same time,



<P>in a sort of desolate tranquility, to the Lodge, where she was to spend



<P>the first week.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her friend was not in better spirits than herself. Lady Russell felt

this



<P>break-up of the family exceedingly.&nbsp; Their respectability was



<P>as dear to her as her own, and a daily intercourse had become



<P>precious by habit.&nbsp; It was painful to look upon their deserted

grounds,



<P>and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into;



<P>and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village,



<P>and be out of the way when Admiral and Mrs Croft first arrived,



<P>she had determined to make her own absence from home begin



<P>when she must give up Anne.&nbsp; Accordingly their removal was made

together,



<P>and Anne was set down at Uppercross Cottage, in the first stage



<P>of Lady Russell's journey.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Uppercross was a moderate-sized village, which a few years back



<P>had been completely in the old English style, containing only



<P>two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers;



<P>the mansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old

trees,



<P>substantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage,



<P>enclosed in its own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree



<P>trained round its casements; but upon the marriage of the young 'squire,



<P>it had received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage,



<P>for his residence, and Uppercross Cottage, with its veranda,



<P>French windows, and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch



<P>the traveller's eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect



<P>and premises of the Great House, about a quarter of a mile farther on.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here Anne had often been staying.&nbsp; She knew the ways of Uppercross



<P>as well as those of Kellynch.&nbsp; The two families were so continually

meeting,



<P>so much in the habit of running in and out of each other's house



<P>at all hours, that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary alone;



<P>but being alone, her being unwell and out of spirits was almost



<P>a matter of course.&nbsp; Though better endowed than the elder sister,



<P>Mary had not Anne's understanding nor temper.&nbsp; While well, and

happy,



<P>and properly attended to, she had great good humour and excellent spirits;



<P>but any indisposition sunk her completely.&nbsp; She had no resources



<P>for solitude; and inheriting a considerable share of the Elliot



<P>self-importance, was very prone to add to every other distress



<P>that of fancying herself neglected and ill-used.&nbsp; In person, she

was



<P>inferior to both sisters, and had, even in her bloom, only reached



<P>the dignity of being "a fine girl."&nbsp; She was now lying on the faded

sofa



<P>of the pretty little drawing-room, the once elegant furniture of which



<P>had been gradually growing shabby, under the influence of four summers



<P>and two children; and, on Anne's appearing, greeted her with--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So, you are come at last!&nbsp; I began to think I should never see

you.



<P>I am so ill I can hardly speak.&nbsp; I have not seen a creature



<P>the whole morning!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am sorry to find you unwell," replied Anne.&nbsp; "You sent me



<P>such a good account of yourself on Thursday!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, I made the best of it; I always do:&nbsp; but I was very far from

well



<P>at the time; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life



<P>as I have been all this morning:&nbsp; very unfit to be left alone,

I am sure.



<P>Suppose I were to be seized of a sudden in some dreadful way,



<P>and not able to ring the bell!&nbsp; So, Lady Russell would not get

out.



<P>I do not think she has been in this house three times this summer."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne said what was proper, and enquired after her husband.



<P>"Oh! Charles is out shooting.&nbsp; I have not seen him since seven

o'clock.



<P>He would go, though I told him how ill I was.&nbsp; He said he should

not



<P>stay out long; but he has never come back, and now it is almost one.



<P>I assure you, I have not seen a soul this whole long morning."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You have had your little boys with you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, as long as I could bear their noise; but they are so unmanageable



<P>that they do me more harm than good.&nbsp; Little Charles does not mind



<P>a word I say, and Walter is growing quite as bad."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, you will soon be better now," replied Anne, cheerfully.



<P>"You know I always cure you when I come.&nbsp; How are your neighbours



<P>at the Great House?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I can give you no account of them.&nbsp; I have not seen one of them

to-day,



<P>except Mr Musgrove, who just stopped and spoke through the window,



<P>but without getting off his horse; and though I told him how ill I was,



<P>not one of them have been near me.&nbsp; It did not happen to suit



<P>the Miss Musgroves, I suppose, and they never put themselves



<P>out of their way."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You will see them yet, perhaps, before the morning is gone.



<P>It is early."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I never want them, I assure you.&nbsp; They talk and laugh a great

deal



<P>too much for me.&nbsp; Oh! Anne, I am so very unwell!&nbsp; It was quite

unkind



<P>of you not to come on Thursday."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Mary, recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself!



<P>You wrote in the cheerfullest manner, and said you were perfectly well,



<P>and in no hurry for me; and that being the case, you must be aware



<P>that my wish would be to remain with Lady Russell to the last:



<P>and besides what I felt on her account, I have really been so busy,



<P>have had so much to do, that I could not very conveniently have



<P>left Kellynch sooner."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dear me! what can you possibly have to do?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A great many things, I assure you.&nbsp; More than I can recollect



<P>in a moment; but I can tell you some.&nbsp; I have been making



<P>a duplicate of the catalogue of my father's books and pictures.



<P>I have been several times in the garden with Mackenzie,



<P>trying to understand, and make him understand, which of Elizabeth's

plants



<P>are for Lady Russell.&nbsp; I have had all my own little concerns



<P>to arrange, books and music to divide, and all my trunks to repack,



<P>from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons:



<P>and one thing I have had to do, Mary, of a more trying nature:



<P>going to almost every house in the parish, as a sort of take-leave.



<P>I was told that they wished it.&nbsp; But all these things took up



<P>a great deal of time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! well!" and after a moment's pause, "but you have never asked me



<P>one word about our dinner at the Pooles yesterday."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Did you go then?&nbsp; I have made no enquiries, because I concluded



<P>you must have been obliged to give up the party."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh yes! I went.&nbsp; I was very well yesterday; nothing at all



<P>the matter with me till this morning.&nbsp; It would have been strange



<P>if I had not gone."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am very glad you were well enough, and I hope you had a pleasant

party."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nothing remarkable.&nbsp; One always knows beforehand what the dinner

will be,



<P>and who will be there; and it is so very uncomfortable not having



<P>a carriage of one's own.&nbsp; Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me, and we were



<P>so crowded!&nbsp; They are both so very large, and take up so much room;



<P>and Mr Musgrove always sits forward.&nbsp; So, there was I, crowded

into



<P>the back seat with Henrietta and Louise; and I think it very likely



<P>that my illness to-day may be owing to it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A little further perseverance in patience and forced cheerfulness



<P>on Anne's side produced nearly a cure on Mary's.&nbsp; She could soon



<P>sit upright on the sofa, and began to hope she might be able



<P>to leave it by dinner-time.&nbsp; Then, forgetting to think of it,



<P>she was at the other end of the room, beautifying a nosegay;



<P>then, she ate her cold meat; and then she was well enough



<P>to propose a little walk.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Where shall we go?" said she, when they were ready.&nbsp; "I suppose



<P>you will not like to call at the Great House before they have



<P>been to see you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have not the smallest objection on that account," replied Anne.



<P>"I should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know



<P>so well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! but they ought to call upon you as soon as possible.



<P>They ought to feel what is due to you as my sister.&nbsp; However,



<P>we may as well go and sit with them a little&nbsp; while, and when we



<P>have that over, we can enjoy our walk."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent;



<P>but she had ceased to endeavour to check it, from believing that,



<P>though there were on each side continual subjects of offence,



<P>neither family could now do without it.&nbsp; To the Great House accordingly



<P>they went, to sit the full half hour in the old-fashioned square parlour,



<P>with a small carpet and shining floor, to which the present



<P>daughters of the house were gradually giving the proper air of confusion



<P>by a grand piano-forte and a harp, flower-stands and little tables



<P>placed in every direction.&nbsp; Oh! could the originals of the portraits



<P>against the wainscot, could the gentlemen in brown velvet and



<P>the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on, have been conscious



<P>of such an overthrow of all order and neatness!&nbsp; The portraits

themselves



<P>seemed to be staring in astonishment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Musgroves, like their houses, were in a state of alteration,



<P>perhaps of improvement.&nbsp; The father and mother were in the old



<P>English style, and the young people in the new.&nbsp; Mr and Mrs Musgrove



<P>were a very good sort of people; friendly and hospitable,



<P>not much educated, and not at all elegant.&nbsp; Their children had



<P>more modern minds and manners.&nbsp; There was a numerous family;



<P>but the only two grown up, excepting Charles, were Henrietta and Louisa,



<P>young ladies of nineteen and twenty, who had brought from school at

Exeter



<P>all the usual stock of accomplishments, and were now like thousands



<P>of other young ladies, living to be fashionable, happy, and merry.



<P>Their dress had every advantage, their faces were rather pretty,



<P>their spirits extremely good, their manner unembarrassed and pleasant;



<P>they were of consequence at home, and favourites abroad.



<P>Anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures



<P>of her acquaintance; but still, saved as we all are, by some



<P>comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility



<P>of exchange, she would not have given up her own more elegant



<P>and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments; and envied them nothing



<P>but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together,



<P>that good-humoured mutual affection, of which she had known



<P>so little herself with either of her sisters.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They were received with great cordiality.&nbsp; Nothing seemed amiss



<P>on the side of the Great House family, which was generally,



<P>as Anne very well knew, the least to blame.&nbsp; The half hour was



<P>chatted away pleasantly enough; and she was not at all surprised



<P>at the end of it, to have their walking party joined by both



<P>the Miss Musgroves, at Mary's particular invitation.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>The remainder of Anne's time at Uppercross, comprehending only two days,



<P>was spent entirely at the Mansion House; and she had the satisfaction



<P>of knowing herself extremely useful there, both as an immediate companion,



<P>and as assisting in all those arrangements for the future, which,



<P>in Mr and Mrs Musgrove's distressed state of spirits, would have



<P>been difficulties.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They had an early account from Lyme the next morning.&nbsp; Louisa was



<P>much the same.&nbsp; No symptoms worse than before had appeared.



<P>Charles came a few hours afterwards, to bring a later and



<P>more particular account.&nbsp; He was tolerably cheerful.&nbsp; A speedy

cure



<P>must not be hoped, but everything was going on as well



<P>as the nature of the case admitted.&nbsp; In speaking of the Harvilles,



<P>he seemed unable to satisfy his own sense of their kindness,



<P>especially of Mrs Harville's exertions as a nurse.&nbsp; "She really

left



<P>nothing for Mary to do.&nbsp; He and Mary had been persuaded to go early



<P>to their inn last night.&nbsp; Mary had been hysterical again this morning.



<P>When he came away, she was going to walk out with Captain Benwick,



<P>which, he hoped, would do her good.&nbsp; He almost wished she had been



<P>prevailed on to come home the day before; but the truth was,



<P>that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Charles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon, and his father



<P>had at first half a mind to go with him, but the ladies could not consent.



<P>It would be going only to multiply trouble to the others,



<P>and increase his own distress; and a much better scheme followed



<P>and was acted upon.&nbsp; A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne,



<P>and Charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery-maid



<P>of the family, one who having brought up all the children,



<P>and seen the very last, the lingering and long-petted Master Harry,



<P>sent to school after his brothers, was now living in her deserted nursery



<P>to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises she could



<P>get near her, and who, consequently, was only too happy in being



<P>allowed to go and help nurse dear Miss Louisa.&nbsp; Vague wishes of



<P>getting Sarah thither, had occurred before to Mrs Musgrove and Henrietta;



<P>but without Anne, it would hardly have been resolved on,



<P>and found practicable so soon.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They were indebted, the next day, to Charles Hayter, for all



<P>the minute knowledge of Louisa, which it was so essential to obtain



<P>every twenty-four hours.&nbsp; He made it his business to go to Lyme,



<P>and his account was still encouraging.&nbsp; The intervals of sense



<P>and consciousness were believed to be stronger.&nbsp; Every report agreed



<P>in Captain Wentworth's appearing fixed in Lyme.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne was to leave them on the morrow, an event which they all dreaded.



<P>"What should they do without her?&nbsp; They were wretched comforters



<P>for one another."&nbsp; And so much was said in this way, that Anne

thought



<P>she could not do better than impart among them the general inclination



<P>to which she was privy, and persuaded them all to go to Lyme at once.



<P>She had little difficulty; it was soon determined that they would go;



<P>go to-morrow, fix themselves at the inn, or get into lodgings,



<P>as it suited, and there remain till dear Louisa could be moved.



<P>They must be taking off some trouble from the good people she was with;



<P>they might at least relieve Mrs Harville from the care of her own children;



<P>and in short, they were so happy in the decision, that Anne was delighted



<P>with what she had done, and felt that she could not spend her



<P>last morning at Uppercross better than in assisting their preparations,



<P>and sending them off at an early hour, though her being left



<P>to the solitary range of the house was the consequence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was the last, excepting the little boys at the cottage,



<P>she was the very last, the only remaining one of all that had filled



<P>and animated both houses, of all that had given Uppercross



<P>its cheerful character.&nbsp; A few days had made a change indeed!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If Louisa recovered, it would all be well again.&nbsp; More than



<P>former happiness would be restored.&nbsp; There could not be a doubt,



<P>to her mind there was none, of what would follow her recovery.



<P>A few months hence, and the room now so deserted, occupied but by



<P>her silent, pensive self, might be filled again with all that was happy



<P>and gay, all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love,



<P>all that was most unlike Anne Elliot!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>An hour's complete leisure for such reflections as these,



<P>on a dark November day, a small thick rain almost blotting out



<P>the very few objects ever to be discerned from the windows, was enough



<P>to make the sound of Lady Russell's carriage exceedingly welcome;



<P>and yet, though desirous to be gone, she could not quit the Mansion

House,



<P>or look an adieu to the Cottage, with its black, dripping and



<P>comfortless veranda, or even notice through the misty glasses



<P>the last humble tenements of the village, without a saddened heart.



<P>Scenes had passed in Uppercross which made it precious.



<P>It stood the record of many sensations of pain, once severe,



<P>but now softened; and of some instances of relenting feeling,



<P>some breathings of friendship and reconciliation, which could



<P>never be looked for again, and which could never cease to be dear.



<P>She left it all behind her, all but the recollection that



<P>such things had been.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne had never entered Kellynch since her quitting Lady Russell's house



<P>in September.&nbsp; It had not been necessary, and the few occasions

of



<P>its being possible for her to go to the Hall she had contrived to evade



<P>and escape from.&nbsp; Her first return was to resume her place in the

modern



<P>and elegant apartments of the Lodge, and to gladden the eyes



<P>of its mistress.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was some anxiety mixed with Lady Russell's joy in meeting her.



<P>She knew who had been frequenting Uppercross.&nbsp; But happily,



<P>either Anne was improved in plumpness and looks, or Lady Russell



<P>fancied her so; and Anne, in receiving her compliments on the occasion,



<P>had the amusement of connecting them with the silent admiration



<P>of her cousin, and of hoping that she was to be blessed with



<P>a second spring of youth and beauty.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When they came to converse, she was soon sensible of some mental change.



<P>The subjects of which her heart had been full on leaving Kellynch,



<P>and which she had felt slighted, and been compelled to smother



<P>among the Musgroves, were now become but of secondary interest.



<P>She had lately lost sight even of her father and sister and Bath.



<P>Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross;



<P>and when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears,



<P>and spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place,



<P>which had been taken, and her regret that Mrs Clay should still



<P>be with them, Anne would have been ashamed to have it known



<P>how much more she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove,



<P>and all her acquaintance there; how much more interesting to her



<P>was the home and the friendship of the Harvilles and Captain Benwick,



<P>than her own father's house in Camden Place, or her own sister's intimacy



<P>with Mrs Clay.&nbsp; She was actually forced to exert herself



<P>to meet Lady Russell with anything like the appearance of equal solicitude,



<P>on topics which had by nature the first claim on her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse



<P>on another subject.&nbsp; They must speak of the accident at Lyme.



<P>Lady Russell had not been arrived five minutes the day before,



<P>when a full account of the whole had burst on her; but still it must



<P>be talked of, she must make enquiries, she must regret the imprudence,



<P>lament the result, and Captain Wentworth's name must be mentioned by

both.



<P>Anne was conscious of not doing it so well as Lady Russell.



<P>She could not speak the name, and look straight forward to



<P>Lady Russell's eye, till she had adopted the expedient of telling her



<P>briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and Louisa.



<P>When this was told, his name distressed her no longer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lady Russell had only to listen composedly, and wish them happy,



<P>but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt,



<P>that the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat



<P>of the value of an Anne Elliot, should, eight years afterwards,



<P>be charmed by a Louisa Musgrove.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The first three or four days passed most quietly, with no circumstance



<P>to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme,



<P>which found their way to Anne, she could not tell how, and brought



<P>a rather improving account of Louisa.&nbsp; At the end of that period,



<P>Lady Russell's politeness could repose no longer, and the fainter



<P>self-threatenings of the past became in a decided tone,



<P>"I must call on Mrs Croft; I really must call upon her soon.



<P>Anne, have you courage to go with me, and pay a visit in that house?



<P>It will be some trial to us both."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne did not shrink from it; on the contrary, she truly felt as she

said,



<P>in observing--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two;



<P>your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine.



<P>By remaining in the neighbourhood, I am become inured to it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She could have said more on the subject; for she had in fact



<P>so high an opinion of the Crofts, and considered her father



<P>so very fortunate in his tenants, felt the parish to be so sure



<P>of a good example, and the poor of the best attention and relief,



<P>that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal,



<P>she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone



<P>who deserved not to stay, and that Kellynch Hall had passed



<P>into better hands than its owners'.&nbsp; These convictions must unquestionably



<P>have their own pain, and severe was its kind; but they precluded



<P>that pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the house again,



<P>and returning through the well-known apartments.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In such moments Anne had no power of saying to herself,



<P>"These rooms ought to belong only to us.&nbsp; Oh, how fallen



<P>in their destination!&nbsp; How unworthily occupied!&nbsp; An ancient

family



<P>to be so driven away!&nbsp; Strangers filling their place!"



<P>No, except when she thought of her mother, and remembered where



<P>she had been used to sit and preside, she had no sigh of that description



<P>to heave.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs Croft always met her with a kindness which gave her the pleasure



<P>of fancying herself a favourite, and on the present occasion,



<P>receiving her in that house, there was particular attention.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The sad accident at Lyme was soon the prevailing topic,



<P>and on comparing their latest accounts of the invalid, it appeared



<P>that each lady dated her intelligence from the same hour of yestermorn;



<P>that Captain Wentworth had been in Kellynch yesterday (the first time



<P>since the accident), had brought Anne the last note, which she had



<P>not been able to trace the exact steps of; had staid a few hours



<P>and then returned again to Lyme, and without any present intention



<P>of quitting it any more.&nbsp; He had enquired after her, she found,



<P>particularly; had expressed his hope of Miss Elliot's not being



<P>the worse for her exertions, and had spoken of those exertions as great.



<P>This was handsome, and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else



<P>could have done.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As to the sad catastrophe itself, it could be canvassed only in one

style



<P>by a couple of steady, sensible women, whose judgements had to work



<P>on ascertained events; and it was perfectly decided that it had been



<P>the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence;



<P>that its effects were most alarming, and that it was frightful to think,



<P>how long Miss Musgrove's recovery might yet be doubtful, and how liable



<P>she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter!



<P>The Admiral wound it up summarily by exclaiming--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ay, a very bad business indeed.&nbsp; A new sort of way this,



<P>for a young fellow to be making love, by breaking his mistress's head,



<P>is not it, Miss Elliot?&nbsp; This is breaking a head and giving a plaster,



<P>truly!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Admiral Croft's manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady Russell,



<P>but they delighted Anne.&nbsp; His goodness of heart and simplicity



<P>of character were irresistible.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now, this must be very bad for you," said he, suddenly rousing from



<P>a little reverie, "to be coming and finding us here.&nbsp; I had not



<P>recollected it before, I declare, but it must be very bad.



<P>But now, do not stand upon ceremony.&nbsp; Get up and go over all the

rooms



<P>in the house if you like it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Another time, Sir, I thank you, not now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, whenever it suits you.&nbsp; You can slip in from the shrubbery



<P>at any time; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up



<P>by that door.&nbsp; A good place is not it?&nbsp; But," (checking himself),



<P>"you will not think it a good place, for yours were always kept



<P>in the butler's room.&nbsp; Ay, so it always is, I believe.



<P>One man's ways may be as good as another's, but we all like our own

best.



<P>And so you must judge for yourself, whether it would be better for you



<P>to go about the house or not."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne, finding she might decline it, did so, very gratefully.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We have made very few changes either," continued the Admiral,



<P>after thinking a moment.&nbsp; "Very few.&nbsp; We told you about the

laundry-door,



<P>at Uppercross.&nbsp; That has been a very great improvement.



<P>The wonder was, how any family upon earth could bear with the inconvenience



<P>of its opening as it did, so long!&nbsp; You will tell Sir Walter



<P>what we have done, and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement



<P>the house ever had.&nbsp; Indeed, I must do ourselves the justice to

say,



<P>that the few alterations we have made have been all very much



<P>for the better.&nbsp; My wife should have the credit of them, however.



<P>I have done very little besides sending away some of the large



<P>looking-glasses from my dressing-room, which was your father's.



<P>A very good man, and very much the gentleman I am sure:



<P>but I should think, Miss Elliot," (looking with serious reflection),



<P>"I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life.



<P>Such a number of looking-glasses! oh Lord! there was no getting away



<P>from one's self.&nbsp; So I got Sophy to lend me a hand, and we soon



<P>shifted their quarters; and now I am quite snug, with my



<P>little shaving glass in one corner, and another great thing



<P>that I never go near."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne, amused in spite of herself, was rather distressed for an answer,



<P>and the Admiral, fearing he might not have been civil enough,



<P>took up the subject again, to say--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The next time you write to your good father, Miss Elliot,



<P>pray give him my compliments and Mrs Croft's, and say that we are



<P>settled here quite to our liking, and have no fault at all to find



<P>with the place.&nbsp; The breakfast-room chimney smokes a little,



<P>I grant you, but it is only when the wind is due north and blows hard,



<P>which may not happen three times a winter.&nbsp; And take it altogether,



<P>now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge,



<P>there is not one that we like better than this.&nbsp; Pray say so,



<P>with my compliments.&nbsp; He will be glad to hear it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other:



<P>but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed



<P>far at present; for when it was returned, the Crofts announced



<P>themselves to be going away for a few weeks, to visit their connexions



<P>in the north of the county, and probably might not be at home again



<P>before Lady Russell would be removing to Bath.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch

Hall,



<P>or of seeing him in company with her friend.&nbsp; Everything was safe

enough,



<P>and she smiled over the many anxious feelings she had wasted



<P>on the subject.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>A very few days more, and Captain Wentworth was known to be at Kellynch,



<P>and Mr Musgrove had called on him, and come back warm in his praise,



<P>and he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross,



<P>by the end of another week.&nbsp; It had been a great disappointment



<P>to Mr Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed,



<P>so impatient was he to shew his gratitude, by seeing Captain Wentworth



<P>under his own roof, and welcoming him to all that was strongest



<P>and best in his cellars.&nbsp; But a week must pass; only a week,



<P>in Anne's reckoning, and then, she supposed, they must meet;



<P>and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Captain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove's civility,



<P>and she was all but calling there in the same half hour.



<P>She and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House,



<P>where, as she afterwards learnt, they must inevitably have found him,



<P>when they were stopped by the eldest boy's being at that moment



<P>brought home in consequence of a bad fall.&nbsp; The child's situation



<P>put the visit entirely aside; but she could not hear of her escape



<P>with indifference, even in the midst of the serious anxiety



<P>which they afterwards felt on his account.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His collar-bone was found to be dislocated, and such injury



<P>received in the back, as roused the most alarming ideas.



<P>It was an afternoon of distress, and Anne had every thing to do at once;



<P>the apothecary to send for, the father to have pursued and informed,



<P>the mother to support and keep from hysterics, the servants to control,



<P>the youngest child to banish, and the poor suffering one to attend



<P>and soothe; besides sending, as soon as she recollected it,



<P>proper notice to the other house, which brought her an accession



<P>rather of frightened, enquiring companions, than of very useful assistants.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her brother's return was the first comfort; he could take best care



<P>of his wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary.



<P>Till he came and had examined the child, their apprehensions were



<P>the worse for being vague; they suspected great injury, but knew not

where;



<P>but now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though Mr Robinson



<P>felt and felt, and rubbed, and looked grave, and spoke low words



<P>both to the father and the aunt, still they were all to hope the best,



<P>and to be able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind;



<P>and then it was, just before they parted, that the two young aunts



<P>were able so far to digress from their nephew's state, as to give



<P>the information of Captain Wentworth's visit; staying five minutes behind



<P>their father and mother, to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted



<P>they were with him, how much handsomer, how infinitely more agreeable



<P>they thought him than any individual among their male acquaintance,



<P>who had been at all a favourite before.&nbsp; How glad they had been



<P>to hear papa invite him to stay dinner, how sorry when he said



<P>it was quite out of his power, and how glad again when he had promised



<P>in reply to papa and mamma's farther pressing invitations to come



<P>and dine with them on the morrow--actually on the morrow;



<P>and he had promised it in so pleasant a manner, as if he felt



<P>all the motive of their attention just as he ought.&nbsp; And in short,



<P>he had looked and said everything with such exquisite grace,



<P>that they could assure them all, their heads were both turned by him;



<P>and off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and apparently



<P>more full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The same story and the same raptures were repeated, when the two girls

came



<P>with their father, through the gloom of the evening, to make enquiries;



<P>and Mr Musgrove, no longer under the first uneasiness about his heir,



<P>could add his confirmation and praise, and hope there would be now



<P>no occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off, and only be sorry to

think



<P>that the cottage party, probably, would not like to leave the little

boy,



<P>to give him the meeting.&nbsp; "Oh no; as to leaving the little boy,"



<P>both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm



<P>to bear the thought; and Anne, in the joy of the escape,



<P>could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Charles Musgrove, indeed, afterwards, shewed more of inclination;



<P>"the child was going on so well, and he wished so much to be introduced



<P>to Captain Wentworth, that, perhaps, he might join them in the evening;



<P>he would not dine from home, but he might walk in for half an hour."



<P>But in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife, with "Oh! no, indeed,



<P>Charles, I cannot bear to have you go away.&nbsp; Only think if anything



<P>should happen?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The child had a good night, and was going on well the next day.



<P>It must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been



<P>done to the spine; but Mr Robinson found nothing to increase alarm,



<P>and Charles Musgrove began, consequently, to feel no necessity



<P>for longer confinement.&nbsp; The child was to be kept in bed and amused



<P>as quietly as possible; but what was there for a father to do?



<P>This was quite a female case, and it would be highly absurd in him,



<P>who could be of no use at home, to shut himself up.&nbsp; His father



<P>very much wished him to meet Captain Wentworth, and there being



<P>no sufficient reason against it, he ought to go; and it ended in his



<P>making a bold, public declaration, when he came in from shooting,



<P>of his meaning to dress directly, and dine at the other house.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nothing can be going on better than the child," said he;



<P>"so I told my father, just now, that I would come, and he thought me



<P>quite right.&nbsp; Your sister being with you, my love, I have no scruple

at all.



<P>You would not like to leave him yourself, but you see I can be of no

use.



<P>Anne will send for me if anything is the matter."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain.



<P>Mary knew, from Charles's manner of speaking, that he was



<P>quite determined on going, and that it would be of no use to teaze him.



<P>She said nothing, therefore, till he was out of the room,



<P>but as soon as there was only Anne to hear--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this



<P>poor sick child; and not a creature coming near us all the evening!



<P>I knew how it would be.&nbsp; This is always my luck.&nbsp; If there

is



<P>anything disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it,



<P>and Charles is as bad as any of them.&nbsp; Very unfeeling!&nbsp; I

must say



<P>it is very unfeeling of him to be running away from his poor little

boy.



<P>Talks of his being going on so well!&nbsp; How does he know that he

is



<P>going on well, or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour

hence?



<P>I did not think Charles would have been so unfeeling.&nbsp; So here

he is to



<P>go away and enjoy himself, and because I am the poor mother,



<P>I am not to be allowed to stir; and yet, I am sure, I am more unfit



<P>than anybody else to be about the child.&nbsp; My being the mother



<P>is the very reason why my feelings should not be tried.&nbsp; I am not

at all



<P>equal to it.&nbsp; You saw how hysterical I was yesterday."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm--



<P>of the shock.&nbsp; You will not be hysterical again.&nbsp; I dare say

we shall have



<P>nothing to distress us.&nbsp; I perfectly understand Mr Robinson's directions,



<P>and have no fears; and indeed, Mary, I cannot wonder at your husband.



<P>Nursing does not belong to a man; it is not his province.



<P>A sick child is always the mother's property:&nbsp; her own feelings



<P>generally make it so."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother, but I do not know



<P>that I am of any more use in the sick-room than Charles,



<P>for I cannot be always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is

ill;



<P>and you saw, this morning, that if I told him to keep quiet,



<P>he was sure to begin kicking about.&nbsp; I have not nerves



<P>for the sort of thing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But, could you be comfortable yourself, to be spending



<P>the whole evening away from the poor boy?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes; you see his papa can, and why should not I?&nbsp; Jemima is so

careful;



<P>and she could send us word every hour how he was.&nbsp; I really think



<P>Charles might as well have told his father we would all come.



<P>I am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is.



<P>I was dreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different to-day."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself,



<P>suppose you were to go, as well as your husband.&nbsp; Leave little

Charles



<P>to my care.&nbsp; Mr and Mrs Musgrove cannot think it wrong while I

remain



<P>with him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Are you serious?" cried Mary, her eyes brightening.&nbsp; "Dear me!



<P>that's a very good thought, very good, indeed.&nbsp; To be sure,



<P>I may just as well go as not, for I am of no use at home--am I?



<P>and it only harasses me.&nbsp; You, who have not a mother's feelings,



<P>are a great deal the properest person.&nbsp; You can make little Charles



<P>do anything; he always minds you at a word.&nbsp; It will be a great

deal better



<P>than leaving him only with Jemima.&nbsp; Oh! I shall certainly go;



<P>I am sure I ought if I can, quite as much as Charles, for they want

me



<P>excessively to be acquainted with Captain Wentworth, and I know



<P>you do not mind being left alone.&nbsp; An excellent thought of yours,



<P>indeed, Anne.&nbsp; I will go and tell Charles, and get ready directly.



<P>You can send for us, you know, at a moment's notice, if anything



<P>is the matter; but I dare say there will be nothing to alarm you.



<P>I should not go, you may be sure, if I did not feel quite at ease



<P>about my dear child."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The next moment she was tapping at her husband's dressing-room door,



<P>and as Anne followed her up stairs, she was in time for



<P>the whole conversation, which began with Mary's saying,



<P>in a tone of great exultation--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I mean to go with you, Charles, for I am of no more use at home



<P>than you are.&nbsp; If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child,



<P>I should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like.



<P>Anne will stay; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him.



<P>It is Anne's own proposal, and so I shall go with you, which will be



<P>a great deal better, for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This is very kind of Anne," was her husband's answer, "and I should

be



<P>very glad to have you go; but it seems rather hard that she should be



<P>left at home by herself, to nurse our sick child."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne was now at hand to take up her own cause, and the sincerity



<P>of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him, where conviction



<P>was at least very agreeable, he had no farther scruples as to her being



<P>left to dine alone, though he still wanted her to join them in the evening,



<P>when the child might be at rest for the night, and kindly urged her



<P>to let him come and fetch her, but she was quite unpersuadable;



<P>and this being the case, she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them



<P>set off together in high spirits.&nbsp; They were gone, she hoped,



<P>to be happy, however oddly constructed such happiness might seem;



<P>as for herself, she was left with as many sensations of comfort,



<P>as were, perhaps, ever likely to be hers.&nbsp; She knew herself to

be



<P>of the first utility to the child; and what was it to her



<P>if Frederick Wentworth were only half a mile distant, making himself



<P>agreeable to others?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting.



<P>Perhaps indifferent, if indifference could exist under such circumstances.



<P>He must be either indifferent or unwilling.&nbsp; Had he wished



<P>ever to see her again, he need not have waited till this time;



<P>he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place



<P>she should have done long ago, when events had been early giving him



<P>the independence which alone had been wanting.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance,



<P>and their visit in general.&nbsp; There had been music, singing,



<P>talking, laughing, all that was most agreeable; charming manners



<P>in Captain Wentworth, no shyness or reserve; they seemed all



<P>to know each other perfectly, and he was coming the very next morning



<P>to shoot with Charles.&nbsp; He was to come to breakfast, but not at

the Cottage,



<P>though that had been proposed at first; but then he had been pressed



<P>to come to the Great House instead, and he seemed afraid of being



<P>in Mrs Charles Musgrove's way, on account of the child, and therefore,



<P>somehow, they hardly knew how, it ended in Charles's being to meet him



<P>to breakfast at his father's.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne understood it.&nbsp; He wished to avoid seeing her.&nbsp; He had

inquired



<P>after her, she found, slightly, as might suit a former slight acquaintance,



<P>seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged, actuated, perhaps,



<P>by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those



<P>of the other house, and on the morrow the difference was so great



<P>that Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when



<P>Charles came in to say that they were just setting off, that he was



<P>come for his dogs, that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth;



<P>his sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child, and Captain Wentworth



<P>proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient;



<P>and though Charles had answered for the child's being in no such state



<P>as could make it inconvenient, Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied



<P>without his running on to give notice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mary, very much gratified by this attention, was delighted to receive

him,



<P>while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne, of which this was



<P>the most consoling, that it would soon be over.&nbsp; And it was soon

over.



<P>In two minutes after Charles's preparation, the others appeared;



<P>they were in the drawing-room.&nbsp; Her eye half met Captain Wentworth's,



<P>a bow, a curtsey passed; she heard his voice; he talked to Mary,



<P>said all that was right, said something to the Miss Musgroves,



<P>enough to mark an easy footing; the room seemed full, full of persons



<P>and voices, but a few minutes ended it.&nbsp; Charles shewed himself



<P>at the window, all was ready, their visitor had bowed and was gone,



<P>the Miss Musgroves were gone too, suddenly resolving to walk



<P>to the end of the village with the sportsmen:&nbsp; the room was cleared,



<P>and Anne might finish her breakfast as she could.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is over! it is over!" she repeated to herself again and again,



<P>in nervous gratitude.&nbsp; "The worst is over!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mary talked, but she could not attend.&nbsp; She had seen him.



<P>They had met.&nbsp; They had been once more in the same room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Soon, however, she began to reason with herself, and try to be feeling

less.



<P>Eight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had been given

up.



<P>How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval



<P>had banished into distance and indistinctness!&nbsp; What might not



<P>eight years do?&nbsp; Events of every description, changes, alienations,



<P>removals--all, all must be comprised in it, and oblivion of the past--



<P>how natural, how certain too!&nbsp; It included nearly a third part



<P>of her own life.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Alas! with all her reasoning, she found, that to retentive feelings



<P>eight years may be little more than nothing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, how were his sentiments to be read?&nbsp; Was this like



<P>wishing to avoid her?&nbsp; And the next moment she was hating herself



<P>for the folly which asked the question.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom



<P>might not have prevented, she was soon spared all suspense;



<P>for, after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit



<P>at the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from Mary: --

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you, Anne, though he was



<P>so attentive to me.&nbsp; Henrietta asked him what he thought of you,



<P>when they went away, and he said, `You were so altered he should not



<P>have known you again.'"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mary had no feelings to make her respect her sister's in a common way,



<P>but she was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar

wound.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Altered beyond his knowledge."&nbsp; Anne fully submitted, in silent,



<P>deep mortification.&nbsp; Doubtless it was so, and she could take no

revenge,



<P>for he was not altered, or not for the worse.&nbsp; She had already



<P>acknowledged it to herself, and she could not think differently,



<P>let him think of her as he would.&nbsp; No:&nbsp; the years which had

destroyed



<P>her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing, manly,



<P>open look, in no respect lessening his personal advantages.



<P>She had seen the same Frederick Wentworth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So altered that he should not have known her again!"&nbsp; These were

words



<P>which could not but dwell with her.&nbsp; Yet she soon began to rejoice



<P>that she had heard them.&nbsp; They were of sobering tendency;



<P>they allayed agitation; they composed, and consequently must



<P>make her happier.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Frederick Wentworth had used such words, or something like them,



<P>but without an idea that they would be carried round to her.



<P>He had thought her wretchedly altered, and in the first moment of appeal,



<P>had spoken as he felt.&nbsp; He had not forgiven Anne Elliot.



<P>She had used him ill, deserted and disappointed him; and worse,



<P>she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so, which his own decided,



<P>confident temper could not endure.&nbsp; She had given him up to oblige

others.



<P>It had been the effect of over-persuasion.&nbsp; It had been



<P>weakness and timidity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had been most warmly attached to her, and had never seen a woman

since



<P>whom he thought her equal; but, except from some natural sensation



<P>of curiosity, he had no desire of meeting her again.&nbsp; Her power

with him



<P>was gone for ever.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was now his object to marry.&nbsp; He was rich, and being turned

on shore,



<P>fully intended to settle as soon as he could be properly tempted;



<P>actually looking round, ready to fall in love with all the speed



<P>which a clear head and a quick taste could allow.&nbsp; He had a heart



<P>for either of the Miss Musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart,



<P>in short, for any pleasing young woman who came in his way,



<P>excepting Anne Elliot.&nbsp; This was his only secret exception,



<P>when he said to his sister, in answer to her suppositions:--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, here I am, Sophia, quite ready to make a foolish match.



<P>Anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking.



<P>A little beauty, and a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy,



<P>and I am a lost man.&nbsp; Should not this be enough for a sailor,



<P>who has had no society among women to make him nice?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He said it, she knew, to be contradicted.&nbsp; His bright proud eye



<P>spoke the conviction that he was nice; and Anne Elliot was



<P>not out of his thoughts, when he more seriously described



<P>the woman he should wish to meet with.&nbsp; "A strong mind,



<P>with sweetness of manner," made the first and the last of the description.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That is the woman I want," said he.&nbsp; "Something a little inferior



<P>I shall of course put up with, but it must not be much.&nbsp; If I am

a fool,



<P>I shall be a fool indeed, for I have thought on the subject



<P>more than most men."

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Anne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross, to learn that a removal



<P>from one set of people to another, though at a distance of only three

miles,



<P>will often include a total change of conversation, opinion, and idea.



<P>She had never been staying there before, without being struck by it,



<P>or without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage



<P>in seeing how unknown, or unconsidered there, were the affairs



<P>which at Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity



<P>and pervading interest; yet, with all this experience, she believed



<P>she must now submit to feel that another lesson, in the art of knowing



<P>our own nothingness beyond our own circle, was become necessary for

her;



<P>for certainly, coming as she did, with a heart full of the subject



<P>which had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many

weeks,



<P>she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found



<P>in the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove:



<P>"So, Miss Anne, Sir Walter and your sister are gone; and what part of

Bath



<P>do you think they will settle in?" and this, without much



<P>waiting for an answer; or in the young ladies' addition of,



<P>"I hope we shall be in Bath in the winter; but remember, papa,



<P>if we do go, we must be in a good situation:&nbsp; none of your



<P>Queen Squares for us!" or in the anxious supplement from Mary, of--



<P>"Upon my word, I shall be pretty well off, when you are all gone away



<P>to be happy at Bath!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in future,



<P>and think with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing



<P>of having one such truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard, and to destroy,



<P>their own horses, dogs, and newspapers to engage them, and the females



<P>were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping,



<P>neighbours, dress, dancing, and music.&nbsp; She acknowledged it to

be



<P>very fitting, that every little social commonwealth should dictate



<P>its own matters of discourse; and hoped, ere long, to become



<P>a not unworthy member of the one she was now transplanted into.



<P>With the prospect of spending at least two months at Uppercross,



<P>it was highly incumbent on her to clothe her imagination, her memory,



<P>and all her ideas in as much of Uppercross as possible.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had no dread of these two months.&nbsp; Mary was not so repulsive



<P>and unsisterly as Elizabeth, nor so inaccessible to all influence of

hers;



<P>neither was there anything among the other component parts



<P>of the cottage inimical to comfort.&nbsp; She was always on friendly

terms



<P>with her brother-in-law; and in the children, who loved her nearly as

well,



<P>and respected her a great deal more than their mother, she had



<P>an object of interest, amusement, and wholesome exertion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable; in sense and temper he was



<P>undoubtedly superior to his wife, but not of powers, or conversation,



<P>or grace, to make the past, as they were connected together,



<P>at all a dangerous contemplation; though, at the same time,



<P>Anne could believe, with Lady Russell, that a more equal match



<P>might have greatly improved him; and that a woman of real understanding



<P>might have given more consequence to his character, and more usefulness,



<P>rationality, and elegance to his habits and pursuits.&nbsp; As it was,



<P>he did nothing with much zeal, but sport; and his time was otherwise



<P>trifled away, without benefit from books or anything else.



<P>He had very good spirits, which never seemed much affected by



<P>his wife's occasional lowness, bore with her unreasonableness



<P>sometimes to Anne's admiration, and upon the whole, though there was



<P>very often a little disagreement (in which she had sometimes more share



<P>than she wished, being appealed to by both parties), they might pass



<P>for a happy couple.&nbsp; They were always perfectly agreed in the want



<P>of more money, and a strong inclination for a handsome present



<P>from his father; but here, as on most topics, he had the superiority,



<P>for while Mary thought it a great shame that such a present was not

made,



<P>he always contended for his father's having many other uses for his

money,



<P>and a right to spend it as he liked.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As to the management of their children, his theory was much better



<P>than his wife's, and his practice not so bad.&nbsp; "I could manage

them



<P>very well, if it were not for Mary's interference," was what



<P>Anne often heard him say, and had a good deal of faith in;



<P>but when listening in turn to Mary's reproach of "Charles spoils



<P>the children so that I cannot get them into any order," she never had



<P>the smallest temptation to say, "Very true."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One of the least agreeable circumstances of her residence there



<P>was her being treated with too much confidence by all parties,



<P>and being too much in the secret of the complaints of each house.



<P>Known to have some influence with her sister, she was continually requested,



<P>or at least receiving hints to exert it, beyond what was practicable.



<P>"I wish you could persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill,"



<P>was Charles's language; and, in an unhappy mood, thus spoke Mary:



<P>"I do believe if Charles were to see me dying, he would not think



<P>there was anything the matter with me.&nbsp; I am sure, Anne, if you

would,



<P>you might persuade him that I really am very ill--a great deal worse



<P>than I ever own."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mary's declaration was, "I hate sending the children to the Great House,



<P>though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them, for she humours



<P>and indulges them to such a degree, and gives them so much trash



<P>and sweet things, that they are sure to come back sick and cross



<P>for the rest of the day."&nbsp; And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity



<P>of being alone with Anne, to say, "Oh! Miss Anne, I cannot help wishing



<P>Mrs Charles had a little of your method with those children.



<P>They are quite different creatures with you!&nbsp; But to be sure,



<P>in general they are so spoilt!&nbsp; It is a pity you cannot put your

sister



<P>in the way of managing them.&nbsp; They are as fine healthy children



<P>as ever were seen, poor little dears! without partiality;



<P>but Mrs Charles knows no more how they should be treated--!



<P>Bless me! how troublesome they are sometimes.&nbsp; I assure you, Miss

Anne,



<P>it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as



<P>I otherwise should.&nbsp; I believe Mrs Charles is not quite pleased



<P>with my not inviting them oftener; but you know it is very bad



<P>to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking



<P>every moment; "don't do this," and "don't do that;"&nbsp; or that one

can



<P>only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had this communication, moreover, from Mary.&nbsp; "Mrs Musgrove

thinks



<P>all her servants so steady, that it would be high treason



<P>to call it in question; but I am sure, without exaggeration,



<P>that her upper house-maid and laundry-maid, instead of being



<P>in their business, are gadding about the village, all day long.



<P>I meet them wherever I go; and I declare, I never go twice into my nursery



<P>without seeing something of them.&nbsp; If Jemima were not the trustiest,



<P>steadiest creature in the world, it would be enough to spoil her;



<P>for she tells me, they are always tempting her to take a walk with them."



<P>And on Mrs Musgrove's side, it was, "I make a rule of never interfering



<P>in any of my daughter-in-law's concerns, for I know it would not do;



<P>but I shall tell you, Miss Anne, because you may be able to set things



<P>to rights, that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles's nursery-maid:



<P>I hear strange stories of her; she is always upon the gad; and from



<P>my own knowledge, I can declare, she is such a fine-dressing lady,



<P>that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near.



<P>Mrs Charles quite swears by her, I know; but I just give you this hint,



<P>that you may be upon the watch; because, if you see anything amiss,



<P>you need not be afraid of mentioning it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Again, it was Mary's complaint, that Mrs Musgrove was very apt



<P>not to give her the precedence that was her due, when they dined



<P>at the Great House with other families; and she did not see any reason



<P>why she was to be considered so much at home as to lose her place.



<P>And one day when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves, one of them



<P>after talking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said,



<P>"I have no scruple of observing to you, how nonsensical some persons

are



<P>about their place, because all the world knows how easy and indifferent



<P>you are about it; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that



<P>it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious,



<P>especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take



<P>place of mamma.&nbsp; Nobody doubts her right to have precedence of

mamma,



<P>but it would be more becoming in her not to be always insisting on it.



<P>It is not that mamma cares about it the least in the world,



<P>but I know it is taken notice of by many persons."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>How was Anne to set all these matters to rights?&nbsp; She could do

little more



<P>than listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each



<P>to the other; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary



<P>between such near neighbours, and make those hints broadest



<P>which were meant for her sister's benefit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In all other respects, her visit began and proceeded very well.



<P>Her own spirits improved by change of place and subject,



<P>by being removed three miles from Kellynch; Mary's ailments lessened



<P>by having a constant companion, and their daily intercourse



<P>with the other family, since there was neither superior affection,



<P>confidence, nor employment in the cottage, to be interrupted by it,



<P>was rather an advantage.&nbsp; It was certainly carried nearly as far

as possible,



<P>for they met every morning, and hardly ever spent an evening asunder;



<P>but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight



<P>of Mr and Mrs Musgrove's respectable forms in the usual places,



<P>or without the talking, laughing, and singing of their daughters.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves,



<P>but having no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents,



<P>to sit by and fancy themselves delighted, her performance was



<P>little thought of, only out of civility, or to refresh the others,



<P>as she was well aware.&nbsp; She knew that when she played she was



<P>giving pleasure only to herself; but this was no new sensation.



<P>Excepting one short period of her life, she had never, since the age



<P>of fourteen, never since the loss of her dear mother, know the happiness



<P>of being listened to, or encouraged by any just appreciation or real

taste.



<P>In music she had been always used to feel alone in the world;



<P>and Mr and Mrs Musgrove's fond partiality for their own daughters'



<P>performance, and total indifference to any other person's,



<P>gave her much more pleasure for their sakes, than mortification



<P>for her own.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company.



<P>The neighbourhood was not large, but the Musgroves were visited



<P>by everybody, and had more dinner-parties, and more callers,



<P>more visitors by invitation and by chance, than any other family.



<P>There were more completely popular.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The girls were wild for dancing; and the evenings ended, occasionally,



<P>in an unpremeditated little ball.&nbsp; There was a family of cousins



<P>within a walk of Uppercross, in less affluent circumstances,



<P>who depended on the Musgroves for all their pleasures:&nbsp; they would

come



<P>at any time, and help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and Anne,



<P>very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post,



<P>played country dances to them by the hour together; a kindness which



<P>always recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove



<P>more than anything else, and often drew this compliment;--



<P>"Well done, Miss Anne! very well done indeed!&nbsp; Lord bless me!



<P>how those little fingers of yours fly about!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So passed the first three weeks.&nbsp; Michaelmas came; and now Anne's

heart



<P>must be in Kellynch again.&nbsp; A beloved home made over to others;



<P>all the precious rooms and furniture, groves, and prospects,



<P>beginning to own other eyes and other limbs!&nbsp; She could not



<P>think of much else on the 29th of September; and she had this



<P>sympathetic touch in the evening from Mary, who, on having occasion



<P>to note down the day of the month, exclaimed, "Dear me, is not this



<P>the day the Crofts were to come to Kellynch?&nbsp; I am glad I did not



<P>think of it before.&nbsp; How low it makes me!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Crofts took possession with true naval alertness, and were



<P>to be visited.&nbsp; Mary deplored the necessity for herself.



<P>"Nobody knew how much she should suffer.&nbsp; She should put it off



<P>as long as she could;" but was not easy till she had talked Charles



<P>into driving her over on an early day, and was in a very animated,



<P>comfortable state of imaginary agitation, when she came back.



<P>Anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going.



<P>She wished, however to see the Crofts, and was glad to be within



<P>when the visit was returned.&nbsp; They came:&nbsp; the master of the

house



<P>was not at home, but the two sisters were together; and as it chanced



<P>that Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne, while the Admiral sat by Mary,



<P>and made himself very agreeable by his good-humoured notice



<P>of her little boys, she was well able to watch for a likeness,



<P>and if it failed her in the features, to catch it in the voice,



<P>or in the turn of sentiment and expression.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs Croft, though neither tall nor fat, had a squareness,



<P>uprightness, and vigour of form, which gave importance to her person.



<P>She had bright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face;



<P>though her reddened and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence



<P>of her having been almost as much at sea as her husband, made her seem

to



<P>have lived some years longer in the world than her real eight-and-thirty.



<P>Her manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had



<P>no distrust of herself, and no doubts of what to do; without any



<P>approach to coarseness, however, or any want of good humour.



<P>Anne gave her credit, indeed, for feelings of great consideration



<P>towards herself, in all that related to Kellynch, and it pleased her:



<P>especially, as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute,



<P>in the instant even of introduction, that there was not the smallest



<P>symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Croft's side, to give a

bias



<P>of any sort.&nbsp; She was quite easy on that head, and consequently



<P>full of strength and courage, till for a moment electrified by



<P>Mrs Croft's suddenly saying,--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It was you, and not your sister, I find, that my brother had



<P>the pleasure of being acquainted with, when he was in this country."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion



<P>she certainly had not.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Perhaps you may not have heard that he is married?" added Mrs Croft.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She could now answer as she ought; and was happy to feel,



<P>when Mrs Croft's next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth



<P>of whom she spoke, that she had said nothing which might not do



<P>for either brother. She immediately felt how reasonable it was,



<P>that Mrs Croft should be thinking and speaking of Edward,



<P>and not of Frederick; and with shame at her own forgetfulness



<P>applied herself to the knowledge of their former neighbour's



<P>present state with proper interest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The rest was all tranquillity; till, just as they were moving,



<P>she heard the Admiral say to Mary--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft's here soon; I dare say



<P>you know him by name."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys,



<P>clinging to him like an old friend, and declaring he should not go;



<P>and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away



<P>in his coat pockets, &amp;c., to have another moment for finishing



<P>or recollecting what he had begun, Anne was left to persuade herself,



<P>as well as she could, that the same brother must still be in question.



<P>She could not, however, reach such a degree of certainty,



<P>as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject



<P>at the other house, where the Crofts had previously been calling.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day



<P>at the Cottage; and it being now too late in the year for such visits



<P>to be made on foot, the coach was beginning to be listened for,



<P>when the youngest Miss Musgrove walked in.&nbsp; That she was coming



<P>to apologize, and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves,



<P>was the first black idea; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted,



<P>when Louisa made all right by saying, that she only came on foot,



<P>to leave more room for the harp, which was bringing in the carriage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And I will tell you our reason," she added, "and all about it.



<P>I am come on to give you notice, that papa and mamma are



<P>out of spirits this evening, especially mamma; she is thinking so much



<P>of poor Richard!&nbsp; And we agreed it would be best to have the harp,



<P>for it seems to amuse her more than the piano-forte.&nbsp; I will tell

you



<P>why she is out of spirits.&nbsp; When the Crofts called this morning,



<P>(they called here afterwards, did not they?), they happened to say,



<P>that her brother, Captain Wentworth, is just returned to England,



<P>or paid off, or something, and is coming to see them almost directly;



<P>and most unluckily it came into mamma's head, when they were gone,



<P>that Wentworth, or something very like it, was the name of



<P>poor Richard's captain at one time; I do not know when or where,



<P>but a great while before he died, poor fellow!&nbsp; And upon looking

over



<P>his letters and things, she found it was so, and is perfectly sure



<P>that this must be the very man, and her head is quite full of it,



<P>and of poor Richard!&nbsp; So we must be as merry as we can, that she

may not



<P>be dwelling upon such gloomy things."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were,



<P>that the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome,



<P>hopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached



<P>his twentieth year; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid



<P>and unmanageable on shore; that he had been very little cared for



<P>at any time by his family, though quite as much as he deserved;



<P>seldom heard of, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence



<P>of his death abroad had worked its way to Uppercross, two years before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had, in fact, though his sisters were now doing all they could for

him,



<P>by calling him "poor Richard," been nothing better than a thick-headed,



<P>unfeeling, unprofitable Dick Musgrove, who had never done anything



<P>to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name,



<P>living or dead.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of those removals



<P>to which all midshipmen are liable, and especially such midshipmen



<P>as every captain wishes to get rid of, been six months on board



<P>Captain Frederick Wentworth's frigate, the Laconia; and from the Laconia



<P>he had, under the influence of his captain, written the only two letters



<P>which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole



<P>of his absence; that is to say, the only two disinterested letters;



<P>all the rest had been mere applications for money.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In each letter he had spoken well of his captain; but yet,



<P>so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters,



<P>so unobservant and incurious were they as to the names of men or ships,



<P>that it had made scarcely any impression at the time; and that Mrs Musgrove



<P>should have been suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection



<P>of the name of Wentworth, as connected with her son, seemed one of those



<P>extraordinary bursts of mind which do sometimes occur.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had gone to her letters, and found it all as she supposed;



<P>and the re-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval,



<P>her poor son gone for ever, and all the strength of his faults forgotten,



<P>had affected her spirits exceedingly, and thrown her into



<P>greater grief for him than she had know on first hearing of his death.



<P>Mr Musgrove was, in a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when



<P>they reached the cottage, they were evidently in want, first,



<P>of being listened to anew on this subject, and afterwards,



<P>of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth, repeating his name



<P>so often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it

might,



<P>that it probably would, turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth



<P>whom they recollected meeting, once or twice, after their coming back



<P>from Clifton--a very fine young man--but they could not say whether



<P>it was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to Anne's nerves.



<P>She found, however, that it was one to which she must inure herself.



<P>Since he actually was expected in the country, she must teach herself



<P>to be insensible on such points.&nbsp; And not only did it appear that



<P>he was expected, and speedily, but the Musgroves, in their warm gratitude



<P>for the kindness he had shewn poor Dick, and very high respect



<P>for his character, stamped as it was by poor Dick's having been



<P>six months under his care, and mentioning him in strong,



<P>though not perfectly well-spelt praise, as "a fine dashing felow,



<P>only two perticular about the schoolmaster," were bent on



<P>introducing themselves, and seeking his acquaintance, as soon as



<P>they could hear of his arrival.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The resolution of doing so helped to form the comfort of their evening.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Anne and Henrietta, finding themselves the earliest of the party



<P>the next morning, agreed to stroll down to the sea before breakfast.



<P>They went to the sands, to watch the flowing of the tide,



<P>which a fine south-easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur



<P>which so flat a shore admitted.&nbsp; They praised the morning;



<P>gloried in the sea; sympathized in the delight of the fresh-feeling



<P>breeze--and were silent; till Henrietta suddenly began again with--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! yes,--I am quite convinced that, with very few exceptions,



<P>the sea-air always does good.&nbsp; There can be no doubt of its having

been



<P>of the greatest service to Dr Shirley, after his illness,



<P>last spring twelve-month.&nbsp; He declares himself, that coming to

Lyme



<P>for a month, did him more good than all the medicine he took;



<P>and, that being by the sea, always makes him feel young again.



<P>Now, I cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live



<P>entirely by the sea.&nbsp; I do think he had better leave Uppercross

entirely,



<P>and fix at Lyme.&nbsp; Do not you, Anne?&nbsp; Do not you agree with

me,



<P>that it is the best thing he could do, both for himself and Mrs Shirley?



<P>She has cousins here, you know, and many acquaintance, which would



<P>make it cheerful for her, and I am sure she would be glad



<P>to get to a place where she could have medical attendance at hand,



<P>in case of his having another seizure.&nbsp; Indeed I think it quite

melancholy



<P>to have such excellent people as Dr and Mrs Shirley, who have been



<P>doing good all their lives, wearing out their last days in a place



<P>like Uppercross, where, excepting our family, they seem shut out



<P>from all the world.&nbsp; I wish his friends would propose it to him.



<P>I really think they ought.&nbsp; And, as to procuring a dispensation,



<P>there could be no difficulty at his time of life, and with his character.



<P>My only doubt is, whether anything could persuade him to leave his parish.



<P>He is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions; over-scrupulous



<P>I must say.&nbsp; Do not you think, Anne, it is being over-scrupulous?



<P>Do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience,



<P>when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties,



<P>which may be just as well performed by another person?&nbsp; And at

Lyme too,



<P>only seventeen miles off, he would be near enough to hear,



<P>if people thought there was anything to complain of."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech,



<P>and entered into the subject, as ready to do good by entering into



<P>the feelings of a young lady as of a young man, though here it was good



<P>of a lower standard, for what could be offered but general acquiescence?



<P>She said all that was reasonable and proper on the business;



<P>felt the claims of Dr Shirley to repose as she ought; saw how very



<P>desirable it was that he should have some active, respectable young

man,



<P>as a resident curate, and was even courteous enough to hint at



<P>the advantage of such resident curate's being married.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wish," said Henrietta, very well pleased with her companion,



<P>"I wish Lady Russell lived at Uppercross, and were intimate



<P>with Dr Shirley.&nbsp; I have always heard of Lady Russell as a woman

of



<P>the greatest influence with everybody!&nbsp; I always look upon her

as able



<P>to persuade a person to anything!&nbsp; I am afraid of her, as I have



<P>told you before, quite afraid of her, because she is so very clever;



<P>but I respect her amazingly, and wish we had such a neighbour



<P>at Uppercross."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne was amused by Henrietta's manner of being grateful,



<P>and amused also that the course of events and the new interests



<P>of Henrietta's views should have placed her friend at all in favour



<P>with any of the Musgrove family; she had only time, however,



<P>for a general answer, and a wish that such another woman



<P>were at Uppercross, before all subjects suddenly ceased,



<P>on seeing Louisa and Captain Wentworth coming towards them.



<P>They came also for a stroll till breakfast was likely to be ready;



<P>but Louisa recollecting, immediately afterwards that she had something



<P>to procure at a shop, invited them all to go back with her into the

town.



<P>They were all at her disposal.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When they came to the steps, leading upwards from the beach, a gentleman,



<P>at the same moment preparing to come down, politely drew back,



<P>and stopped to give them way.&nbsp; They ascended and passed him;



<P>and as they passed, Anne's face caught his eye, and he looked at her



<P>with a degree of earnest admiration, which she could not be insensible

of.



<P>She was looking remarkably well; her very regular, very pretty features,



<P>having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind



<P>which had been blowing on her complexion, and by the animation of eye



<P>which it had also produced.&nbsp; It was evident that the gentleman,



<P>(completely a gentleman in manner) admired her exceedingly.



<P>Captain Wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which



<P>shewed his noticing of it.&nbsp; He gave her a momentary glance,



<P>a glance of brightness, which seemed to say, "That man is struck with

you,



<P>and even I, at this moment, see something like Anne Elliot again."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After attending Louisa through her business, and loitering about



<P>a little longer, they returned to the inn; and Anne, in passing afterwards



<P>quickly from her own chamber to their dining-room, had nearly run against



<P>the very same gentleman, as he came out of an adjoining apartment.



<P>She had before conjectured him to be a stranger like themselves,



<P>and determined that a well-looking groom, who was strolling about



<P>near the two inns as they came back, should be his servant.



<P>Both master and man being in mourning assisted the idea.



<P>It was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves;



<P>and this second meeting, short as it was, also proved again



<P>by the gentleman's looks, that he thought hers very lovely,



<P>and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies, that he was



<P>a man of exceedingly good manners.&nbsp; He seemed about thirty,



<P>and though not handsome, had an agreeable person.&nbsp; Anne felt that



<P>she should like to know who he was.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They had nearly done breakfast, when the sound of a carriage,



<P>(almost the first they had heard since entering Lyme) drew half the

party



<P>to the window.&nbsp; It was a gentleman's carriage, a curricle,



<P>but only coming round from the stable-yard to the front door;



<P>somebody must be going away.&nbsp; It was driven by a servant in mourning.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The word curricle made Charles Musgrove jump up that he might



<P>compare it with his own; the servant in mourning roused Anne's curiosity,



<P>and the whole six were collected to look, by the time the owner



<P>of the curricle was to be seen issuing from the door amidst the bows



<P>and civilities of the household, and taking his seat, to drive off.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah!" cried Captain Wentworth, instantly, and with half a glance at

Anne,



<P>"it is the very man we passed."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Miss Musgroves agreed to it; and having all kindly watched him



<P>as far up the hill as they could, they returned to the breakfast table.



<P>The waiter came into the room soon afterwards.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Pray," said Captain Wentworth, immediately, "can you tell us the name



<P>of the gentleman who is just gone away?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, Sir, a Mr Elliot, a gentleman of large fortune, came in last night



<P>from Sidmouth.&nbsp; Dare say you heard the carriage, sir, while you

were



<P>at dinner; and going on now for Crewkherne, in his way to Bath



<P>and London."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Elliot!"&nbsp; Many had looked on each other, and many had repeated

the name,



<P>before all this had been got through, even by the smart rapidity



<P>of a waiter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Bless me!" cried Mary; "it must be our cousin; it must be our Mr Elliot,



<P>it must, indeed!&nbsp; Charles, Anne, must not it?&nbsp; In mourning,

you see,



<P>just as our Mr Elliot must be.&nbsp; How very extraordinary!



<P>In the very same inn with us!&nbsp; Anne, must not it be our Mr Elliot?



<P>my father's next heir?&nbsp; Pray sir," turning to the waiter,



<P>"did not you hear, did not his servant say whether he belonged



<P>to the Kellynch family?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, ma'am, he did not mention no particular family; but he said



<P>his master was a very rich gentleman, and would be a baronight some

day."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There! you see!" cried Mary in an ecstasy, "just as I said!



<P>Heir to Sir Walter Elliot!&nbsp; I was sure that would come out,



<P>if it was so.&nbsp; Depend upon it, that is a circumstance which his

servants



<P>take care to publish, wherever he goes.&nbsp; But, Anne, only conceive



<P>how extraordinary!&nbsp; I wish I had looked at him more.&nbsp; I wish

we had



<P>been aware in time, who it was, that he might have been introduced to

us.



<P>What a pity that we should not have been introduced to each other!



<P>Do you think he had the Elliot countenance?&nbsp; I hardly looked at

him,



<P>I was looking at the horses; but I think he had something



<P>of the Elliot countenance, I wonder the arms did not strike me!



<P>Oh! the great-coat was hanging over the panel, and hid the arms,



<P>so it did; otherwise, I am sure, I should have observed them,



<P>and the livery too; if the servant had not been in mourning,



<P>one should have known him by the livery."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Putting all these very extraordinary circumstances together,"



<P>said Captain Wentworth, "we must consider it to be the arrangement



<P>of Providence, that you should not be introduced to your cousin."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When she could command Mary's attention, Anne quietly tried



<P>to convince her that their father and Mr Elliot had not, for many years,



<P>been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction



<P>at all desirable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At the same time, however, it was a secret gratification to herself



<P>to have seen her cousin, and to know that the future owner of Kellynch



<P>was undoubtedly a gentleman, and had an air of good sense.



<P>She would not, upon any account, mention her having met with him



<P>the second time; luckily Mary did not much attend to their having



<P>passed close by him in their earlier walk, but she would have felt



<P>quite ill-used by Anne's having actually run against him in the passage,



<P>and received his very polite excuses, while she had never been



<P>near him at all; no, that cousinly little interview must remain



<P>a perfect secret.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Of course," said Mary, "you will mention our seeing Mr Elliot,



<P>the next time you write to Bath.&nbsp; I think my father certainly



<P>ought to hear of it; do mention all about him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne avoided a direct reply, but it was just the circumstance



<P>which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated,



<P>but as what ought to be suppressed.&nbsp; The offence which had been

given



<P>her father, many years back, she knew; Elizabeth's particular share

in it



<P>she suspected; and that Mr Elliot's idea always produced irritation

in both



<P>was beyond a doubt.&nbsp; Mary never wrote to Bath herself; all the

toil



<P>of keeping up a slow and unsatisfactory correspondence with Elizabeth



<P>fell on Anne.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Breakfast had not been long over, when they were joined by Captain



<P>and Mrs Harville and Captain Benwick; with whom they had appointed



<P>to take their last walk about Lyme.&nbsp; They ought to be setting off



<P>for Uppercross by one, and in the mean while were to be all together,



<P>and out of doors as long as they could.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne found Captain Benwick getting near her, as soon as they were all



<P>fairly in the street.&nbsp; Their conversation the preceding evening



<P>did not disincline him to seek her again; and they walked together



<P>some time, talking as before of Mr Scott and Lord Byron,



<P>and still as unable as before, and as unable as any other two readers,



<P>to think exactly alike of the merits of either, till something



<P>occasioned an almost general change amongst their party, and instead

of



<P>Captain Benwick, she had Captain Harville by her side.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Miss Elliot," said he, speaking rather low, "you have done a good deed



<P>in making that poor fellow talk so much.&nbsp; I wish he could have



<P>such company oftener.&nbsp; It is bad for him, I know, to be shut up

as he is;



<P>but what can we do?&nbsp; We cannot part."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No," said Anne, "that I can easily believe to be impossible;



<P>but in time, perhaps--we know what time does in every case of affliction,



<P>and you must remember, Captain Harville, that your friend



<P>may yet be called a young mourner--only last summer, I understand."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ay, true enough," (with a deep sigh) "only June."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And not known to him, perhaps, so soon."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not till the first week of August, when he came home from the Cape,



<P>just made into the Grappler.&nbsp; I was at Plymouth dreading to hear

of him;



<P>he sent in letters, but the Grappler was under orders for Portsmouth.



<P>There the news must follow him, but who was to tell it? not I.



<P>I would as soon have been run up to the yard-arm.&nbsp; Nobody could

do it,



<P>but that good fellow" (pointing to Captain Wentworth.)&nbsp; "The Laconia



<P>had come into Plymouth the week before; no danger of her



<P>being sent to sea again.&nbsp; He stood his chance for the rest;



<P>wrote up for leave of absence, but without waiting the return,



<P>travelled night and day till he got to Portsmouth, rowed off



<P>to the Grappler that instant, and never left the poor fellow for a week.



<P>That's what he did, and nobody else could have saved poor James.



<P>You may think, Miss Elliot, whether he is dear to us!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne did think on the question with perfect decision, and said as much



<P>in reply as her own feeling could accomplish, or as his seemed



<P>able to bear, for he was too much affected to renew the subject,



<P>and when he spoke again, it was of something totally different.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs Harville's giving it as her opinion that her husband would have



<P>quite walking enough by the time he reached home, determined the direction



<P>of all the party in what was to be their last walk; they would



<P>accompany them to their door, and then return and set off themselves.



<P>By all their calculations there was just time for this; but as they

drew



<P>near the Cobb, there was such a general wish to walk along it once more,



<P>all were so inclined, and Louisa soon grew so determined,



<P>that the difference of a quarter of an hour, it was found,



<P>would be no difference at all; so with all the kind leave-taking,



<P>and all the kind interchange of invitations and promises which



<P>may be imagined, they parted from Captain and Mrs Harville



<P>at their own door, and still accompanied by Captain Benwick,



<P>who seemed to cling to them to the last, proceeded to make



<P>the proper adieus to the Cobb.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne found Captain Benwick again drawing near her.&nbsp; Lord Byron's



<P>"dark blue seas" could not fail of being brought forward by



<P>their present view, and she gladly gave him all her attention as long

as



<P>attention was possible.&nbsp; It was soon drawn, perforce another way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant



<P>for the ladies, and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower,



<P>and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep

flight,



<P>excepting Louisa; she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth.



<P>In all their walks, he had had to jump her from the stiles;



<P>the sensation was delightful to her.&nbsp; The hardness of the pavement



<P>for her feet, made him less willing upon the present occasion;



<P>he did it, however.&nbsp; She was safely down, and instantly,



<P>to show her enjoyment, ran up the steps to be jumped down again.



<P>He advised her against it, thought the jar too great; but no,



<P>he reasoned and talked in vain, she smiled and said, "I am determined



<P>I will:" he put out his hands; she was too precipitate by half a second,



<P>she fell on the pavement on the Lower Cobb, and was taken up lifeless!



<P>There was no wound, no blood, no visible bruise; but her eyes were closed,



<P>she breathed not, her face was like death.&nbsp; The horror of the moment



<P>to all who stood around!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Captain Wentworth, who had caught her up, knelt with her in his arms,



<P>looking on her with a face as pallid as her own, in an agony of silence.



<P>"She is dead! she is dead!" screamed Mary, catching hold of her



<P>husband, and contributing with his own horror to make him immoveable;



<P>and in another moment, Henrietta, sinking under the conviction, lost



<P>her senses too, and would have fallen on the steps, but for Captain



<P>Benwick and Anne, who caught and supported her between them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Is there no one to help me?" were the first words which



<P>burst from Captain Wentworth, in a tone of despair, and as if



<P>all his own strength were gone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Go to him, go to him," cried Anne, "for heaven's sake go to him.



<P>I can support her myself.&nbsp; Leave me, and go to him.&nbsp; Rub her

hands,



<P>rub her temples; here are salts; take them, take them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Captain Benwick obeyed, and Charles at the same moment,



<P>disengaging himself from his wife, they were both with him;



<P>and Louisa was raised up and supported more firmly between them,



<P>and everything was done that Anne had prompted, but in vain;



<P>while Captain Wentworth, staggering against the wall for his support,



<P>exclaimed in the bitterest agony--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh God! her father and mother!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A surgeon!" said Anne.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He caught the word; it seemed to rouse him at once, and saying only--



<P>"True, true, a surgeon this instant," was darting away,



<P>when Anne eagerly suggested--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Captain Benwick, would not it be better for Captain Benwick?



<P>He knows where a surgeon is to be found."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Every one capable of thinking felt the advantage of the idea,



<P>and in a moment (it was all done in rapid moments) Captain Benwick had



<P>resigned the poor corpse-like&nbsp; figure entirely to the brother's

care,



<P>and was off for the town with the utmost rapidity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As to the wretched party left behind, it could scarcely be said



<P>which of the three, who were completely rational, was suffering most:



<P>Captain Wentworth, Anne, or Charles, who, really a very affectionate



<P>brother, hung over Louisa with sobs of grief, and could only turn his

eyes



<P>from one sister, to see the other in a state as insensible,



<P>or to witness the hysterical agitations of his wife, calling on him



<P>for help which he could not give.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne, attending with all the strength and zeal, and thought,



<P>which instinct supplied, to Henrietta, still tried, at intervals,



<P>to suggest comfort to the others, tried to quiet Mary, to animate Charles,



<P>to assuage the feelings of Captain Wentworth.&nbsp; Both seemed to look

to her



<P>for directions.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Anne, Anne," cried Charles, "What is to be done next?



<P>What, in heaven's name, is to be done next?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Captain Wentworth's eyes were also turned towards her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Had not she better be carried to the inn?&nbsp; Yes, I am sure:



<P>carry her gently to the inn."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, yes, to the inn," repeated Captain Wentworth, comparatively



<P>collected, and eager to be doing something.&nbsp; "I will carry her

myself.



<P>Musgrove, take care of the others."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>By this time the report of the accident had spread among the workmen



<P>and boatmen about the Cobb, and many were collected near them,



<P>to be useful if wanted, at any rate, to enjoy the sight of



<P>a dead young lady, nay, two dead young ladies, for it proved twice as

fine



<P>as the first report.&nbsp; To some of the best-looking of these good

people



<P>Henrietta was consigned, for, though partially revived,



<P>she was quite helpless; and in this manner, Anne walking by her side,



<P>and Charles attending to his wife, they set forward, treading back



<P>with feelings unutterable, the ground, which so lately, so very lately,



<P>and so light of heart, they had passed along.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They were not off the Cobb, before the Harvilles met them.



<P>Captain Benwick had been seen flying by their house, with a countenance



<P>which showed something to be wrong; and they had set off immediately,



<P>informed and directed as they passed, towards the spot.



<P>Shocked as Captain Harville was, he brought senses and nerves



<P>that could be instantly useful; and a look between him and his wife



<P>decided what was to be done.&nbsp; She must be taken to their house;



<P>all must go to their house; and await the surgeon's arrival there.



<P>They would not listen to scruples:&nbsp; he was obeyed; they were all



<P>beneath his roof; and while Louisa, under Mrs Harville's direction,



<P>was conveyed up stairs, and given possession of her own bed,



<P>assistance, cordials, restoratives were supplied by her husband



<P>to all who needed them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Louisa had once opened her eyes, but soon closed them again,



<P>without apparent consciousness.&nbsp; This had been a proof of life,



<P>however, of service to her sister; and Henrietta, though perfectly



<P>incapable of being in the same room with Louisa, was kept,



<P>by the agitation of hope and fear, from a return of her own insensibility.



<P>Mary, too, was growing calmer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The surgeon was with them almost before it had seemed possible.



<P>They were sick with horror, while he examined; but he was not hopeless.



<P>The head had received a severe contusion, but he had seen greater injuries



<P>recovered from:&nbsp; he was by no means hopeless; he spoke cheerfully.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That he did not regard it as a desperate case, that he did not say



<P>a few hours must end it, was at first felt, beyond the hope of most;



<P>and the ecstasy of such a reprieve, the rejoicing, deep and silent,



<P>after a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered,



<P>may be conceived.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The tone, the look, with which "Thank God!" was uttered



<P>by Captain Wentworth, Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her;



<P>nor the sight of him afterwards, as he sat near a table, leaning over

it



<P>with folded arms and face concealed, as if overpowered by



<P>the various feelings of his soul, and trying by prayer and reflection



<P>to calm them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Louisa's limbs had escaped.&nbsp; There was no injury but to the head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be

done,



<P>as to their general situation.&nbsp; They were now able to speak to

each other



<P>and consult.&nbsp; That Louisa must remain where she was, however distressing



<P>to her friends to be involving the Harvilles in such trouble,



<P>did not admit a doubt.&nbsp; Her removal was impossible.&nbsp; The Harvilles



<P>silenced all scruples; and, as much as they could, all gratitude.



<P>They had looked forward and arranged everything before the others



<P>began to reflect.&nbsp; Captain Benwick must give up his room to them,



<P>and get another bed elsewhere; and the whole was settled.



<P>They were only concerned that the house could accommodate no more;



<P>and yet perhaps, by "putting the children away in the maid's room,



<P>or swinging a cot somewhere," they could hardly bear to think of not



<P>finding room for two or three besides, supposing they might wish to

stay;



<P>though, with regard to any attendance on Miss Musgrove, there need not

be



<P>the least uneasiness in leaving her to Mrs Harville's care entirely.



<P>Mrs Harville was a very experienced nurse, and her nursery-maid,



<P>who had lived with her long, and gone about with her everywhere,



<P>was just such another.&nbsp; Between these two, she could want



<P>no possible attendance by day or night.&nbsp; And all this was said



<P>with a truth and sincerity of feeling irresistible.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Charles, Henrietta, and Captain Wentworth were the three in consultation,



<P>and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and

terror.



<P>"Uppercross, the necessity of some one's going to Uppercross;



<P>the news to be conveyed; how it could be broken to Mr and Mrs Musgrove;



<P>the lateness of the morning; an hour already gone since they



<P>ought to have been off; the impossibility of being in tolerable time."



<P>At first, they were capable of nothing more to the purpose



<P>than such exclamations; but, after a while, Captain Wentworth,



<P>exerting himself, said--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We must be decided, and without the loss of another minute.



<P>Every minute is valuable.&nbsp; Some one must resolve on being off



<P>for Uppercross instantly.&nbsp; Musgrove, either you or I must go."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Charles agreed, but declared his resolution of not going away.



<P>He would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville;



<P>but as to leaving his sister in such a state, he neither ought, nor

would.



<P>So far it was decided; and Henrietta at first declared the same.



<P>She, however, was soon persuaded to think differently.&nbsp; The usefulness



<P>of her staying!&nbsp; She who had not been able to remain in Louisa's

room,



<P>or to look at her, without sufferings which made her worse than helpless!



<P>She was forced to acknowledge that she could do no good,



<P>yet was still unwilling to be away, till, touched by the thought



<P>of her father and mother, she gave it up; she consented,



<P>she was anxious to be at home.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The plan had reached this point, when Anne, coming quietly



<P>down from Louisa's room, could not but hear what followed,



<P>for the parlour door was open.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then it is settled, Musgrove," cried Captain Wentworth,



<P>"that you stay, and that I take care of your sister home.



<P>But as to the rest, as to the others, if one stays to assist Mrs Harville,



<P>I think it need be only one.&nbsp; Mrs Charles Musgrove will, of course,



<P>wish to get back to her children; but if Anne will stay, no one so proper,



<P>so capable as Anne."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She paused a moment to recover from the emotion of hearing herself



<P>so spoken of.&nbsp; The other two warmly agreed with what he said,



<P>and she then appeared.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You will stay, I am sure; you will stay and nurse her;" cried he,



<P>turning to her and speaking with a glow, and yet a gentleness,



<P>which seemed almost restoring the past.&nbsp; She coloured deeply,



<P>and he recollected himself and moved away.&nbsp; She expressed herself



<P>most willing, ready, happy to remain.&nbsp; "It was what she had been



<P>thinking of, and wishing to be allowed to do.&nbsp; A bed on the floor



<P>in Louisa's room would be sufficient for her, if Mrs Harville



<P>would but think so."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One thing more, and all seemed arranged.&nbsp; Though it was rather

desirable



<P>that Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some



<P>share of delay; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses



<P>to take them back, would be a dreadful extension of suspense;



<P>and Captain Wentworth proposed, and Charles Musgrove agreed,



<P>that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn,



<P>and leave Mr Musgrove's carriage and horses to be sent home



<P>the next morning early, when there would be the farther advantage



<P>of sending an account of Louisa's night.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Captain Wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part,



<P>and to be soon followed by the two ladies.&nbsp; When the plan was



<P>made known to Mary, however, there was an end of all peace in it.



<P>She was so wretched and so vehement, complained so much of injustice



<P>in being expected to go away instead of Anne; Anne, who was



<P>nothing to Louisa, while she was her sister, and had the best right



<P>to stay in Henrietta's stead!&nbsp; Why was not she to be as useful

as Anne?



<P>And to go home without Charles, too, without her husband!



<P>No, it was too unkind.&nbsp; And in short, she said more than her husband



<P>could long withstand, and as none of the others could oppose



<P>when he gave way, there was no help for it; the change of Mary for Anne



<P>was inevitable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous



<P>and ill-judging claims of Mary; but so it must be, and they set off



<P>for the town, Charles taking care of his sister, and Captain Benwick



<P>attending to her.&nbsp; She gave a moment's recollection, as they hurried

along,



<P>to the little circumstances which the same spots had witnessed



<P>earlier in the morning.&nbsp; There she had listened to Henrietta's

schemes



<P>for Dr Shirley's leaving Uppercross; farther on, she had



<P>first seen Mr Elliot; a moment seemed all that could now be given



<P>to any one but Louisa, or those who were wrapt up in her welfare.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Captain Benwick was most considerately attentive to her; and,



<P>united as they all seemed by the distress of the day, she felt



<P>an increasing degree of good-will towards him, and a pleasure even



<P>in thinking that it might, perhaps, be the occasion of continuing



<P>their acquaintance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Captain Wentworth was on the watch for them, and a chaise and four in

waiting,



<P>stationed for their convenience in the lowest part of the street;



<P>but his evident surprise and vexation at the substitution of one sister



<P>for the other, the change in his countenance, the astonishment,



<P>the expressions begun and suppressed, with which Charles was listened

to,



<P>made but a mortifying reception of Anne; or must at least convince her



<P>that she was valued only as she could be useful to Louisa.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She endeavoured to be composed, and to be just.&nbsp; Without emulating



<P>the feelings of an Emma towards her Henry, she would have



<P>attended on Louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard,



<P>for his sake; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust



<P>as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the mean while she was in the carriage.&nbsp; He had handed them

both in,



<P>and placed himself between them; and in this manner, under these



<P>circumstances, full of astonishment and emotion to Anne, she quitted

Lyme.



<P>How the long stage would pass; how it was to affect their manners;



<P>what was to be their sort of intercourse, she could not foresee.



<P>It was all quite natural, however.&nbsp; He was devoted to Henrietta;



<P>always turning towards her; and when he spoke at all, always with the

view



<P>of supporting her hopes and raising her spirits.&nbsp; In general,



<P>his voice and manner were studiously calm.&nbsp; To spare Henrietta



<P>from agitation seemed the governing principle.&nbsp; Once only,



<P>when she had been grieving over the last ill-judged, ill-fated



<P>walk to the Cobb, bitterly lamenting that it ever had been thought of,



<P>he burst forth, as if wholly overcome--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't talk of it, don't talk of it," he cried.&nbsp; "Oh God! that

I had



<P>not given way to her at the fatal moment!&nbsp; Had I done as I ought!



<P>But so eager and so resolute! Dear, sweet Louisa!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne wondered whether it ever occurred to him now, to question the justness



<P>of his own previous opinion as to the universal felicity and advantage



<P>of firmness of character; and whether it might not strike him that,



<P>like all other qualities of the mind, it should have its proportions



<P>and limits.&nbsp; She thought it could scarcely escape him to feel



<P>that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness



<P>as a very resolute character.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They got on fast.&nbsp; Anne was astonished to recognise the same hills



<P>and the same objects so soon.&nbsp; Their actual speed, heightened by



<P>some dread of the conclusion, made the road appear but half as long



<P>as on the day before.&nbsp; It was growing quite dusk, however,



<P>before they were in the neighbourhood of Uppercross, and there had been



<P>total silence among them for some time, Henrietta leaning back



<P>in the corner, with a shawl over her face, giving the hope of her



<P>having cried herself to sleep; when, as they were going up their last

hill,



<P>Anne found herself all at once addressed by Captain Wentworth.



<P>In a low, cautious voice, he said: --

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have been considering what we had best do.&nbsp; She must not



<P>appear at first.&nbsp; She could not stand it.&nbsp; I have been thinking

whether



<P>you had not better remain in the carriage with her, while I go in



<P>and break it to Mr and Mrs Musgrove.&nbsp; Do you think this is a good

plan?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She did:&nbsp; he was satisfied, and said no more.&nbsp; But the remembrance



<P>of the appeal remained a pleasure to her, as a proof of friendship,



<P>and of deference for her judgement, a great pleasure; and when it became



<P>a sort of parting proof, its value did not lessen.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the distressing communication at Uppercross was over,



<P>and he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be

hoped,



<P>and the daughter all the better for being with them, he announced



<P>his intention of returning in the same carriage to Lyme;



<P>and when the horses were baited, he was off.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>One day only had passed since Anne's conversation with Mrs Smith;



<P>but a keener interest had succeeded, and she was now so little touched



<P>by Mr Elliot's conduct, except by its effects in one quarter,



<P>that it became a matter of course the next morning, still to defer



<P>her explanatory visit in Rivers Street.&nbsp; She had promised to be



<P>with the Musgroves from breakfast to dinner.&nbsp; Her faith was plighted,



<P>and Mr Elliot's character, like the Sultaness Scheherazade's head,



<P>must live another day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She could not keep her appointment punctually, however;



<P>the weather was unfavourable, and she had grieved over the rain



<P>on her friends' account, and felt it very much on her own,



<P>before she was able to attempt the walk.&nbsp; When she reached the

White Hart,



<P>and made her way to the proper apartment, she found herself



<P>neither arriving quite in time, nor the first to arrive.



<P>The party before her were, Mrs Musgrove, talking to Mrs Croft,



<P>and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth; and she immediately heard



<P>that Mary and Henrietta, too impatient to wait, had gone out the moment



<P>it had cleared, but would be back again soon, and that the strictest



<P>injunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to keep her there



<P>till they returned.&nbsp; She had only to submit, sit down,



<P>be outwardly composed, and feel herself plunged at once



<P>in all the agitations which she had merely laid her account of



<P>tasting a little before the morning closed.&nbsp; There was no delay,



<P>no waste of time.&nbsp; She was deep in the happiness of such misery,



<P>or the misery of such happiness, instantly.&nbsp; Two minutes after



<P>her entering the room, Captain Wentworth said--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We will write the letter we were talking of, Harville, now,



<P>if you will give me materials."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Materials were at hand, on a separate table; he went to it,



<P>and nearly turning his back to them all, was engrossed by writing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her eldest



<P>daughter's engagement, and just in that inconvenient tone of voice



<P>which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper.



<P>Anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation, and yet,



<P>as Captain Harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk,



<P>she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars; such as,



<P>"how Mr Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again



<P>to talk it over; what my brother Hayter had said one day,



<P>and what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next, and what had occurred



<P>to my sister Hayter, and what the young people had wished, and what



<P>I said at first I never could consent to, but was afterwards persuaded



<P>to think might do very well," and a great deal in the same style



<P>of open-hearted communication:&nbsp; minutiae which, even with every

advantage



<P>of taste and delicacy, which good Mrs Musgrove could not give,



<P>could be properly interesting only to the principals.&nbsp; Mrs Croft



<P>was attending with great good-humour, and whenever she spoke at all,



<P>it was very sensibly.&nbsp; Anne hoped the gentlemen might each be



<P>too much self-occupied to hear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And so, ma'am, all these thing considered," said Mrs Musgrove,



<P>in her powerful whisper, "though we could have wished it different,



<P>yet, altogether, we did not think it fair to stand out any longer,



<P>for Charles Hayter was quite wild about it, and Henrietta was



<P>pretty near as bad; and so we thought they had better marry at once,



<P>and make the best of it, as many others have done before them.



<P>At any rate, said I, it will be better than a long engagement."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That is precisely what I was going to observe," cried Mrs Croft.



<P>"I would rather have young people settle on a small income at once,



<P>and have to struggle with a few difficulties together, than be



<P>involved in a long engagement.&nbsp; I always think that no mutual--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! dear Mrs Croft," cried Mrs Musgrove, unable to let her



<P>finish her speech, "there is nothing I so abominate for young people



<P>as a long engagement.&nbsp; It is what I always protested against



<P>for my children.&nbsp; It is all very well, I used to say, for young

people



<P>to be engaged, if there is a certainty of their being able to marry



<P>in six months, or even in twelve; but a long engagement--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, dear ma'am," said Mrs Croft, "or an uncertain engagement,



<P>an engagement which may be long.&nbsp; To begin without knowing



<P>that at such a time there will be the means of marrying,



<P>I hold to be very unsafe and unwise, and what I think all parents



<P>should prevent as far as they can."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne found an unexpected interest here.&nbsp; She felt its application



<P>to herself, felt it in a nervous thrill all over her; and at the same



<P>moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table,



<P>Captain Wentworth's pen ceased to move, his head was raised, pausing,



<P>listening, and he turned round the next instant to give a look,



<P>one quick, conscious look at her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The two ladies continued to talk, to re-urge the same admitted truths,



<P>and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of



<P>a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation,



<P>but Anne heard nothing distinctly; it was only a buzz of words in her

ear,



<P>her mind was in confusion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Captain Harville, who had in truth been hearing none of it,



<P>now left his seat, and moved to a window, and Anne seeming to watch

him,



<P>though it was from thorough absence of mind, became gradually sensible



<P>that he was inviting her to join him where he stood.&nbsp; He looked

at her



<P>with a smile, and a little motion of the head, which expressed,



<P>"Come to me, I have something to say;" and the unaffected,



<P>easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance



<P>than he really was, strongly enforced the invitation.&nbsp; She roused

herself



<P>and went to him.&nbsp; The window at which he stood was at the other

end



<P>of the room from where the two ladies were sitting, and though nearer



<P>to Captain Wentworth's table, not very near.&nbsp; As she joined him,



<P>Captain Harville's countenance re-assumed the serious, thoughtful



<P>expression which seemed its natural character.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Look here," said he, unfolding a parcel in his hand, and displaying



<P>a small miniature painting, "do you know who that is?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Certainly:&nbsp; Captain Benwick."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, and you may guess who it is for.&nbsp; But," (in a deep tone,)



<P>"it was not done for her.&nbsp; Miss Elliot, do you remember our



<P>walking together at Lyme, and grieving for him?&nbsp; I little thought

then--



<P>but no matter.&nbsp; This was drawn at the Cape.&nbsp; He met with



<P>a clever young German artist at the Cape, and in compliance with a promise



<P>to my poor sister, sat to him, and was bringing it home for her;



<P>and I have now the charge of getting it properly set for another!



<P>It was a commission to me!&nbsp; But who else was there to employ?



<P>I hope I can allow for him.&nbsp; I am not sorry, indeed, to make it



<P>over to another.&nbsp; He undertakes it;" (looking towards Captain Wentworth,)



<P>"he is writing about it now."&nbsp; And with a quivering lip he wound

up



<P>the whole by adding, "Poor Fanny! she would not have forgotten him so

soon!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No," replied Anne, in a low, feeling voice. "That I can easily believe."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It was not in her nature.&nbsp; She doted on him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Captain Harville smiled, as much as to say, "Do you claim that



<P>for your sex?" and she answered the question, smiling also,



<P>"Yes.&nbsp; We certainly do not forget you as soon as you forget us.



<P>It is, perhaps, our fate rather than our merit.&nbsp; We cannot help

ourselves.



<P>We live at home, quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us.



<P>You are forced on exertion.&nbsp; You have always a profession, pursuits,



<P>business of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately,



<P>and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men



<P>(which, however, I do not think I shall grant), it does not apply



<P>to Benwick.&nbsp; He has not been forced upon any exertion.&nbsp; The

peace



<P>turned him on shore at the very moment, and he has been living with

us,



<P>in our little family circle, ever since."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"True," said Anne, "very true; I did not recollect; but what shall



<P>we say now, Captain Harville?&nbsp; If the change be not from



<P>outward circumstances, it must be from within; it must be nature,



<P>man's nature, which has done the business for Captain Benwick."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, no, it is not man's nature.&nbsp; I will not allow it to be more



<P>man's nature than woman's to be inconstant and forget those they do

love,



<P>or have loved.&nbsp; I believe the reverse.&nbsp; I believe in a true

analogy



<P>between our bodily frames and our mental; and that as our bodies are



<P>the strongest, so are our feelings; capable of bearing most rough usage,



<P>and riding out the heaviest weather."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your feelings may be the strongest," replied Anne, "but the same spirit



<P>of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender.



<P>Man is more robust than woman, but he is not longer lived;



<P>which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments.



<P>Nay, it would be too hard upon you, if it were otherwise.



<P>You have difficulties, and privations, and dangers enough to struggle

with.



<P>You are always labouring and toiling, exposed to every risk and hardship.



<P>Your home, country, friends, all quitted.&nbsp; Neither time, nor health,



<P>nor life, to be called your own.&nbsp; It would be hard, indeed"



<P>(with a faltering voice), "if woman's feelings were to be



<P>added to all this."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We shall never agree upon this question," Captain Harville



<P>was beginning to say, when a slight noise called their attention



<P>to Captain Wentworth's hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room.



<P>It was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down; but Anne was



<P>startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed, and half inclined



<P>to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been



<P>occupied by them, striving to catch sounds, which yet she did not think



<P>he could have caught.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Have you finished your letter?" said Captain Harville.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not quite, a few lines more.&nbsp; I shall have done in five minutes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is no hurry on my side.&nbsp; I am only ready whenever you are.



<P>I am in very good anchorage here," (smiling at Anne,) "well supplied,



<P>and want for nothing.&nbsp; No hurry for a signal at all.&nbsp; Well,

Miss Elliot,"



<P>(lowering his voice,) "as I was saying we shall never agree,



<P>I suppose, upon this point.&nbsp; No man and woman, would, probably.



<P>But let me observe that all histories are against you--all stories,



<P>prose and verse.&nbsp; If I had such a memory as Benwick, I could bring

you



<P>fifty quotations in a moment on my side the argument, and I do not think



<P>I ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say



<P>upon woman's inconstancy.&nbsp; Songs and proverbs, all talk



<P>of woman's fickleness.&nbsp; But perhaps you will say, these were all



<P>written by men."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Perhaps I shall.&nbsp; Yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples



<P>in books.&nbsp; Men have had every advantage of us in telling their

own story.



<P>Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has



<P>been in their hands.&nbsp; I will not allow books to prove anything."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But how shall we prove anything?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We never shall.&nbsp; We never can expect to prove any thing upon such

a point.



<P>It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof.



<P>We each begin, probably, with a little bias towards our own sex;



<P>and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it



<P>which has occurred within our own circle; many of which circumstances



<P>(perhaps those very cases which strike us the most) may be precisely

such



<P>as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence,



<P>or in some respect saying what should not be said."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah!" cried Captain Harville, in a tone of strong feeling,



<P>"if I could but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he takes



<P>a last look at his wife and children, and watches the boat



<P>that he has sent them off in, as long as it is in sight,



<P>and then turns away and says, `God knows whether we ever meet again!'



<P>And then, if I could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does



<P>see them again; when, coming back after a twelvemonth's absence,



<P>perhaps, and obliged to put into another port, he calculates how soon



<P>it be possible to get them there, pretending to deceive himself,



<P>and saying, `They cannot be here till such a day,' but all the while



<P>hoping for them twelve hours sooner, and seeing them arrive at last,



<P>as if Heaven had given them wings, by many hours sooner still!



<P>If I could explain to you all this, and all that a man can bear and

do,



<P>and glories to do, for the sake of these treasures of his existence!



<P>I speak, you know, only of such men as have hearts!" pressing his own



<P>with emotion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh!" cried Anne eagerly, "I hope I do justice to all that is felt by

you,



<P>and by those who resemble you.&nbsp; God forbid that I should undervalue



<P>the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures!



<P>I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to suppose that true attachment



<P>and constancy were known only by woman.&nbsp; No, I believe you capable



<P>of everything great and good in your married lives.&nbsp; I believe

you equal



<P>to every important exertion, and to every domestic forbearance,



<P>so long as--if I may be allowed the expression--so long as you have



<P>an object.&nbsp; I mean while the woman you love lives, and lives for

you.



<P>All the privilege I claim for my own sex (it is not a very enviable

one;



<P>you need not covet it), is that of loving longest, when existence



<P>or when hope is gone."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She could not immediately have uttered another sentence; her heart



<P>was too full, her breath too much oppressed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are a good soul," cried Captain Harville, putting his hand



<P>on her arm, quite affectionately.&nbsp; "There is no quarreling with

you.



<P>And when I think of Benwick, my tongue is tied."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Their attention was called towards the others.&nbsp; Mrs Croft was taking

leave.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here, Frederick, you and I part company, I believe," said she.



<P>"I am going home, and you have an engagement with your friend.



<P>To-night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party,"



<P>(turning to Anne.)&nbsp; "We had your sister's card yesterday,



<P>and I understood Frederick had a card too, though I did not see it;



<P>and you are disengaged, Frederick, are you not, as well as ourselves?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Captain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste, and either



<P>could not or would not answer fully.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," said he, "very true; here we separate, but Harville and I



<P>shall soon be after you; that is, Harville, if you are ready,



<P>I am in half a minute.&nbsp; I know you will not be sorry to be off.



<P>I shall be at your service in half a minute."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs Croft left them, and Captain Wentworth, having sealed his letter



<P>with great rapidity, was indeed ready, and had even a hurried,



<P>agitated air, which shewed impatience to be gone.&nbsp; Anne know not

how



<P>to understand it.&nbsp; She had the kindest "Good morning, God bless

you!"



<P>from Captain Harville, but from him not a word, nor a look!



<P>He had passed out of the room without a look!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had only time, however, to move closer to the table where



<P>he had been writing, when footsteps were heard returning;



<P>the door opened, it was himself.&nbsp; He begged their pardon,



<P>but he had forgotten his gloves, and instantly crossing the room



<P>to the writing table, he drew out a letter from under the scattered

paper,



<P>placed it before Anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her



<P>for a time, and hastily collecting his gloves, was again out of the

room,



<P>almost before Mrs Musgrove was aware of his being in it:



<P>the work of an instant!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The revolution which one instant had made in Anne, was almost



<P>beyond expression.&nbsp; The letter, with a direction hardly legible,



<P>to "Miss A. E.--," was evidently the one which he had been folding



<P>so hastily.&nbsp; While supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick,



<P>he had been also addressing her!&nbsp; On the contents of that letter



<P>depended all which this world could do for her.&nbsp; Anything was possible,



<P>anything might be defied rather than suspense.&nbsp; Mrs Musgrove had



<P>little arrangements of her own at her own table; to their protection



<P>she must trust, and sinking into the chair which he had occupied,



<P>succeeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written,



<P>her eyes devoured the following words:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I can listen no longer in silence.&nbsp; I must speak to you by such

means



<P>as are within my reach.&nbsp; You pierce my soul.&nbsp; I am half agony,



<P>half hope.&nbsp; Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious

feelings



<P>are gone for ever.&nbsp; I offer myself to you again with a heart



<P>even more your own than when you almost broke it, eight years



<P>and a half ago.&nbsp; Dare not say that man forgets sooner than&nbsp;

woman,



<P>that his love has an earlier death.&nbsp; I have loved none but you.



<P>Unjust I may have been, weak and resentful I have been,



<P>but never inconstant.&nbsp; You alone have brought me to Bath.



<P>For you alone, I think and plan.&nbsp; Have you not seen this?



<P>Can you fail to have understood my wishes?&nbsp; I had not waited even



<P>these ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think you must

have



<P>penetrated mine.&nbsp; I can hardly write.&nbsp; I am every instant

hearing



<P>something which overpowers me.&nbsp; You sink your voice, but I can



<P>distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others.



<P>Too good, too excellent creature!&nbsp; You do us justice, indeed.



<P>You do believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men.



<P>Believe it to be most fervent, most undeviating, in F. W.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I must go, uncertain of my fate; but I shall return hither,



<P>or follow your party, as soon as possible.&nbsp; A word, a look,



<P>will be enough to decide whether I enter your father's house



<P>this evening or never."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Such a letter was not to be soon recovered from.&nbsp; Half and hour's

solitude



<P>and reflection might have tranquillized her; but the ten minutes only



<P>which now passed before she was interrupted, with all the restraints



<P>of her situation, could do nothing towards tranquillity.&nbsp; Every

moment



<P>rather brought fresh agitation.&nbsp; It was overpowering happiness.



<P>And before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation,



<P>Charles, Mary, and Henrietta all came in.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then



<P>an immediate struggle; but after a while she could do no more.



<P>She began not to understand a word they said, and was obliged



<P>to plead indisposition and excuse herself.&nbsp; They could then see



<P>that she looked very ill, were shocked and concerned, and would not



<P>stir without her for the world.&nbsp; This was dreadful.&nbsp; Would

they only



<P>have gone away, and left her in the quiet possession of that room



<P>it would have been her cure; but to have them all standing or



<P>waiting around her was distracting, and in desperation,



<P>she said she would go home.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"By all means, my dear," cried Mrs Musgrove, "go home directly,



<P>and take care of yourself, that you may be fit for the evening.



<P>I wish Sarah was here to doctor you, but I am no doctor myself.



<P>Charles, ring and order a chair.&nbsp; She must not walk."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But the chair would never do.&nbsp; Worse than all!&nbsp; To lose the

possibility



<P>of speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her quiet,



<P>solitary progress up the town (and she felt almost certain of meeting

him)



<P>could not be borne.&nbsp; The chair was earnestly protested against,



<P>and Mrs Musgrove, who thought only of one sort of illness,



<P>having assured herself with some anxiety, that there had been no fall



<P>in the case; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down,



<P>and got a blow on her head; that she was perfectly convinced of having



<P>had no fall; could part with her cheerfully, and depend on



<P>finding her better at night.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anxious to omit no possible precaution, Anne struggled, and said--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am afraid, ma'am, that it is not perfectly understood.



<P>Pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope



<P>to see your whole party this evening.&nbsp; I am afraid there had been



<P>some mistake; and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville



<P>and Captain Wentworth, that we hope to see them both."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! my dear, it is quite understood, I give you my word.



<P>Captain Harville has no thought but of going."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you think so?&nbsp; But I am afraid; and I should be so very sorry.



<P>Will you promise me to mention it, when you see them again?



<P>You will see them both this morning, I dare say.&nbsp; Do promise me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To be sure I will, if you wish it.&nbsp; Charles, if you see Captain

Harville



<P>anywhere, remember to give Miss Anne's message.&nbsp; But indeed, my

dear,



<P>you need not be uneasy.&nbsp; Captain Harville holds himself quite engaged,



<P>I'll answer for it; and Captain Wentworth the same, I dare say."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne could do no more; but her heart prophesied some mischance



<P>to damp the perfection of her felicity.&nbsp; It could not be very lasting,



<P>however.&nbsp; Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself,



<P>it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence



<P>by Captain Harville.&nbsp; Another momentary vexation occurred.



<P>Charles, in his real concern and good nature, would go home with her;



<P>there was no preventing him.&nbsp; This was almost cruel.&nbsp; But

she could not



<P>be long ungrateful; he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith's,



<P>to be of use to her; and she set off with him, with no feeling



<P>but gratitude apparent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They were on Union Street, when a quicker step behind, a something



<P>of familiar sound, gave her two moments' preparation for the sight



<P>of Captain Wentworth.&nbsp; He joined them; but, as if irresolute



<P>whether to join or to pass on, said nothing, only looked.



<P>Anne could command herself enough to receive that look,



<P>and not repulsively.&nbsp; The cheeks which had been pale now glowed,



<P>and the movements which had hesitated were decided.&nbsp; He walked

by her side.



<P>Presently, struck by a sudden thought, Charles said--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Captain Wentworth, which way are you going?&nbsp; Only to Gay Street,



<P>or farther up the town?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hardly know," replied Captain Wentworth, surprised.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Are you going as high as Belmont?&nbsp; Are you going near Camden Place?



<P>Because, if you are, I shall have no scruple in asking you



<P>to take my place, and give Anne your arm to her father's door.



<P>She is rather done for this morning, and must not go so far without

help,



<P>and I ought to be at that fellow's in the Market Place.



<P>He promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off;



<P>said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment,



<P>that I might see it; and if I do not turn back now, I have no chance.



<P>By his description, a good deal like the second size double-barrel of

mine,



<P>which you shot with one day round Winthrop."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There could not be an objection.&nbsp; There could be only the most



<P>proper alacrity, a most obliging compliance for public view;



<P>and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture.



<P>In half a minute Charles was at the bottom of Union Street again,



<P>and the other two proceeding together:&nbsp; and soon words enough had

passed



<P>between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet



<P>and retired gravel walk, where the power of conversation would make



<P>the present hour a blessing indeed, and prepare it for all



<P>the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future

lives



<P>could bestow.&nbsp; There they exchanged again those feelings



<P>and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything,



<P>but which had been followed by so many, many years of division



<P>and estrangement.&nbsp; There they returned again into the past,



<P>more exquisitely happy, perhaps, in their re-union, than when



<P>it had been first projected; more tender, more tried, more fixed



<P>in a knowledge of each other's character, truth, and attachment;



<P>more equal to act, more justified in acting.&nbsp; And there, as they

slowly



<P>paced the gradual ascent, heedless of every group around them,



<P>seeing neither sauntering politicians, bustling housekeepers,



<P>flirting girls, nor nursery-maids and children, they could indulge in



<P>those retrospections and acknowledgements, and especially in



<P>those explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment,



<P>which were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest.&nbsp; All the little



<P>variations of the last week were gone through; and of yesterday



<P>and today there could scarcely be an end.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had not mistaken him.&nbsp; Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been



<P>the retarding weight, the doubt, the torment.&nbsp; That had begun to

operate



<P>in the very hour of first meeting her in Bath; that had returned,



<P>after a short suspension, to ruin the concert; and that had influenced

him



<P>in everything he had said and done, or omitted to say and do,



<P>in the last four-and-twenty hours.&nbsp; It had been gradually yielding



<P>to the better hopes which her looks, or words, or actions



<P>occasionally encouraged; it had been vanquished at last by



<P>those sentiments and those tones which had reached him while she talked



<P>with Captain Harville; and under the irresistible governance of which



<P>he had seized a sheet of paper, and poured out his feelings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Of what he had then written, nothing was to be retracted or qualified.



<P>He persisted in having loved none but her.&nbsp; She had never been

supplanted.



<P>He never even believed himself to see her equal.&nbsp; Thus much indeed



<P>he was obliged to acknowledge:&nbsp; that he had been constant unconsciously,



<P>nay unintentionally; that he had meant to forget her, and believed it



<P>to be done.&nbsp; He had imagined himself indifferent, when he had only



<P>been angry; and he had been unjust to her merits, because he had been



<P>a sufferer from them.&nbsp; Her character was now fixed on his mind



<P>as perfection itself, maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude



<P>and gentleness; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at Uppercross



<P>had he learnt to do her justice, and only at Lyme had he begun



<P>to understand himself.&nbsp; At Lyme, he had received lessons



<P>of more than one sort.&nbsp; The passing admiration of Mr Elliot



<P>had at least roused him, and the scenes on the Cobb and at



<P>Captain Harville's had fixed her superiority.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove



<P>(the attempts of angry pride), he protested that he had for ever



<P>felt it to be impossible; that he had not cared, could not care,



<P>for Louisa; though till that day, till the leisure for reflection



<P>which followed it, he had not understood the perfect excellence



<P>of the mind with which Louisa's could so ill bear a comparison,



<P>or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own.



<P>There, he had learnt to distinguish between the steadiness of principle



<P>and the obstinacy of self-will, between the darings of heedlessness



<P>and the resolution of a collected mind.&nbsp; There he had seen everything



<P>to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost; and there begun



<P>to deplore the pride, the folly, the madness of resentment,



<P>which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>From that period his penance had become severe.&nbsp; He had no sooner



<P>been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days



<P>of Louisa's accident, no sooner begun to feel himself alive again,



<P>than he had begun to feel himself, though alive, not at liberty.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I found," said he, "that I was considered by Harville an engaged man!



<P>That neither Harville nor his wife entertained a doubt of our



<P>mutual attachment.&nbsp; I was startled and shocked.&nbsp; To a degree,



<P>I could contradict this instantly; but, when I began to reflect



<P>that others might have felt the same--her own family, nay,



<P>perhaps herself--I was no longer at my own disposal.&nbsp; I was hers

in honour



<P>if she wished it.&nbsp; I had been unguarded.&nbsp; I had not thought

seriously



<P>on this subject before.&nbsp; I had not considered that my excessive

intimacy



<P>must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways; and that I had



<P>no right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the

girls,



<P>at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report, were there no other



<P>ill effects.&nbsp; I had been grossly wrong, and must abide the consequences."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He found too late, in short, that he had entangled himself;



<P>and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring



<P>for Louisa at all, he must regard himself as bound to her,



<P>if her sentiments for him were what the Harvilles supposed.



<P>It determined him to leave Lyme, and await her complete recovery elsewhere.



<P>He would gladly weaken, by any fair means, whatever feelings or



<P>speculations concerning him might exist; and he went, therefore,



<P>to his brother's, meaning after a while to return to Kellynch,



<P>and act as circumstances might require.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was six weeks with Edward," said he, "and saw him happy.



<P>I could have no other pleasure.&nbsp; I deserved none.&nbsp; He enquired

after you



<P>very particularly; asked even if you were personally altered,



<P>little suspecting that to my eye you could never alter."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne smiled, and let it pass.&nbsp; It was too pleasing a blunder



<P>for a reproach.&nbsp; It is something for a woman to be assured,



<P>in her eight-and-twentieth year, that she has not lost one charm



<P>of earlier youth; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased



<P>to Anne, by comparing it with former words, and feeling it to be



<P>the result, not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had remained in Shropshire, lamenting the blindness of his own pride,



<P>and the blunders of his own calculations, till at once released from

Louisa



<P>by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement



<P>with Benwick.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here," said he, "ended the worst of my state; for now I could at least



<P>put myself in the way of happiness; I could exert myself;



<P>I could do something.&nbsp; But to be waiting so long in inaction,



<P>and waiting only for evil, had been dreadful.&nbsp; Within the first



<P>five minutes I said, `I will be at Bath on Wednesday,' and I was.



<P>Was it unpardonable to think it worth my while to come? and to arrive



<P>with some degree of hope?&nbsp; You were single.&nbsp; It was possible

that



<P>you might retain the feelings of the past, as I did; and one encouragement



<P>happened to be mine.&nbsp; I could never doubt that you would be loved

and



<P>sought by others, but I knew to a certainty that you had refused one

man,



<P>at least, of better pretensions than myself; and I could not help



<P>often saying, `Was this for me?'"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Their first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said,



<P>but the concert still more.&nbsp; That evening seemed to be made up



<P>of exquisite moments.&nbsp; The moment of her stepping forward



<P>in the Octagon Room to speak to him:&nbsp; the moment of Mr Elliot's

appearing



<P>and tearing her away, and one or two subsequent moments,



<P>marked by returning hope or increasing despondency, were dwelt on



<P>with energy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To see you," cried he, "in the midst of those who could not be



<P>my well-wishers; to see your cousin close by you, conversing and smiling,



<P>and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match!



<P>To consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope



<P>to influence you!&nbsp; Even if your own feelings were reluctant or

indifferent,



<P>to consider what powerful supports would be his!&nbsp; Was it not enough



<P>to make the fool of me which I appeared?&nbsp; How could I look on



<P>without agony?&nbsp; Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind

you,



<P>was not the recollection of what had been, the knowledge of her influence,



<P>the indelible, immoveable impression of what persuasion had once done--



<P>was it not all against me?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You should have distinguished," replied Anne.&nbsp; "You should not

have



<P>suspected me now; the case is so different, and my age is so different.



<P>If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once, remember that



<P>it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety, not of risk.



<P>When I yielded, I thought it was to duty, but no duty could be called



<P>in aid here.&nbsp; In marrying a man indifferent to me, all risk



<P>would have been incurred, and all duty violated."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus," he replied, "but I could not.



<P>I could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired



<P>of your character.&nbsp; I could not bring it into play; it was overwhelmed,



<P>buried, lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under



<P>year after year.&nbsp; I could think of you only as one who had yielded,



<P>who had given me up, who had been influenced by any one rather than

by me.



<P>I saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery.



<P>I had no reason to believe her of less authority now.&nbsp; The force

of habit



<P>was to be added."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I should have thought," said Anne, "that my manner to yourself



<P>might have spared you much or all of this."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, no! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement



<P>to another man would give.&nbsp; I left you in this belief; and yet,



<P>I was determined to see you again.&nbsp; My spirits rallied with the

morning,



<P>and I felt that I had still a motive for remaining here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At last Anne was at home again, and happier than any one in that house



<P>could have conceived.&nbsp; All the surprise and suspense, and every

other



<P>painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation,



<P>she re-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy



<P>in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last.



<P>An interval of meditation, serious and grateful, was the best corrective



<P>of everything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity; and she went



<P>to her room, and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness



<P>of her enjoyment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The evening came, the drawing-rooms were lighted up, the company assembled.

<BR>It was but a card party, it was but a mixture of those who had



<P>never met before, and those who met too often; a commonplace business,



<P>too numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but Anne had never

found



<P>an evening shorter.&nbsp; Glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness,



<P>and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for,



<P>she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr Elliot was there; she avoided, but she could pity him.

<BR>The Wallises, she had amusement in understanding them.&nbsp; Lady Dalrymple



<P>and Miss Carteret--they would soon be innoxious cousins to her.

<BR>She cared not for Mrs Clay, and had nothing to blush for in



<P>the public manners of her father and sister.&nbsp; With the Musgroves,



<P>there was the happy chat of perfect ease; with Captain Harville,



<P>the kind-hearted intercourse of brother and sister; with Lady Russell,



<P>attempts at conversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short;



<P>with Admiral and Mrs Croft, everything of peculiar cordiality and



<P>fervent interest, which the same consciousness sought to conceal;



<P>and with Captain Wentworth, some moments of communications



<P>continually occurring, and always the hope of more, and always



<P>the knowledge of his being there.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was in one of these short meetings, each apparently occupied



<P>in admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants, that she said--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have been thinking over the past, and trying impartially



<P>to judge of the right and wrong, I mean with regard to myself;



<P>and I must believe that I was right, much as I suffered from it,



<P>that I was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom



<P>you will love better than you do now.&nbsp; To me, she was in the place



<P>of a parent.&nbsp; Do not mistake me, however.&nbsp; I am not saying



<P>that she did not err in her advice.&nbsp; It was, perhaps, one of those

cases



<P>in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides;



<P>and for myself, I certainly never should, in any circumstance



<P>of tolerable similarity, give such advice.&nbsp; But I mean, that I

was right



<P>in submitting to her, and that if I had done otherwise, I should have



<P>suffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving

it up,



<P>because I should have suffered in my conscience.&nbsp; I have now,



<P>as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature, nothing



<P>to reproach myself with; and if I mistake not, a strong sense of duty



<P>is no bad part of a woman's portion."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He looked at her, looked at Lady Russell, and looking again at her,



<P>replied, as if in cool deliberation--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not yet.&nbsp; But there are hopes of her being forgiven in time.

<BR>I trust to being in charity with her soon.&nbsp; But I too have been



<P>thinking over the past, and a&nbsp; question has suggested itself,



<P>whether there may not have been one person more my enemy



<P>even than that lady?&nbsp; My own self.&nbsp; Tell me if, when I returned



<P>to England in the year eight, with a few thousand pounds,



<P>and was posted into the Laconia, if I had then written to you,



<P>would you have answered my letter?&nbsp; Would you, in short,



<P>have renewed the engagement then?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Would I!" was all her answer; but the accent was decisive enough.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Good God!" he cried, "you would!&nbsp; It is not that I did not think

of it,



<P>or desire it, as what could alone crown all my other success;



<P>but I was proud, too proud to ask again.&nbsp; I did not understand

you.

<BR>I shut my eyes, and would not understand you, or do you justice.

<BR>This is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one



<P>sooner than myself.&nbsp; Six years of separation and suffering



<P>might have been spared.&nbsp; It is a sort of pain, too, which is new

to me.

<BR>I have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn



<P>every blessing that I enjoyed.&nbsp; I have valued myself on honourable

toils



<P>and just rewards.&nbsp; Like other great men under reverses," he added,



<P>with a smile. "I must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune.

<BR>I must learn to brook being happier than I deserve."

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Anne went home to think over all that she had heard.&nbsp; In one point,



<P>her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Elliot.



<P>There was no longer anything of tenderness due to him.&nbsp; He stood

as



<P>opposed to Captain Wentworth, in all his own unwelcome obtrusiveness;



<P>and the evil of his attentions last night, the irremediable mischief



<P>he might have done, was considered with sensations unqualified, unperplexed.



<P>Pity for him was all over.&nbsp; But this was the only point of relief.



<P>In every other respect, in looking around her, or penetrating forward,



<P>she saw more to distrust and to apprehend.&nbsp; She was concerned



<P>for the disappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling;



<P>for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister,



<P>and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils, without knowing



<P>how to avert any one of them.&nbsp; She was most thankful for her own



<P>knowledge of him.&nbsp; She had never considered herself as entitled

to reward



<P>for not slighting an old friend like Mrs Smith, but here was



<P>a reward indeed springing from it!&nbsp; Mrs Smith had been able to

tell her



<P>what no one else could have done.&nbsp; Could the knowledge have



<P>been extended through her family?&nbsp; But this was a vain idea.



<P>She must talk to Lady Russell, tell her, consult with her,



<P>and having done her best, wait the event with as much composure



<P>as possible; and after all, her greatest want of composure would be



<P>in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to Lady Russell;



<P>in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She found, on reaching home, that she had, as she intended,



<P>escaped seeing Mr Elliot; that he had called and paid them



<P>a long morning visit; but hardly had she congratulated herself,



<P>and felt safe, when she heard that he was coming again in the evening.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I had not the smallest intention of asking him," said Elizabeth,



<P>with affected carelessness, "but he gave so many hints;



<P>so Mrs Clay says, at least."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed, I do say it.&nbsp; I never saw anybody in my life spell harder



<P>for an invitation.&nbsp; Poor man!&nbsp; I was really in pain for him;



<P>for your hard-hearted sister, Miss Anne, seems bent on cruelty."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I have been rather too much used to the game



<P>to be soon overcome by a gentleman's hints.&nbsp; However, when I found



<P>how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father



<P>this morning, I gave way immediately, for I would never really omit



<P>an opportunity of bring him and Sir Walter together.&nbsp; They appear

to



<P>so much advantage in company with each other.&nbsp; Each behaving so

pleasantly.



<P>Mr Elliot looking up with so much respect."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Quite delightful!" cried Mrs Clay, not daring, however,



<P>to turn her eyes towards Anne.&nbsp; "Exactly like father and son!



<P>Dear Miss Elliot, may I not say father and son?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! I lay no embargo on any body's words.&nbsp; If you will have such



<P>ideas!&nbsp; But, upon my word, I am scarcely sensible of his attentions



<P>being beyond those of other men."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Miss Elliot!" exclaimed Mrs Clay, lifting her hands and eyes,



<P>and sinking all the rest of her astonishment in a convenient silence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, my dear Penelope, you need not be so alarmed about him.



<P>I did invite him, you know.&nbsp; I sent him away with smiles.



<P>When I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park



<P>for the whole day to-morrow, I had compassion on him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne admired the good acting of the friend, in being able to shew



<P>such pleasure as she did, in the expectation and in the actual arrival



<P>of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with



<P>her prime object.&nbsp; It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate



<P>the sight of Mr Elliot; and yet she could assume a most obliging,



<P>placid look, and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license



<P>of devoting herself only half as much to Sir Walter as she would have



<P>done otherwise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To Anne herself it was most distressing to see Mr Elliot enter the room;



<P>and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her.



<P>She had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere,



<P>but now she saw insincerity in everything.&nbsp; His attentive deference



<P>to her father, contrasted with his former language, was odious;



<P>and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith,



<P>she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness,



<P>or the sound of his artificial good sentiments.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke



<P>a remonstrance on his side.&nbsp; It was a great object to her to escape



<P>all enquiry or eclat; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool



<P>to him as might be compatible with their relationship; and to retrace,



<P>as quietly as she could, the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had



<P>been gradually led along.&nbsp; She was accordingly more guarded,



<P>and more cool, than she had been the night before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He wanted to animate her curiosity again as to how and where



<P>he could have heard her formerly praised; wanted very much



<P>to be gratified by more solicitation; but the charm was broken:



<P>he found that the heat and animation of a public room was necessary



<P>to kindle his modest cousin's vanity; he found, at least, that it was



<P>not to be done now, by any of those attempts which he could hazard



<P>among the too-commanding claims of the others.&nbsp; He little surmised



<P>that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest,



<P>bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct



<P>which were least excusable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had some satisfaction in finding that he was really going out of

Bath



<P>the next morning, going early, and that he would be gone the greater

part



<P>of two days.&nbsp; He was invited again to Camden Place the very evening

of



<P>his return; but from Thursday to Saturday evening his absence was certain.



<P>It was bad enough that a Mrs Clay should be always before her;



<P>but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their party,



<P>seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort.



<P>It was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practiced



<P>on her father and Elizabeth; to consider the various sources



<P>of mortification preparing for them!&nbsp; Mrs Clay's selfishness was



<P>not so complicate nor so revolting as his; and Anne would have compounded



<P>for the marriage at once, with all its evils, to be clear of Mr Elliot's



<P>subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On Friday morning she meant to go very early to Lady Russell,



<P>and accomplish the necessary communication; and she would have gone



<P>directly after breakfast, but that Mrs Clay was also going out



<P>on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble, which



<P>determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion.



<P>She saw Mrs Clay fairly off, therefore, before she began to talk



<P>of spending the morning in Rivers Street.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very well," said Elizabeth, "I have nothing to send but my love.



<P>Oh! you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me,



<P>and pretend I have read it through.&nbsp; I really cannot be plaguing

myself



<P>for ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out.



<P>Lady Russell quite bores one with her new publications.



<P>You need not tell her so, but I thought her dress hideous the other

night.



<P>I used to think she had some taste in dress, but I was ashamed of her



<P>at the concert.&nbsp; Something so formal and arrange in her air!



<P>and she sits so upright!&nbsp; My best love, of course."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And mine," added Sir Walter.&nbsp; "Kindest regards.&nbsp; And you

may say,



<P>that I mean to call upon her soon.&nbsp; Make a civil message;



<P>but I shall only leave my card.&nbsp; Morning visits are never fair



<P>by women at her time of life, who make themselves up so little.



<P>If she would only wear rouge she would not be afraid of being seen;



<P>but last time I called, I observed the blinds were let down immediately."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While her father spoke, there was a knock at the door.&nbsp; Who could

it be?



<P>Anne, remembering the preconcerted visits, at all hours, of Mr Elliot,



<P>would have expected him, but for his known engagement seven miles off.



<P>After the usual period of suspense, the usual sounds of approach were

heard,



<P>and "Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove" were ushered into the room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance;



<P>but Anne was really glad to see them; and the others were not so sorry



<P>but that they could put on a decent air of welcome; and as soon



<P>as it became clear that these, their nearest relations, were not arrived



<P>with an views of accommodation in that house, Sir Walter and Elizabeth



<P>were able to rise in cordiality, and do the honours of it very well.



<P>They were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove, and were



<P>at the White Hart.&nbsp; So much was pretty soon understood;



<P>but till Sir Walter and Elizabeth were walking Mary into



<P>the other drawing-room, and regaling themselves with her admiration,



<P>Anne could not draw upon Charles's brain for a regular history



<P>of their coming, or an explanation of some smiling hints



<P>of particular business, which had been ostentatiously dropped by Mary,



<P>as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted

of.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove, Henrietta,



<P>and Captain Harville, beside their two selves.&nbsp; He gave her a very

plain,



<P>intelligible account of the whole; a narration in which she saw



<P>a great deal of most characteristic proceeding.&nbsp; The scheme



<P>had received its first impulse by Captain Harville's wanting to



<P>come to Bath on business.&nbsp; He had begun to talk of it a week ago;



<P>and by way of doing something, as shooting was over, Charles had proposed



<P>coming with him, and Mrs Harville had seemed to like the idea of it



<P>very much, as an advantage to her husband; but Mary could not bear



<P>to be left, and had made herself so unhappy about it, that for a day

or two



<P>everything seemed to be in suspense, or at an end.&nbsp; But then,



<P>it had been taken up by his father and mother.&nbsp; His mother had



<P>some old friends in Bath whom she wanted to see; it was thought



<P>a good opportunity for Henrietta to come and buy wedding-clothes



<P>for herself and her sister; and, in short, it ended in being



<P>his mother's party, that everything might be comfortable and easy



<P>to Captain Harville; and he and Mary were included in it



<P>by way of general convenience.&nbsp; They had arrived late the night

before.



<P>Mrs Harville, her children, and Captain Benwick, remained with



<P>Mr Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne's only surprise was, that affairs should be in forwardness enough



<P>for Henrietta's wedding-clothes to be talked of.&nbsp; She had imagined



<P>such difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent



<P>the marriage from being near at hand; but she learned from Charles that,



<P>very recently, (since Mary's last letter to herself), Charles Hayter



<P>had been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth



<P>who could not possibly claim it under many years; and that



<P>on the strength of his present income, with almost a certainty



<P>of something more permanent long before the term in question,



<P>the two families had consented to the young people's wishes,



<P>and that their marriage was likely to take place in a few months,



<P>quite as soon as Louisa's.&nbsp; "And a very good living it was,"



<P>Charles added:&nbsp; "only five-and-twenty miles from Uppercross,



<P>and in a very fine country:&nbsp;&nbsp; fine part of Dorsetshire.



<P>In the centre of some of the best preserves in the kingdom,



<P>surrounded by three great proprietors, each more careful and jealous



<P>than the other; and to two of the three at least, Charles Hayter might

get



<P>a special recommendation.&nbsp; Not that he will value it as he ought,"



<P>he observed, "Charles is too cool about sporting. That's the worst of

him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am extremely glad, indeed," cried Anne, "particularly glad



<P>that this should happen; and that of two sisters, who both deserve



<P>equally well, and who have always been such good friends,



<P>the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other--



<P>that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort.



<P>I hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! yes.&nbsp; My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were

richer,



<P>but he has no other fault to find.&nbsp; Money, you know, coming down

with



<P>money--two daughters at once--it cannot be a very agreeable operation,



<P>and it streightens him as to many things.&nbsp; However, I do not mean

to say



<P>they have not a right to it.&nbsp; It is very fit they should have



<P>daughters' shares; and I am sure he has always been a very kind,



<P>liberal father to me.&nbsp; Mary does not above half like Henrietta's

match.



<P>She never did, you know.&nbsp; But she does not do him justice,



<P>nor think enough about Winthrop.&nbsp; I cannot make her attend to



<P>the value of the property.&nbsp; It is a very fair match, as times go;



<P>and I have liked Charles Hayter all my life, and I shall not leave off

now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove," exclaimed Anne,



<P>"should be happy in their children's marriages.&nbsp; They do everything



<P>to confer happiness, I am sure.&nbsp; What a blessing to young people



<P>to be in such hands!&nbsp; Your father and mother seem so totally free



<P>from all those ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct



<P>and misery, both in young and old.&nbsp; I hope you think Louisa



<P>perfectly recovered now?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He answered rather hesitatingly, "Yes, I believe I do; very much recovered;



<P>but she is altered; there is no running or jumping about, no laughing



<P>or dancing; it is quite different.&nbsp; If one happens only to shut

the door



<P>a little hard, she starts and wriggles like a young dab-chick in the

water;



<P>and Benwick sits at her elbow, reading verses, or whispering to her,



<P>all day long."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne could not help laughing.&nbsp; "That cannot be much to your taste,



<P>I know," said she; "but I do believe him to be an excellent young man."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To be sure he is.&nbsp; Nobody doubts it; and I hope you do not think



<P>I am so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and



<P>pleasures as myself.&nbsp; I have a great value for Benwick; and when

one can



<P>but get him to talk, he has plenty to say.&nbsp; His reading has done

him



<P>no harm, for he has fought as well as read.&nbsp; He is a brave fellow.



<P>I got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before.



<P>We had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in



<P>my father's great barns; and he played his part so well



<P>that I have liked him the better ever since."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles's



<P>following the others to admire mirrors and china; but Anne had



<P>heard enough to understand the present state of Uppercross,



<P>and rejoice in its happiness; and though she sighed as she rejoiced,



<P>her sigh had none of the ill-will of envy in it.&nbsp; She would certainly



<P>have risen to their blessings if she could, but she did not want



<P>to lessen theirs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The visit passed off altogether in high good humour.&nbsp; Mary was



<P>in excellent spirits, enjoying the gaiety and the change,



<P>and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother-in-law's carriage



<P>with four horses, and with her own complete independence of Camden Place,



<P>that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought,



<P>and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house,



<P>as they were detailed to her.&nbsp; She had no demands on her father

or sister,



<P>and her consequence was just enough increased by their handsome



<P>drawing-rooms.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Elizabeth was, for a short time, suffering a good deal.



<P>She felt that Mrs Musgrove and all her party ought to be asked



<P>to dine with them; but she could not bear to have the difference of

style,



<P>the reduction of servants, which a dinner must betray, witnessed by

those



<P>who had been always so inferior to the Elliots of Kellynch.



<P>It was a struggle between propriety and vanity; but vanity got the better,



<P>and then Elizabeth was happy again.&nbsp; These were her internal persuasions:



<P>"Old fashioned notions; country hospitality; we do not profess



<P>to give dinners; few people in Bath do; Lady Alicia never does;



<P>did not even ask her own sister's family, though they were here a month:



<P>and I dare say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove;



<P>put her quite out of her way.&nbsp; I am sure she would rather not come;



<P>she cannot feel easy with us.&nbsp; I will ask them all for an evening;



<P>that will be much better; that will be a novelty and a treat.



<P>They have not seen two such drawing rooms before.&nbsp; They will be

delighted



<P>to come to-morrow evening.&nbsp; It shall be a regular party, small,



<P>but most elegant."&nbsp; And this satisfied Elizabeth:&nbsp; and when

the invitation



<P>was given to the two present, and promised for the absent,



<P>Mary was as completely satisfied.&nbsp; She was particularly asked



<P>to meet Mr Elliot, and be introduced to Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret,



<P>who were fortunately already engaged to come; and she could not



<P>have received a more gratifying attention.&nbsp; Miss Elliot was to

have



<P>the honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the course of the morning;



<P>and Anne walked off with Charles and Mary, to go and see her



<P>and Henrietta directly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present.



<P>They all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes;



<P>but Anne convinced herself that a day's delay of the intended communication



<P>could be of no consequence, and hastened forward to the White Hart,



<P>to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn,



<P>with an eagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to

form.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within, and by themselves,



<P>and Anne had the kindest welcome from each.&nbsp; Henrietta was exactly



<P>in that state of recently-improved views, of fresh-formed happiness,



<P>which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had



<P>ever liked before at all; and Mrs Musgrove's real affection had been

won



<P>by her usefulness when they were in distress.&nbsp; It was a heartiness,



<P>and a warmth, and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more,



<P>from the sad want of such blessings at home.&nbsp; She was entreated



<P>to give them as much of her time as possible, invited for every day



<P>and all day long, or rather claimed as part of the family; and, in return,



<P>she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance,



<P>and on Charles's leaving them together, was listening to Mrs Musgrove's



<P>history of Louisa, and to Henrietta's of herself, giving opinions



<P>on business, and recommendations to shops; with intervals of every help



<P>which Mary required, from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts;



<P>from finding her keys, and assorting her trinkets, to trying



<P>to convince her that she was not ill-used by anybody; which Mary,



<P>well amused as she generally was, in her station at a window



<P>overlooking the entrance to the Pump Room, could not but have



<P>her moments of imagining.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A morning of thorough confusion was to be expected.&nbsp; A large party



<P>in an hotel ensured a quick-changing, unsettled scene.&nbsp; One five

minutes



<P>brought a note, the next a parcel; and Anne had not been there



<P>half an hour, when their dining-room, spacious as it was,



<P>seemed more than half filled:&nbsp; a party of steady old friends



<P>were seated around Mrs Musgrove, and Charles came back with



<P>Captains Harville and Wentworth.&nbsp; The appearance of the latter



<P>could not be more than the surprise of the moment.&nbsp; It was impossible



<P>for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their



<P>common friends must be soon bringing them together again.



<P>Their last meeting had been most important in opening his feelings;



<P>she had derived from it a delightful conviction; but she feared



<P>from his looks, that the same unfortunate persuasion, which had



<P>hastened him away from the Concert Room, still governed.



<P>He did not seem to want to be near enough for conversation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She tried to be calm, and leave things to take their course,



<P>and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence:--



<P>"Surely, if there be constant attachment on each side, our hearts



<P>must understand each other ere long.&nbsp; We are not boy and girl,



<P>to be captiously irritable, misled by every moment's inadvertence,



<P>and wantonly playing with our own happiness."&nbsp; And yet,



<P>a few minutes afterwards, she felt as if their being in company



<P>with each other, under their present circumstances, could only be



<P>exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most



<P>mischievous kind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Anne," cried Mary, still at her window, "there is Mrs Clay,



<P>I am sure, standing under the colonnade, and a gentleman with her.



<P>I saw them turn the corner from Bath Street just now.&nbsp; They seemed



<P>deep in talk.&nbsp; Who is it?&nbsp; Come, and tell me.&nbsp; Good heavens!

I recollect.



<P>It is Mr Elliot himself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No," cried Anne, quickly, "it cannot be Mr Elliot, I assure you.



<P>He was to leave Bath at nine this morning, and does not come back



<P>till to-morrow."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As she spoke, she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her,



<P>the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her, and made her regret



<P>that she had said so much, simple as it was.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mary, resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin,



<P>began talking very warmly about the family features, and protesting



<P>still more positively that it was Mr Elliot, calling again upon Anne



<P>to come and look for herself, but Anne did not mean to stir,



<P>and tried to be cool and unconcerned.&nbsp; Her distress returned,



<P>however, on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between



<P>two or three of the lady visitors, as if they believed themselves



<P>quite in the secret.&nbsp; It was evident that the report concerning

her



<P>had spread, and a short pause succeeded, which seemed to ensure



<P>that it would now spread farther.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do come, Anne" cried Mary, "come and look yourself.&nbsp; You will

be too late



<P>if you do not make haste.&nbsp; They are parting; they are shaking hands.



<P>He is turning away.&nbsp; Not know Mr Elliot, indeed!&nbsp; You seem

to have



<P>forgot all about Lyme."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To pacify Mary, and perhaps screen her own embarrassment,



<P>Anne did move quietly to the window.&nbsp; She was just in time to ascertain



<P>that it really was Mr Elliot, which she had never believed,



<P>before he disappeared on one side, as Mrs Clay walked quickly off



<P>on the other; and checking the surprise which she could not but feel



<P>at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons



<P>of totally opposite interest, she calmly said, "Yes, it is Mr Elliot,



<P>certainly.&nbsp; He has changed his hour of going, I suppose, that is

all,



<P>or I may be mistaken, I might not attend;" and walked back to her chair,



<P>recomposed, and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself

well.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The visitors took their leave; and Charles, having civilly seen them

off,



<P>and then made a face at them, and abused them for coming, began with--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, mother, I have done something for you that you will like.



<P>I have been to the theatre, and secured a box for to-morrow night.



<P>A'n't I a good boy?&nbsp; I know you love a play; and there is room

for us all.



<P>It holds nine.&nbsp; I have engaged Captain Wentworth.&nbsp; Anne will



<P>not be sorry to join us, I am sure.&nbsp; We all like a play.



<P>Have not I done well, mother?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her perfect readiness



<P>for the play, if Henrietta and all the others liked it, when Mary



<P>eagerly interrupted her by exclaiming--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Good heavens, Charles! how can you think of such a thing?



<P>Take a box for to-morrow night!&nbsp; Have you forgot that we are engaged



<P>to Camden Place to-morrow night? and that we were most particularly

asked



<P>to meet Lady Dalrymple and her daughter, and Mr Elliot, and all



<P>the principal family connexions, on purpose to be introduced to them?



<P>How can you be so forgetful?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Phoo! phoo!" replied Charles, "what's an evening party?



<P>Never worth remembering.&nbsp; Your father might have asked us to dinner,



<P>I think, if he had wanted to see us.&nbsp; You may do as you like,



<P>but I shall go to the play."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! Charles, I declare it will be too abominable if you do,



<P>when you promised to go."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I did not promise.&nbsp; I only smirked and bowed, and said the

word



<P>`happy.'&nbsp; There was no promise."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But you must go, Charles.&nbsp; It would be unpardonable to fail.



<P>We were asked on purpose to be introduced.&nbsp; There was always



<P>such a great connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves.



<P>Nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately.



<P>We are quite near relations, you know; and Mr Elliot too,



<P>whom you ought so particularly to be acquainted with!&nbsp; Every attention



<P>is due to Mr Elliot.&nbsp; Consider, my father's heir:&nbsp; the future



<P>representative of the family."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't talk to me about heirs and representatives," cried Charles.



<P>"I am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow



<P>to the rising sun.&nbsp; If I would not go for the sake of your father,



<P>I should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir.



<P>What is Mr Elliot to me?"&nbsp; The careless expression was life to

Anne,



<P>who saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention, looking and



<P>listening with his whole soul; and that the last words brought



<P>his enquiring eyes from Charles to herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Charles and Mary still talked on in the same style; he, half serious



<P>and half jesting, maintaining the scheme for the play, and she,



<P>invariably serious, most warmly opposing it, and not omitting



<P>to make it known that, however determined to go to Camden Place herself,



<P>she should not think herself very well used, if they went to the play



<P>without her.&nbsp; Mrs Musgrove interposed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We had better put it off.&nbsp; Charles, you had much better go back



<P>and change the box for Tuesday.&nbsp; It would be a pity to be divided,



<P>and we should be losing Miss Anne, too, if there is a party at her father's;



<P>and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play,



<P>if Miss Anne could not be with us."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness; and quite as much



<P>so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If it depended only on my inclination, ma'am, the party at home



<P>(excepting on Mary's account) would not be the smallest impediment.



<P>I have no pleasure in the sort of meeting, and should be too happy



<P>to change it for a play, and with you.&nbsp; But, it had better



<P>not be attempted, perhaps."&nbsp; She had spoken it; but she trembled



<P>when it was done, conscious that her words were listened to,



<P>and daring not even to try to observe their effect.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day;



<P>Charles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife,



<P>by persisting that he would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else

would.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Captain Wentworth left his seat, and walked to the fire-place;



<P>probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards,



<P>and taking a station, with less bare-faced design, by Anne.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You have not been long enough in Bath," said he, "to enjoy



<P>the evening parties of the place."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! no.&nbsp; The usual character of them has nothing for me.



<P>I am no card-player."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You were not formerly, I know.&nbsp; You did not use to like cards;



<P>but time makes many changes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am not yet so much changed," cried Anne, and stopped, fearing she



<P>hardly knew what misconstruction.&nbsp; After waiting a few moments



<P>he said, and as if it were the result of immediate feeling,



<P>"It is a period, indeed!&nbsp; Eight years and a half is a period."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Whether he would have proceeded farther was left to Anne's imagination



<P>to ponder over in a calmer hour; for while still hearing the sounds



<P>he had uttered, she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta,



<P>eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out,



<P>and calling on her companions to lose no time, lest somebody else



<P>should come in.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They were obliged to move.&nbsp; Anne talked of being perfectly ready,



<P>and tried to look it; but she felt that could Henrietta have known



<P>the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair,



<P>in preparing to quit the room, she would have found, in all her own



<P>sensations for her cousin, in the very security of his affection,



<P>wherewith to pity her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Their preparations, however, were stopped short.&nbsp; Alarming sounds



<P>were heard; other visitors approached, and the door was thrown open



<P>for Sir Walter and Miss Elliot, whose entrance seemed to give



<P>a general chill.&nbsp; Anne felt an instant oppression, and wherever

she looked



<P>saw symptoms of the same.&nbsp; The comfort, the freedom, the gaiety



<P>of the room was over, hushed into cold composure, determined silence,



<P>or insipid talk, to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister.



<P>How mortifying to feel that it was so!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular.&nbsp; Captain Wentworth



<P>was acknowledged again by each, by Elizabeth more graciously than before.



<P>She even addressed him once, and looked at him more than once.



<P>Elizabeth was, in fact, revolving a great measure.&nbsp; The sequel



<P>explained it.&nbsp; After the waste of a few minutes in saying



<P>the proper nothings, she began to give the invitation which



<P>was to comprise all the remaining dues of the Musgroves.



<P>"To-morrow evening, to meet a few friends:&nbsp; no formal party."



<P>It was all said very gracefully, and the cards with which she had



<P>provided herself, the "Miss Elliot at home," were laid on the table,



<P>with a courteous, comprehensive smile to all, and one smile and



<P>one card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth.&nbsp; The truth was,



<P>that Elizabeth had been long enough in Bath to understand



<P>the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his.



<P>The past was nothing.&nbsp; The present was that Captain Wentworth



<P>would move about well in her drawing-room.&nbsp; The card was pointedly

given,



<P>and Sir Walter and Elizabeth arose and disappeared.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The interruption had been short, though severe, and ease and animation



<P>returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out,



<P>but not to Anne.&nbsp; She could think only of the invitation she had



<P>with such astonishment witnessed, and of the manner in which



<P>it had been received; a manner of doubtful meaning, of surprise rather



<P>than gratification, of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance.



<P>She knew him; she saw disdain in his eye, and could not venture to believe



<P>that he had determined to accept such an offering, as an atonement



<P>for all the insolence of the past.&nbsp; Her spirits sank.&nbsp; He

held the card



<P>in his hand after they were gone, as if deeply considering it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Only think of Elizabeth's including everybody!" whispered Mary



<P>very audibly.&nbsp; "I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted!



<P>You see he cannot put the card out of his hand."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne caught his eye, saw his cheeks glow, and his mouth form itself



<P>into a momentary expression of contempt, and turned away,



<P>that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The party separated.&nbsp; The gentlemen had their own pursuits,



<P>the ladies proceeded on their own business, and they met no more while



<P>Anne belonged to them.&nbsp; She was earnestly begged to return and

dine,



<P>and give them all the rest of the day, but her spirits had been



<P>so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more,



<P>and fit only for home, where she might be sure of being as silent



<P>as she chose.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Promising to be with them the whole of the following morning, therefore,



<P>she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to Camden

Place,



<P>there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements



<P>of Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow's party, the frequent enumeration



<P>of the persons invited, and the continually improving detail of all



<P>the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant



<P>of its kind in Bath, while harassing herself with the never-ending



<P>question, of whether Captain Wentworth would come or not?&nbsp; They

were



<P>reckoning him as certain, but with her it was a gnawing solicitude



<P>never appeased for five minutes together.&nbsp; She generally thought



<P>he would come, because she generally thought he ought; but it was a

case



<P>which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion,



<P>as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation,



<P>to let Mrs Clay know that she had been seen with Mr Elliot



<P>three hours after his being supposed to be out of Bath,



<P>for having watched in vain for some intimation of the interview



<P>from the lady herself, she determined to mention it, and it seemed to

her



<P>there was guilt in Mrs Clay's face as she listened.&nbsp; It was transient:



<P>cleared away in an instant; but Anne could imagine she read there



<P>the consciousness of having, by some complication of mutual trick,



<P>or some overbearing authority of his, been obliged to attend



<P>(perhaps for half an hour) to his lectures and restrictions on her designs



<P>on Sir Walter.&nbsp; She exclaimed, however, with a very tolerable



<P>imitation of nature: --

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! dear! very true.&nbsp; Only think, Miss Elliot, to my great surprise



<P>I met with Mr Elliot in Bath Street.&nbsp; I was never more astonished.



<P>He turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard.&nbsp; He had been

prevented



<P>setting off for Thornberry, but I really forget by what;



<P>for I was in a hurry, and could not much attend, and I can only answer



<P>for his being determined not to be delayed in his return.



<P>He wanted to know how early he might be admitted to-morrow.



<P>He was full of `to-morrow,' and it is very evident that I have been



<P>full of it too, ever since I entered the house, and learnt the extension



<P>of your plan and all that had happened, or my seeing him could never

have



<P>gone so entirely out of my head."

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Sir Walter, his two daughters, and Mrs Clay, were the earliest



<P>of all their party at the rooms in the evening; and as Lady Dalrymple



<P>must be waited for, they took their station by one of the fires



<P>in the Octagon Room.&nbsp; But hardly were they so settled, when the

door



<P>opened again, and Captain Wentworth walked in alone.&nbsp; Anne was



<P>the nearest to him, and making yet a little advance, she instantly spoke.



<P>He was preparing only to bow and pass on, but her gentle "How do you

do?"



<P>brought him out of the straight line to stand near her, and make enquiries



<P>in return, in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back

ground.



<P>Their being in the back ground was a support to Anne; she knew nothing



<P>of their looks, and felt equal to everything which she believed



<P>right to be done.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While they were speaking, a whispering between her father and Elizabeth



<P>caught her ear.&nbsp; She could not distinguish, but she must guess

the subject;



<P>and on Captain Wentworth's making a distant bow, she comprehended



<P>that her father had judged so well as to give him that



<P>simple acknowledgement of acquaintance, and she was just in time



<P>by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself.



<P>This, though late, and reluctant, and ungracious, was yet



<P>better than nothing, and her spirits improved.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After talking, however, of the weather, and Bath, and the concert,



<P>their conversation began to flag, and so little was said at last,



<P>that she was expecting him to go every moment, but he did not;



<P>he seemed in no hurry to leave her; and presently with renewed spirit,



<P>with a little smile, a little glow, he said--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme.&nbsp; I am afraid you

must have



<P>suffered from the shock, and the more from its not overpowering you



<P>at the time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She assured him that she had not.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It was a frightful hour," said he, "a frightful day!" and he



<P>passed his hand across his eyes, as if the remembrance were still



<P>too painful, but in a moment, half smiling again, added,



<P>"The day has produced some effects however; has had some consequences



<P>which must be considered as the very reverse of frightful.



<P>When you had the presence of mind to suggest that Benwick would be



<P>the properest person to fetch a surgeon, you could have little idea



<P>of his being eventually one of those most concerned in her recovery."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Certainly I could have none.&nbsp; But it appears--I should hope it

would be



<P>a very happy match.&nbsp; There are on both sides good principles



<P>and good temper."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," said he, looking not exactly forward; "but there, I think,



<P>ends the resemblance.&nbsp; With all my soul I wish them happy, and

rejoice



<P>over every circumstance in favour of it.&nbsp; They have no difficulties



<P>to contend with at home, no opposition, no caprice, no delays.



<P>The Musgroves are behaving like themselves, most honourably and kindly,



<P>only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter's comfort.



<P>All this is much, very much in favour of their happiness;



<P>more than perhaps--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He stopped.&nbsp; A sudden recollection seemed to occur, and to give

him



<P>some taste of that emotion which was reddening Anne's cheeks



<P>and fixing her eyes on the ground.&nbsp; After clearing his throat,

however,



<P>he proceeded thus--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I confess that I do think there is a disparity, too great a disparity,



<P>and in a point no less essential than mind.&nbsp; I regard Louisa Musgrove



<P>as a very amiable, sweet-tempered girl, and not deficient in understanding,



<P>but Benwick is something more.&nbsp; He is a clever man, a reading man;



<P>and I confess, that I do consider his attaching himself to her



<P>with some surprise.&nbsp; Had it been the effect of gratitude,



<P>had he learnt to love her, because he believed her to be preferring

him,



<P>it would have been another thing.&nbsp; But I have no reason to suppose

it so.



<P>It seems, on the contrary, to have been a perfectly spontaneous,



<P>untaught feeling on his side, and this surprises me.&nbsp; A man like

him,



<P>in his situation! with a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken!



<P>Fanny Harville was a very superior creature, and his attachment to her



<P>was indeed attachment.&nbsp; A man does not recover from such



<P>a devotion of the heart to such a woman.&nbsp; He ought not; he does

not."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Either from the consciousness, however, that his friend had recovered,



<P>or from other consciousness, he went no farther; and Anne who,



<P>in spite of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered,



<P>and in spite of all the various noises of the room, the almost ceaseless



<P>slam of the door, and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through,



<P>had distinguished every word, was struck, gratified, confused,



<P>and beginning to breathe very quick, and feel an hundred things



<P>in a moment.&nbsp; It was impossible for her to enter on such a subject;



<P>and yet, after a pause, feeling the necessity of speaking,



<P>and having not the smallest wish for a total change, she only deviated



<P>so far as to say--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You were a good while at Lyme, I think?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"About a fortnight.&nbsp; I could not leave it till Louisa's doing well



<P>was quite ascertained.&nbsp; I had been too deeply concerned in the

mischief



<P>to be soon at peace.&nbsp; It had been my doing, solely mine.



<P>She would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak.



<P>The country round Lyme is very fine.&nbsp; I walked and rode a great

deal;



<P>and the more I saw, the more I found to admire."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I should very much like to see Lyme again," said Anne.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed!&nbsp; I should not have supposed that you could have found



<P>anything in Lyme to inspire such a feeling.&nbsp; The horror and distress



<P>you were involved in, the stretch of mind, the wear of spirits!



<P>I should have thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been



<P>strong disgust."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The last hours were certainly very painful," replied Anne;



<P>"but when pain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure.



<P>One does not love a place the less for having suffered in it,



<P>unless it has been all suffering, nothing but suffering, which was



<P>by no means the case at Lyme.&nbsp; We were only in anxiety and distress



<P>during the last two hours, and previously there had been a great deal



<P>of enjoyment.&nbsp; So much novelty and beauty! I have travelled so

little,



<P>that every fresh place would be interesting to me; but there is real

beauty



<P>at Lyme; and in short" (with a faint blush at some recollections),



<P>"altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As she ceased, the entrance door opened again, and the very party appeared



<P>for whom they were waiting.&nbsp; "Lady Dalrymple, Lady Dalrymple,"



<P>was the rejoicing sound; and with all the eagerness compatible



<P>with anxious elegance, Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward



<P>to meet her.&nbsp; Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, escorted by Mr

Elliot



<P>and Colonel Wallis, who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant,



<P>advanced into the room.&nbsp; The others joined them, and it was



<P>a group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included.



<P>She was divided from Captain Wentworth.&nbsp; Their interesting,



<P>almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time,



<P>but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought

it on!



<P>She had learnt, in the last ten minutes, more of his feelings



<P>towards Louisa, more of all his feelings than she dared to think of;



<P>and she gave herself up to the demands of the party, to the needful



<P>civilities of the moment, with exquisite, though agitated sensations.



<P>She was in good humour with all.&nbsp; She had received ideas which



<P>disposed her to be courteous and kind to all, and to pity every one,



<P>as being less happy than herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The delightful emotions were a little subdued, when on stepping back



<P>from the group, to be joined again by Captain Wentworth, she saw



<P>that he was gone.&nbsp; She was just in time to see him turn into



<P>the Concert Room.&nbsp; He was gone; he had disappeared, she felt



<P>a moment's regret.&nbsp; But "they should meet again.&nbsp; He would

look for her,



<P>he would find her out before the evening were over, and at present,



<P>perhaps, it was as well to be asunder.&nbsp; She was in need of



<P>a little interval for recollection."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Upon Lady Russell's appearance soon afterwards, the whole party



<P>was collected, and all that remained was to marshal themselves,



<P>and proceed into the Concert Room; and be of all the consequence



<P>in their power, draw as many eyes, excite as many whispers,



<P>and disturb as many people as they could.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Very, very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked

in.



<P>Elizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret, and looking on the broad back



<P>of the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her, had nothing to wish

for



<P>which did not seem within her reach; and Anne--but it would be



<P>an insult to the nature of Anne's felicity, to draw any comparison



<P>between it and her sister's; the origin of one all selfish vanity,



<P>of the other all generous attachment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne saw nothing, thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room.



<P>Her happiness was from within.&nbsp; Her eyes were bright and her cheeks

glowed;



<P>but she knew nothing about it.&nbsp; She was thinking only of



<P>the last half hour, and as they passed to their seats, her mind took



<P>a hasty range over it.&nbsp; His choice of subjects, his expressions,



<P>and still more his manner and look, had been such as she could see



<P>in only one light.&nbsp; His opinion of Louisa Musgrove's inferiority,



<P>an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give, his wonder



<P>at Captain Benwick, his feelings as to a first, strong attachment;



<P>sentences begun which he could not finish, his half averted eyes



<P>and more than half expressive glance, all, all declared that he had



<P>a heart returning to her at least; that anger, resentment, avoidance,



<P>were no more; and that they were succeeded, not merely by friendship



<P>and regard, but by the tenderness of the past.&nbsp; Yes, some share

of



<P>the tenderness of the past.&nbsp; She could not contemplate the change



<P>as implying less.&nbsp; He must love her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These were thoughts, with their attendant visions, which occupied



<P>and flurried her too much to leave her any power of observation;



<P>and she passed along the room without having a glimpse of him,



<P>without even trying to discern him.&nbsp; When their places were determined

on,



<P>and they were all properly arranged, she looked round to see



<P>if he should happen to be in the same part of the room, but he was not;



<P>her eye could not reach him; and the concert being just opening,



<P>she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches:



<P>Anne was among those on the foremost, and Mr Elliot had manoeuvred so

well,



<P>with the assistance of his friend Colonel Wallis, as to have a seat

by her.



<P>Miss Elliot, surrounded by her cousins, and the principal object



<P>of Colonel Wallis's gallantry, was quite contented.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne's mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment



<P>of the evening; it was just occupation enough:&nbsp; she had feelings

for



<P>the tender, spirits for the gay, attention for the scientific,



<P>and patience for the wearisome; and had never liked a concert better,



<P>at least during the first act.&nbsp; Towards the close of it,



<P>in the interval succeeding an Italian song, she explained



<P>the words of the song to Mr Elliot.&nbsp; They had a concert bill between

them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This," said she, "is nearly the sense, or rather the meaning of the

words,



<P>for certainly the sense of an Italian love-song must not be talked of,



<P>but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give; for I do not pretend



<P>to understand the language.&nbsp; I am a very poor Italian scholar."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, yes, I see you are.&nbsp; I see you know nothing of the matter.



<P>You have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight



<P>these inverted, transposed, curtailed Italian lines, into clear,



<P>comprehensible, elegant English.&nbsp; You need not say anything more



<P>of your ignorance.&nbsp; Here is complete proof."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I will not oppose such kind politeness; but I should be sorry to be



<P>examined by a real proficient."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long,"



<P>replied he, "without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot;



<P>and I do regard her as one who is too modest for the world in general



<P>to be aware of half her accomplishments, and too highly accomplished



<P>for modesty to be natural in any other woman."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"For shame! for shame! this is too much flattery.&nbsp; I forget what

we are



<P>to have next," turning to the bill.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Perhaps," said Mr Elliot, speaking low, "I have had a longer acquaintance



<P>with your character than you are aware of."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed!&nbsp; How so?&nbsp; You can have been acquainted with it only

since



<P>I came to Bath, excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of



<P>in my own family."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I knew you by report long before you came to Bath.&nbsp; I had heard

you



<P>described by those who knew you intimately.&nbsp; I have been acquainted



<P>with you by character many years.&nbsp; Your person, your disposition,



<P>accomplishments, manner; they were all present to me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he hoped to raise.



<P>No one can withstand the charm of such a mystery.&nbsp; To have been



<P>described long ago to a recent acquaintance, by nameless people,



<P>is irresistible; and Anne was all curiosity.&nbsp; She wondered,



<P>and questioned him eagerly; but in vain.&nbsp; He delighted in being

asked,



<P>but he would not tell.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, no, some time or other, perhaps, but not now.&nbsp; He would mention



<P>no names now; but such, he could assure her, had been the fact.



<P>He had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot



<P>as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit, and excited



<P>the warmest curiosity to know her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with



<P>partiality of her many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford,



<P>Captain Wentworth's brother.&nbsp; He might have been in Mr Elliot's

company,



<P>but she had not courage to ask the question.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The name of Anne Elliot," said he, "has long had an interesting sound

to me.



<P>Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if I dared,



<P>I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Such, she believed, were his words; but scarcely had she



<P>received their sound, than her attention was caught by other sounds



<P>immediately behind her, which rendered every thing else trivial.



<P>Her father and Lady Dalrymple were speaking.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A well-looking man," said Sir Walter, "a very well-looking man."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A very fine young man indeed!" said Lady Dalrymple.&nbsp; "More air



<P>than one often sees in Bath.&nbsp; Irish, I dare say."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I just know his name.&nbsp; A bowing acquaintance.&nbsp; Wentworth;



<P>Captain Wentworth of the navy.&nbsp; His sister married my tenant



<P>in Somersetshire, the Croft, who rents Kellynch."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Before Sir Walter had reached this point, Anne's eyes had caught



<P>the right direction, and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing



<P>among a cluster of men at a little distance.&nbsp; As her eyes fell

on him,



<P>his seemed to be withdrawn from her.&nbsp; It had that appearance.



<P>It seemed as if she had been one moment too late; and as long as she



<P>dared observe, he did not look again:&nbsp; but the performance



<P>was recommencing, and she was forced to seem to restore her attention



<P>to the orchestra and look straight forward.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When she could give another glance, he had moved away.&nbsp; He could

not have



<P>come nearer to her if he would; she was so surrounded and shut in:



<P>but she would rather have caught his eye.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr Elliot's speech, too, distressed her.&nbsp; She had no longer



<P>any inclination to talk to him.&nbsp; She wished him not so near her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The first act was over.&nbsp; Now she hoped for some beneficial change;



<P>and, after a period of nothing-saying amongst the party, some of them



<P>did decide on going in quest of tea.&nbsp; Anne was one of the few who



<P>did not choose to move.&nbsp; She remained in her seat, and so did Lady

Russell;



<P>but she had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot; and she did not

mean,



<P>whatever she might feel on Lady Russell's account, to shrink from



<P>conversation with Captain Wentworth, if he gave her the opportunity.



<P>She was persuaded by Lady Russell's countenance that she had seen him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He did not come however.&nbsp; Anne sometimes fancied she discerned

him



<P>at a distance, but he never came.&nbsp; The anxious interval



<P>wore away unproductively.&nbsp; The others returned, the room filled

again,



<P>benches were reclaimed and repossessed, and another hour of pleasure



<P>or of penance was to be sat out, another hour of music was to give



<P>delight or the gapes, as real or affected taste for it prevailed.



<P>To Anne, it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation.



<P>She could not quit that room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth



<P>once more, without the interchange of one friendly look.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In re-settling themselves there were now many changes, the result of

which



<P>was favourable for her.&nbsp; Colonel Wallis declined sitting down again,



<P>and Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret, in a manner



<P>not to be refused, to sit between them; and by some other removals,



<P>and a little scheming of her own,&nbsp; Anne was enabled to place herself



<P>much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before,



<P>much more within reach of a passer-by.&nbsp; She could not do so,



<P>without comparing herself with Miss Larolles, the inimitable Miss Larolles;



<P>but still she did it, and not with much happier effect;



<P>though by what seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication



<P>in her next neighbours, she found herself at the very end of the bench



<P>before the concert closed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Such was her situation, with a vacant space at hand, when Captain Wentworth



<P>was again in sight.&nbsp; She saw him not far off.&nbsp; He saw her

too;



<P>yet he looked grave, and seemed irresolute, and only by very slow degrees



<P>came at last near enough to speak to her.&nbsp; She felt that something



<P>must be the matter.&nbsp; The change was indubitable.&nbsp; The difference



<P>between his present air and what it had been in the Octagon Room



<P>was strikingly great.&nbsp; Why was it?&nbsp; She thought of her father,



<P>of Lady Russell.&nbsp; Could there have been any unpleasant glances?



<P>He began by speaking of the concert gravely, more like the Captain



<P>Wentworth of Uppercross; owned himself disappointed, had expected singing;



<P>and in short, must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over.



<P>Anne replied, and spoke in defense of the performance so well,



<P>and yet in allowance for his feelings so pleasantly, that his countenance



<P>improved, and he replied again with almost a smile.&nbsp; They talked



<P>for a few minutes more; the improvement held; he even looked down



<P>towards the bench, as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying;



<P>when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round.



<P>It came from Mr Elliot.&nbsp; He begged her pardon, but she must be

applied to,



<P>to explain Italian again.&nbsp; Miss Carteret was very anxious to have



<P>a general idea of what was next to be sung.&nbsp; Anne could not refuse;



<P>but never had she sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A few minutes, though as few as possible, were inevitably consumed;



<P>and when her own mistress again, when able to turn and look



<P>as she had done before, she found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth,



<P>in a reserved yet hurried sort of farewell.&nbsp; "He must wish her

good night;



<P>he was going; he should get home as fast as he could."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Is not this song worth staying for?" said Anne, suddenly struck



<P>by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No!" he replied impressively, "there is nothing worth my staying for;"



<P>and he was gone directly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jealousy of Mr Elliot!&nbsp; It was the only intelligible motive.



<P>Captain Wentworth jealous of her affection!&nbsp; Could she have believed

it



<P>a week ago; three hours ago!&nbsp; For a moment the gratification was

exquisite.



<P>But, alas! there were very different thoughts to succeed.



<P>How was such jealousy to be quieted?&nbsp; How was the truth to reach

him?



<P>How, in all the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations,



<P>would he ever learn of her real sentiments?&nbsp; It was misery to think



<P>of Mr Elliot's attentions.&nbsp; Their evil was incalculable.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>From this time Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly



<P>in the same circle.&nbsp; They were soon dining in company together



<P>at Mr Musgrove's, for the little boy's state could no longer



<P>supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself; and this was



<P>but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof;



<P>former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each;



<P>they could not but be reverted to; the year of their engagement



<P>could not but be named by him, in the little narratives or descriptions



<P>which conversation called forth.&nbsp; His profession qualified him,



<P>his disposition lead him, to talk; and "That was in the year six;"



<P>"That happened before I went to sea in the year six," occurred



<P>in the course of the first evening they spent together:



<P>and though his voice did not falter, and though she had no reason



<P>to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke,



<P>Anne felt the utter impossibility, from her knowledge of his mind,



<P>that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself.



<P>There must be the same immediate association of thought,



<P>though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They had no conversation together, no intercourse but what



<P>the commonest civility required.&nbsp; Once so much to each other!



<P>Now nothing!&nbsp; There had been a time, when of all the large party



<P>now filling the drawing-room at Uppercross, they would have found it



<P>most difficult to cease to speak to one another.&nbsp; With the exception,



<P>perhaps, of Admiral and Mrs Croft, who seemed particularly attached



<P>and happy, (Anne could allow no other exceptions even among



<P>the married couples), there could have been no two hearts so open,



<P>no tastes so similar, no feelings so in unison, no countenances so beloved.



<P>Now they were as strangers; nay, worse than strangers, for they could



<P>never become acquainted.&nbsp; It was a perpetual estrangement.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When he talked, she heard the same voice, and discerned the same mind.



<P>There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the

party;



<P>and he was very much questioned, and especially by the two Miss Musgroves,



<P>who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him, as to the manner



<P>of living on board, daily regulations, food, hours, &amp;c., and their

surprise



<P>at his accounts, at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement



<P>which was practicable, drew from him some pleasant ridicule,



<P>which reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant,



<P>and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board



<P>without anything to eat, or any cook to dress it if there were,



<P>or any servant to wait, or any knife and fork to use.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>From thus listening and thinking, she was roused by a whisper



<P>of Mrs Musgrove's who, overcome by fond regrets, could not help saying--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! Miss Anne, if it had pleased Heaven to spare my poor son,



<P>I dare say he would have been just such another by this time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne suppressed a smile, and listened kindly, while Mrs Musgrove



<P>relieved her heart a little more; and for a few minutes, therefore,



<P>could not keep pace with the conversation of the others.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When she could let her attention take its natural course again,



<P>she found the Miss Musgroves just fetching the Navy List



<P>(their own navy list, the first that had ever been at Uppercross),



<P>and sitting down together to pore over it, with the professed view



<P>of finding out the ships that Captain Wentworth had commanded.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your first was the Asp, I remember; we will look for the Asp."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You will not find her there.&nbsp; Quite worn out and broken up.



<P>I was the last man who commanded her.&nbsp; Hardly fit for service then.



<P>Reported fit for home service for a year or two, and so I was sent off



<P>to the West Indies."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The girls looked all amazement.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The Admiralty," he continued, "entertain themselves now and then,



<P>with sending a few hundred men to sea, in a ship not fit to be employed.



<P>But they have a great many to provide for; and among the thousands



<P>that may just as well go to the bottom as not, it is impossible



<P>for them to distinguish the very set who may be least missed."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Phoo! phoo!" cried the Admiral, "what stuff these young fellows talk!



<P>Never was a better sloop than the Asp in her day.&nbsp; For an old built

sloop,



<P>you would not see her equal.&nbsp; Lucky fellow to get her!&nbsp; He

knows there



<P>must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her



<P>at the same time.&nbsp; Lucky fellow to get anything so soon,



<P>with no more interest than his."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I felt my luck, Admiral, I assure you;" replied Captain Wentworth,



<P>seriously.&nbsp; "I was as well satisfied with my appointment as you

can desire.



<P>It was a great object with me at that time to be at sea;



<P>a very great object, I wanted to be doing something."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To be sure you did.&nbsp; What should a young fellow like you do ashore



<P>for half a year together?&nbsp; If a man had not a wife, he soon wants



<P>to be afloat again."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But, Captain Wentworth," cried Louisa, "how vexed you must have been



<P>when you came to the Asp, to see what an old thing they had given you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I knew pretty well what she was before that day;" said he, smiling.



<P>"I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to



<P>the fashion and strength of any old pelisse, which you had seen



<P>lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember,



<P>and which at last, on some very wet day, is lent to yourself.



<P>Ah! she was a dear old Asp to me.&nbsp; She did all that I wanted.



<P>I knew she would.&nbsp; I knew that we should either go to the bottom

together,



<P>or that she would be the making of me; and I never had two days



<P>of foul weather all the time I was at sea in her; and after



<P>taking privateers enough to be very entertaining, I had the good luck



<P>in my passage home the next autumn, to fall in with the very French

frigate



<P>I wanted.&nbsp; I brought her into Plymouth; and here another instance

of luck.



<P>We had not been six hours in the Sound, when a gale came on,



<P>which lasted four days and nights, and which would have done for



<P>poor old Asp in half the time; our touch with the Great Nation



<P>not having much improved our condition.&nbsp; Four-and-twenty hours

later,



<P>and I should only have been a gallant Captain Wentworth,



<P>in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers; and being lost



<P>in only a sloop, nobody would have thought about me." Anne's shudderings



<P>were to herself alone; but the Miss Musgroves could be as open



<P>as they were sincere, in their exclamations of pity and horror.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And so then, I suppose," said Mrs Musgrove, in a low voice,



<P>as if thinking aloud, "so then he went away to the Laconia, and there



<P>he met with our poor boy. Charles, my dear," (beckoning him to her),



<P>"do ask Captain Wentworth where it was he first met with your poor brother.



<P>I always forgot."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It was at Gibraltar, mother, I know.&nbsp; Dick had been left ill at

Gibraltar,



<P>with a recommendation from his former captain to Captain Wentworth."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! but, Charles, tell Captain Wentworth, he need not be afraid



<P>of mentioning poor Dick before me, for it would be rather a pleasure



<P>to hear him talked of by such a good friend."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Charles, being somewhat more mindful of the probabilities of the case,



<P>only nodded in reply, and walked away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The girls were now hunting for the Laconia; and Captain Wentworth



<P>could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume



<P>into his own hands to save them the trouble, and once more read aloud



<P>the little statement of her name and rate, and present



<P>non-commissioned class, observing over it that she too had been



<P>one of the best friends man ever had.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia!&nbsp; How fast

I



<P>made money in her.&nbsp; A friend of mine and I had such a lovely cruise



<P>together off the Western Islands.&nbsp; Poor Harville, sister!



<P>You know how much he wanted money:&nbsp; worse than myself.&nbsp; He

had a wife.



<P>Excellent fellow.&nbsp; I shall never forget his happiness.&nbsp; He

felt it all,



<P>so much for her sake.&nbsp; I wished for him again the next summer,



<P>when I had still the same luck in the Mediterranean."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And I am sure, Sir." said Mrs Musgrove, "it was a lucky day for us,



<P>when you were put captain into that ship.&nbsp; We shall never forget



<P>what you did."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her feelings made her speak low; and Captain Wentworth,



<P>hearing only in part, and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all



<P>near his thoughts, looked rather in suspense, and as if waiting for

more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My brother," whispered one of the girls; "mamma is thinking



<P>of poor Richard."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Poor dear fellow!" continued Mrs Musgrove; "he was grown so steady,



<P>and such an excellent correspondent, while he was under your care!



<P>Ah! it would have been a happy thing, if he had never left you.



<P>I assure you, Captain Wentworth, we are very sorry he ever left you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth's face at this

speech,



<P>a certain glance of his bright eye, and curl of his handsome mouth,



<P>which convinced Anne, that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove's kind

wishes,



<P>as to her son, he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him;



<P>but it was too transient an indulgence of self-amusement to be detected



<P>by any who understood him less than herself; in another moment



<P>he was perfectly collected and serious, and almost instantly afterwards



<P>coming up to the sofa, on which she and Mrs Musgrove were sitting,



<P>took a place by the latter, and entered into conversation with her,



<P>in a low voice, about her son, doing it with so much sympathy



<P>and natural grace, as shewed the kindest consideration for all



<P>that was real and unabsurd in the parent's feelings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They were actually on the same sofa, for Mrs Musgrove had



<P>most readily made room for him; they were divided only by Mrs Musgrove.



<P>It was no insignificant barrier, indeed.&nbsp; Mrs Musgrove was of



<P>a comfortable, substantial size, infinitely more fitted by nature



<P>to express good cheer and good humour, than tenderness and sentiment;



<P>and while the agitations of Anne's slender form, and pensive face,



<P>may be considered as very completely screened, Captain Wentworth



<P>should be allowed some credit for the self-command with which



<P>he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son,



<P>whom alive nobody had cared for.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions.



<P>A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction,



<P>as the most graceful set of limbs in the world.&nbsp; But, fair or not

fair,



<P>there are unbecoming conjunctions, which reason will patronize in vain--



<P>which taste cannot tolerate--which ridicule will seize.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Admiral, after taking two or three refreshing turns about the room



<P>with his hands behind him, being called to order by his wife,



<P>now came up to Captain Wentworth, and without any observation



<P>of what he might be interrupting, thinking only of his own thoughts,



<P>began with--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If you had been a week later at Lisbon, last spring, Frederick,



<P>you would have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson



<P>and her daughters."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Should I?&nbsp; I am glad I was not a week later then."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Admiral abused him for his want of gallantry.&nbsp; He defended

himself;



<P>though professing that he would never willingly admit any ladies



<P>on board a ship of his, excepting for a ball, or a visit,



<P>which a few hours might comprehend.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But, if I know myself," said he, "this is from no want of gallantry



<P>towards them.&nbsp; It is rather from feeling how impossible it is,



<P>with all one's efforts, and all one's sacrifices, to make



<P>the accommodations on board such as women ought to have.



<P>There can be no want of gallantry, Admiral, in rating the claims of

women



<P>to every personal comfort high, and this is what I do.&nbsp; I hate

to hear



<P>of women on board, or to see them on board; and no ship under my command



<P>shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere, if I can help it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This brought his sister upon him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! Frederick!&nbsp; But I cannot believe it of you. --All idle refinement!



<P>--Women may be as comfortable on board, as in the best house in England.



<P>I believe I have lived as much on board as most women, and I know



<P>nothing superior to the accommodations of a man-of-war.&nbsp; I declare



<P>I have not a comfort or an indulgence about me, even at Kellynch Hall,"



<P>(with a kind bow to Anne), "beyond what I always had in most of



<P>the ships I have lived in; and they have been five altogether."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nothing to the purpose," replied her brother.&nbsp; "You were living



<P>with your husband, and were the only woman on board."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But you, yourself, brought Mrs Harville, her sister, her cousin,



<P>and three children, round from Portsmouth to Plymouth.&nbsp; Where was

this



<P>superfine, extraordinary sort of gallantry of yours then?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"All merged in my friendship, Sophia.&nbsp; I would assist any



<P>brother officer's wife that I could, and I would bring anything



<P>of Harville's from the world's end, if he wanted it.&nbsp; But do not

imagine



<P>that I did not feel it an evil in itself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Depend upon it, they were all perfectly comfortable."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I might not like them the better for that perhaps.&nbsp; Such a number



<P>of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Frederick, you are talking quite idly.&nbsp; Pray, what would



<P>become of us poor sailors' wives, who often want to be conveyed to



<P>one port or another, after our husbands, if everybody had your feelings?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My feelings, you see, did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville



<P>and all her family to Plymouth."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman,



<P>and as if women were all fine ladies, instead of rational creatures.



<P>We none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! my dear," said the Admiral, "when he had got a wife,



<P>he will sing a different tune.&nbsp; When he is married, if we have



<P>the good luck to live to another war, we shall see him do as you and

I,



<P>and a great many others, have done.&nbsp; We shall have him very thankful



<P>to anybody that will bring him his wife."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ay, that we shall."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now I have done," cried Captain Wentworth.&nbsp; "When once married



<P>people begin to attack me with,--`Oh! you will think very differently,



<P>when you are married.'&nbsp; I can only say, `No, I shall not;' and

then



<P>they say again, `Yes, you will,' and there is an end of it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He got up and moved away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What a great traveller you must have been, ma'am!" said Mrs Musgrove



<P>to Mrs Croft.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Pretty well, ma'am in the fifteen years of my marriage;



<P>though many women have done more.&nbsp; I have crossed the Atlantic



<P>four times, and have been once to the East Indies, and back again,



<P>and only once; besides being in different places about home:



<P>Cork, and Lisbon, and Gibraltar.&nbsp; But I never went beyond the Streights,



<P>and never was in the West Indies.&nbsp; We do not call Bermuda or Bahama,



<P>you know, the West Indies."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs Musgrove had not a word to say in dissent; she could not accuse

herself



<P>of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And I do assure you, ma'am," pursued Mrs Croft, "that nothing can exceed



<P>the accommodations of a man-of-war; I speak, you know, of the higher

rates.



<P>When you come to a frigate, of course, you are more confined;



<P>though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them;



<P>and I can safely say, that the happiest part of my life has been spent



<P>on board a ship.&nbsp; While we were together, you know, there was nothing



<P>to be feared.&nbsp; Thank God!&nbsp; I have always been blessed with



<P>excellent health, and no climate disagrees with me.&nbsp; A little disordered



<P>always the first twenty-four hours of going to sea, but never knew



<P>what sickness was afterwards.&nbsp; The only time I ever really suffered



<P>in body or mind, the only time that I ever fancied myself unwell,



<P>or had any ideas of danger, was the winter that I passed by myself at

Deal,



<P>when the Admiral (Captain Croft then) was in the North Seas.



<P>I lived in perpetual fright at that time, and had all manner of



<P>imaginary complaints from not knowing what to do with myself,



<P>or when I should hear from him next; but as long as we could be together,



<P>nothing ever ailed me, and I never met with the smallest inconvenience."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Aye, to be sure.&nbsp; Yes, indeed, oh yes!&nbsp; I am quite of your

opinion,



<P>Mrs Croft," was Mrs Musgrove's hearty answer.&nbsp; "There is nothing

so bad



<P>as a separation.&nbsp; I am quite of your opinion.&nbsp; I know what

it is,



<P>for Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes, and I am so glad when



<P>they are over, and he is safe back again."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The evening ended with dancing.&nbsp; On its being proposed,



<P>Anne offered her services, as usual; and though her eyes would sometimes



<P>fill with tears as she sat at the instrument, she was extremely glad



<P>to be employed, and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was a merry, joyous party, and no one seemed in higher spirits



<P>than Captain Wentworth.&nbsp; She felt that he had every thing to elevate



<P>him which general attention and deference, and especially the attention



<P>of all the young women, could do.&nbsp; The Miss Hayters, the females



<P>of the family of cousins already mentioned, were apparently admitted



<P>to the honour of being in love with him; and as for Henrietta and Louisa,



<P>they both seemed so entirely occupied by him, that nothing but



<P>the continued appearance of the most perfect good-will between themselves



<P>could have made it credible that they were not decided rivals.



<P>If he were a little spoilt by such universal, such eager admiration,



<P>who could wonder?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne, while her fingers



<P>were mechanically at work, proceeding for half an hour together,



<P>equally without error, and without consciousness.&nbsp; Once she felt



<P>that he was looking at herself,&nbsp; observing her altered features,



<P>perhaps, trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once



<P>charmed him; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her;



<P>she was hardly aware of it, till she heard the answer; but then she

was



<P>sure of his having asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced?



<P>The answer was, "Oh, no; never; she has quite given up dancing.



<P>She had rather play.&nbsp; She is never tired of playing."&nbsp; Once,

too,



<P>he spoke to her.&nbsp; She had left the instrument on the dancing being

over,



<P>and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished



<P>to give the Miss Musgroves an idea of.&nbsp; Unintentionally she returned



<P>to that part of the room; he saw her, and, instantly rising,



<P>said, with studied politeness--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I beg your pardon, madam, this is your seat;" and though she immediately



<P>drew back with a decided negative, he was not to be induced



<P>to sit down again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches.



<P>His cold politeness, his ceremonious grace, were worse than anything.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Captain Wentworth was come to Kellynch as to a home, to stay



<P>as long as he liked, being as thoroughly the object of



<P>the Admiral's fraternal kindness as of his wife's.&nbsp; He had intended,



<P>on first arriving, to proceed very soon into Shropshire,



<P>and visit the brother settled in that country, but the attractions



<P>of Uppercross induced him to put this off.&nbsp; There was so much



<P>of friendliness, and of flattery, and of everything most bewitching



<P>in his reception there; the old were so hospitable, the young so agreeable,



<P>that he could not but resolve to remain where he was, and take all



<P>the charms and perfections of Edward's wife upon credit a little longer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was soon Uppercross with him almost every day.&nbsp; The Musgroves



<P>could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come, particularly



<P>in the morning, when he had no companion at home, for the Admiral



<P>and Mrs Croft were generally out of doors together, interesting themselves



<P>in their new possessions, their grass, and their sheep, and dawdling

about



<P>in a way not endurable to a third person, or driving out in a gig,



<P>lately added to their establishment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Hitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth



<P>among the Musgroves and their dependencies.&nbsp; It was unvarying,



<P>warm admiration everywhere; but this intimate footing was not more



<P>than established, when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them,



<P>to be a good deal disturbed by it, and to think Captain Wentworth



<P>very much in the way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Charles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins, and a very amiable,



<P>pleasing young man, between whom and Henrietta there had been



<P>a considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth's



<P>introduction.&nbsp; He was in orders; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood,



<P>where residence was not required, lived at his father's house,



<P>only two miles from Uppercross.&nbsp; A short absence from home



<P>had left his fair one unguarded by his attentions at this critical period,



<P>and when he came back he had the pain of finding very altered manners,



<P>and of seeing Captain Wentworth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters.&nbsp; They had each had money,



<P>but their marriages had made a material difference in



<P>their degree of consequence.&nbsp; Mr Hayter had some property of his

own,



<P>but it was insignificant compared with Mr Musgrove's; and while



<P>the Musgroves were in the first class of society in the country,



<P>the young Hayters would, from their parents' inferior, retired,



<P>and unpolished way of living, and their own defective education,



<P>have been hardly in any class at all, but for their connexion



<P>with Uppercross, this eldest son of course excepted, who had chosen



<P>to be a scholar and a gentleman, and who was very superior



<P>in cultivation and manners to all the rest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The two families had always been on excellent terms, there being no

pride



<P>on one side, and no envy on the other, and only such a consciousness



<P>of superiority in the Miss Musgroves, as made them pleased



<P>to improve their cousins.&nbsp; Charles's attentions to Henrietta



<P>had been observed by her father and mother without any disapprobation.



<P>"It would not be a great match for her; but if Henrietta liked him,"--



<P>and Henrietta did seem to like him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Henrietta fully thought so herself, before Captain Wentworth came;



<P>but from that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Which of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was



<P>as yet quite doubtful, as far as Anne's observation reached.



<P>Henrietta was perhaps the prettiest, Louisa had the higher spirits;



<P>and she knew not now, whether the more gentle or the more lively character



<P>were most likely to attract him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr and Mrs Musgrove, either from seeing little, or from



<P>an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters,



<P>and of all the young men who came near them, seemed to leave everything



<P>to take its chance.&nbsp; There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude



<P>or remark about them in the Mansion-house; but it was different



<P>at the Cottage:&nbsp; the young couple there were more disposed



<P>to speculate and wonder; and Captain Wentworth had not been above



<P>four or five times in the Miss Musgroves' company, and Charles Hayter



<P>had but just reappeared, when Anne had to listen to the opinions



<P>of her brother and sister, as to which was the one liked best.



<P>Charles gave it for Louisa, Mary for Henrietta, but quite agreeing



<P>that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Charles "had never seen a pleasanter man in his life; and from what



<P>he had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say, was very sure that



<P>he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war.



<P>Here was a fortune at once; besides which, there would be the chance



<P>of what might be done in any future war; and he was sure Captain Wentworth



<P>was as likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy.



<P>Oh! it would be a capital match for either of his sisters."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Upon my word it would," replied Mary.&nbsp; "Dear me!&nbsp; If he should



<P>rise to any very great honours!&nbsp; If he should ever be made a baronet!



<P>`Lady Wentworth' sounds very well.&nbsp; That would be a noble thing,



<P>indeed, for Henrietta!&nbsp; She would take place of me then, and Henrietta



<P>would not dislike that.&nbsp; Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth!



<P>It would be but a new creation, however, and I never think much



<P>of your new creations."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred



<P>on the very account of Charles Hayter, whose pretensions she wished



<P>to see put an end to.&nbsp; She looked down very decidedly upon the

Hayters,



<P>and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection



<P>between the families renewed--very sad for herself and her children.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You know," said she, "I cannot think him at all a fit match for Henrietta;



<P>and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made,



<P>she has no right to throw herself away.&nbsp; I do not think any young

woman



<P>has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient



<P>to the principal part of her family, and be giving bad connections



<P>to those who have not been used to them.&nbsp; And, pray, who is Charles

Hayter?



<P>Nothing but a country curate.&nbsp; A most improper match for Miss Musgrove



<P>of Uppercross.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her husband, however, would not agree with her here; for besides having



<P>a regard for his cousin, Charles Hayter was an eldest son,



<P>and he saw things as an eldest son himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now you are taking nonsense, Mary," was therefore his answer.



<P>"It would not be a great match for Henrietta, but Charles has



<P>a very fair chance, through the Spicers, of getting something from



<P>the Bishop in the course of a year or two; and you will please to remember,



<P>that he is the eldest son; whenever my uncle dies, he steps into very



<P>pretty property.&nbsp; The estate at Winthrop is not less than



<P>two hundred and fifty acres, besides the farm near Taunton,



<P>which is some of the best land in the country.&nbsp; I grant you,



<P>that any of them but Charles would be a very shocking match for Henrietta,



<P>and indeed it could not be; he is the only one that could be possible;



<P>but he is a very good-natured, good sort of a fellow; and whenever Winthrop



<P>comes into his hands, he will make a different sort of place of it,



<P>and live in a very different sort of way; and with that property,



<P>he will never be a contemptible man--good, freehold property.&nbsp;

No, no;



<P>Henrietta might do worse than marry Charles Hayter; and if she has him,



<P>and Louisa can get Captain Wentworth, I shall be very well satisfied."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Charles may say what he pleases," cried Mary to Anne, as soon as



<P>he was out of the room, "but it would be shocking to have Henrietta



<P>marry Charles Hayter; a very bad thing for her, and still worse



<P>for me; and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth



<P>may soon put him quite out of her head, and I have very little doubt



<P>that he has.&nbsp; She took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday.



<P>I wish you had been there to see her behaviour.&nbsp; And as to



<P>Captain Wentworth's liking Louisa as well as Henrietta, it is nonsense



<P>to say so; for he certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best.



<P>But Charles is so positive!&nbsp; I wish you had been with us yesterday,



<P>for then you might have decided between us; and I am sure you



<P>would have thought as I did, unless you had been determined



<P>to give it against me.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A dinner at Mr Musgrove's had been the occasion when all these things



<P>should have been seen by Anne; but she had staid at home,



<P>under the mixed plea of a headache of her own, and some return



<P>of indisposition in little Charles.&nbsp; She had thought only of avoiding



<P>Captain Wentworth; but an escape from being appealed to as umpire



<P>was now added to the advantages of a quiet evening.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As to Captain Wentworth's views, she deemed it of more consequence



<P>that he should know his own mind early enough not to be endangering



<P>the happiness of either sister, or impeaching his own honour,



<P>than that he should prefer Henrietta to Louisa, or Louisa to Henrietta.



<P>Either of them would, in all probability, make him an affectionate,



<P>good-humoured wife.&nbsp; With regard to Charles Hayter, she had delicacy



<P>which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning



<P>young woman, and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings



<P>it occasioned; but if Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature



<P>of her feelings, the alternation could not be understood too soon.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Charles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him



<P>in his cousin's behaviour.&nbsp; She had too old a regard for him



<P>to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish



<P>every past hope, and leave him nothing to do but to keep away



<P>from Uppercross:&nbsp; but there was such a change as became very alarming,



<P>when such a man as Captain Wentworth was to be regarded as



<P>the probable cause.&nbsp; He had been absent only two Sundays,



<P>and when they parted, had left her interested, even to the height



<P>of his wishes, in his prospect of soon quitting his present curacy,



<P>and obtaining that of Uppercross instead.&nbsp; It had then seemed the

object



<P>nearest her heart, that Dr Shirley, the rector, who for more than



<P>forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties of his office,



<P>but was now growing too infirm for many of them, should be quite fixed



<P>on engaging a curate; should make his curacy quite as good



<P>as he could afford, and should give Charles Hayter the promise of it.



<P>The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross, instead of going



<P>six miles another way; of his having, in every respect, a better curacy;



<P>of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley, and of dear, good Dr Shirley's



<P>being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through



<P>without most injurious fatigue, had been a great deal, even to Louisa,



<P>but had been almost everything to Henrietta.&nbsp; When he came back,

alas!



<P>the zeal of the business was gone by.&nbsp; Louisa could not listen

at all



<P>to his account of a conversation which he had just held with Dr Shirley:



<P>she was at a window, looking out for Captain Wentworth; and even Henrietta



<P>had at best only a divided attention to give, and seemed to have forgotten



<P>all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I am very glad indeed:&nbsp; but I always thought you would have

it;



<P>I always thought you sure.&nbsp; It did not appear to me that--in short,



<P>you know, Dr Shirley must have a curate, and you had secured his promise.



<P>Is he coming, Louisa?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One morning, very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves,



<P>at which Anne had not been present, Captain Wentworth walked into



<P>the drawing-room at the Cottage, where were only herself and the little



<P>invalid Charles, who was lying on the sofa.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot,



<P>deprived his manners of their usual composure:&nbsp; he started,



<P>and could only say, "I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here:



<P>Mrs Musgrove told me I should find them here," before he walked



<P>to the window to recollect himself, and feel how he ought to behave.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They are up stairs with my sister:&nbsp; they will be down in a few

moments,



<P>I dare say," had been Anne's reply, in all the confusion that was natural;



<P>and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him,



<P>she would have been out of the room the next moment, and released



<P>Captain Wentworth as well as herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He continued at the window; and after calmly and politely saying,



<P>"I hope the little boy is better," was silent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was obliged to kneel down by the sofa, and remain there



<P>to satisfy her patient; and thus they continued a few minutes,



<P>when, to her very great satisfaction, she heard some other person



<P>crossing the little vestibule.&nbsp; She hoped, on turning her head,



<P>to see the master of the house; but it proved to be one



<P>much less calculated for making matters easy--Charles Hayter,



<P>probably not at all better pleased by the sight of Captain Wentworth



<P>than Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of Anne.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She only attempted to say, "How do you do?&nbsp; Will you not sit down?



<P>The others will be here presently."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Captain Wentworth, however, came from his window, apparently



<P>not ill-disposed for conversation; but Charles Hayter soon put an end



<P>to his attempts by seating himself near the table, and taking up



<P>the newspaper; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Another minute brought another addition.&nbsp; The younger boy,



<P>a remarkable stout, forward child, of two years old, having got the

door



<P>opened for him by some one without, made his determined appearance



<P>among them, and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on,



<P>and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There being nothing to eat, he could only have some play;



<P>and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother,



<P>he began to fasten himself upon her, as she knelt, in such a way that,



<P>busy as she was about Charles, she could not shake him off.



<P>She spoke to him, ordered, entreated, and insisted in vain.



<P>Once she did contrive to push him away, but the boy had



<P>the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Walter," said she, "get down this moment.&nbsp; You are extremely troublesome.



<P>I am very angry with you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Walter," cried Charles Hayter, "why do you not do as you are bid?



<P>Do not you hear your aunt speak?&nbsp; Come to me, Walter, come to



<P>cousin Charles."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But not a bit did Walter stir.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In another moment, however, she found herself in the state of



<P>being released from him; some one was taking him from her,



<P>though he had bent down her head so much, that his little sturdy hands



<P>were unfastened from around her neck, and he was resolutely borne away,



<P>before she knew that Captain Wentworth had done it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless.



<P>She could not even thank him.&nbsp; She could only hang over little

Charles,



<P>with most disordered feelings.&nbsp; His kindness in stepping forward



<P>to her relief, the manner, the silence in which it had passed,



<P>the little particulars of the circumstance, with the conviction soon



<P>forced on her by the noise he was studiously making with the child,



<P>that he meant to avoid hearing her thanks, and rather sought



<P>to testify that her conversation was the last of his wants,



<P>produced such a confusion of varying, but very painful agitation,



<P>as she could not recover from, till enabled by the entrance of Mary



<P>and the Miss Musgroves to make over her little patient to their cares,



<P>and leave the room.&nbsp; She could not stay.&nbsp; It might have been



<P>an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four--



<P>they were now altogether; but she could stay for none of it.



<P>It was evident that Charles Hayter was not well inclined towards



<P>Captain Wentworth.&nbsp; She had a strong impression of his having said,



<P>in a vext tone of voice, after Captain Wentworth's interference,



<P>"You ought to have minded me, Walter; I told you not to teaze your aunt;"



<P>and could comprehend his regretting that Captain Wentworth should do



<P>what he ought to have done himself.&nbsp; But neither Charles Hayter's

feelings,



<P>nor anybody's feelings, could interest her, till she had a little better



<P>arranged her own.&nbsp; She was ashamed of herself, quite ashamed



<P>of being so nervous, so overcome by such a trifle; but so it was,



<P>and it required a long application of solitude and reflection



<P>to recover her.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise



<P>of going to Mrs Smith, meaning that it should engage her from home



<P>at the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call; for to avoid



<P>Mr Elliot was almost a first object.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She felt a great deal of good-will towards him.&nbsp; In spite of



<P>the mischief of his attentions, she owed him gratitude and regard,



<P>perhaps compassion.&nbsp; She could not help thinking much of the extraordinary



<P>circumstances attending their acquaintance, of the right which



<P>he seemed to have to interest her, by everything in situation,



<P>by his own sentiments, by his early prepossession.&nbsp; It was altogether



<P>very extraordinary; flattering, but painful.&nbsp; There was much to

regret.



<P>How she might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case,



<P>was not worth enquiry; for there was a Captain Wentworth;



<P>and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad,



<P>her affection would be his for ever.&nbsp; Their union, she believed,



<P>could not divide her more from other men, than their final separation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Prettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancy,



<P>could never have passed along the streets of Bath, than Anne



<P>was sporting with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings.



<P>It was almost enough to spread purification and perfume all the way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was sure of a pleasant reception; and her friend seemed this morning



<P>particularly obliged to her for coming, seemed hardly to have expected

her,



<P>though it had been an appointment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>An account of the concert was immediately claimed; and Anne's recollections



<P>of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features



<P>and make her rejoice to talk of it.&nbsp; All that she could tell



<P>she told most gladly, but the all was little for one who had been there,



<P>and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Smith, who had



<P>already heard, through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter,



<P>rather more of the general success and produce of the evening



<P>than Anne could relate, and who now asked in vain for several particulars



<P>of the company.&nbsp; Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath



<P>was well know by name to Mrs Smith.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The little Durands were there, I conclude," said she, "with their mouths



<P>open to catch the music, like unfledged sparrows ready to be fed.



<P>They never miss a concert."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes; I did not see them myself, but I heard Mr Elliot say they were



<P>in the room."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The Ibbotsons, were they there? and the two new beauties,



<P>with the tall Irish officer, who is talked of for one of them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not know.&nbsp; I do not think they were."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Old Lady Mary Maclean?&nbsp; I need not ask after her.&nbsp; She never

misses,



<P>I know; and you must have seen her.&nbsp; She must have been in your

own circle;



<P>for as you went with Lady Dalrymple, you were in the seats of grandeur,



<P>round the orchestra, of course."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, that was what I dreaded.&nbsp; It would have been very unpleasant

to me



<P>in every respect.&nbsp; But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses



<P>to be farther off; and we were exceedingly well placed, that is,



<P>for hearing; I must not say for seeing, because I appear to have seen



<P>very little."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! you saw enough for your own amusement.&nbsp; I can understand.



<P>There is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd,



<P>and this you had.&nbsp; You were a large party in yourselves,



<P>and you wanted nothing beyond."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But I ought to have looked about me more," said Anne, conscious



<P>while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about,



<P>that the object only had been deficient.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, no; you were better employed.&nbsp; You need not tell me that you



<P>had a pleasant evening.&nbsp; I see it in your eye.&nbsp; I perfectly

see



<P>how the hours passed:&nbsp; that you had always something agreeable



<P>to listen to.&nbsp; In the intervals of the concert it was conversation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne half smiled and said, "Do you see that in my eye?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, I do.&nbsp; Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were



<P>in company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable



<P>in the world, the person who interests you at this present time



<P>more than all the rest of the world put together."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A blush overspread Anne's cheeks.&nbsp; She could say nothing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And such being the case," continued Mrs Smith, after a short pause,



<P>"I hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness



<P>in coming to me this morning.&nbsp; It is really very good of you



<P>to come and sit with me, when you must have so many pleasanter demands



<P>upon your time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne heard nothing of this.&nbsp; She was still in the astonishment

and



<P>confusion excited by her friend's penetration, unable to imagine



<P>how any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her.



<P>After another short silence--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Pray," said Mrs Smith, "is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with

me?



<P>Does he know that I am in Bath?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr Elliot!" repeated Anne, looking up surprised.&nbsp; A moment's reflection



<P>shewed her the mistake she had been under.&nbsp; She caught it instantaneously;



<P>and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety, soon added,



<P>more composedly, "Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have been a good deal acquainted with him," replied Mrs Smith, gravely,



<P>"but it seems worn out now.&nbsp; It is a great while since we met."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was not at all aware of this.&nbsp; You never mentioned it before.



<P>Had I known it, I would have had the pleasure of talking to him about

you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To confess the truth," said Mrs Smith, assuming her usual



<P>air of cheerfulness, "that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have.



<P>I want you to talk about me to Mr Elliot.&nbsp; I want your interest

with him.



<P>He can be of essential service to me; and if you would have the goodness,



<P>my dear Miss Elliot, to make it an object to yourself,



<P>of course it is done."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I should be extremely happy; I hope you cannot doubt my willingness



<P>to be of even the slightest use to you," replied Anne; "but I suspect



<P>that you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot,



<P>a greater right to influence him, than is really the case.



<P>I am sure you have, somehow or other, imbibed such a notion.



<P>You must consider me only as Mr Elliot's relation.&nbsp; If in that

light



<P>there is anything which you suppose his cousin might fairly ask of him,



<P>I beg you would not hesitate to employ me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs Smith gave her a penetrating glance, and then, smiling, said--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have been a little premature, I perceive; I beg your pardon.



<P>I ought to have waited for official information,&nbsp; But now, my dear



<P>Miss Elliot, as an old friend, do give me a hint as to when I may speak.



<P>Next week?&nbsp; To be sure by next week I may be allowed to



<P>think it all settled, and build my own selfish schemes on



<P>Mr Elliot's good fortune."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No," replied Anne, "nor next week, nor next, nor next.



<P>I assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of



<P>will be settled any week.&nbsp; I am not going to marry Mr Elliot.



<P>I should like to know why you imagine I am?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs Smith looked at her again, looked earnestly, smiled,



<P>shook her head, and exclaimed--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now, how I do wish I understood you!&nbsp; How I do wish I knew



<P>what you were at!&nbsp; I have a great idea that you do not design to

be cruel,



<P>when the right moment occurs.&nbsp; Till it does come, you know,



<P>we women never mean to have anybody.&nbsp; It is a thing of course among

us,



<P>that every man is refused, till he offers.&nbsp; But why should you

be cruel?



<P>Let me plead for my--present friend I cannot call him, but for



<P>my former friend.&nbsp; Where can you look for a more suitable match?



<P>Where could you expect a more gentlemanlike, agreeable man?



<P>Let me recommend Mr Elliot.&nbsp; I am sure you hear nothing but good

of him



<P>from Colonel Wallis; and who can know him better than Colonel Wallis?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Mrs Smith, Mr Elliot's wife has not been dead much above



<P>half a year.&nbsp; He ought not to be supposed to be paying his addresses



<P>to any one."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! if these are your only objections," cried Mrs Smith, archly,



<P>"Mr Elliot is safe, and I shall give myself no more trouble about him.



<P>Do not forget me when you are married, that's all.&nbsp; Let him know

me to be



<P>a friend of yours, and then he will think little of the trouble required,



<P>which it is very natural for him now, with so many affairs and engagements



<P>of his own, to avoid and get rid of as he can; very natural, perhaps.



<P>Ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same.&nbsp; Of course,



<P>he cannot be aware of the importance to me.&nbsp; Well, my dear Miss

Elliot,



<P>I hope and trust you will be very happy.&nbsp; Mr Elliot has sense



<P>to understand the value of such a woman.&nbsp; Your peace will not be



<P>shipwrecked as mine has been.&nbsp; You are safe in all worldly matters,



<P>and safe in his character.&nbsp; He will not be led astray; he will

not be



<P>misled by others to his ruin."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No," said Anne, "I can readily believe all that of my cousin.



<P>He seems to have a calm decided temper, not at all open



<P>to dangerous impressions.&nbsp; I consider him with great respect.



<P>I have no reason, from any thing that has fallen within my observation,



<P>to do otherwise.&nbsp; But I have not known him long; and he is not

a man,



<P>I think, to be known intimately soon.&nbsp; Will not this manner



<P>of speaking of him, Mrs Smith, convince you that he is nothing to me?



<P>Surely this must be calm enough.&nbsp; And, upon my word, he is nothing

to me.



<P>Should he ever propose to me (which I have very little reason to imagine



<P>he has any thought of doing), I shall not accept him.&nbsp; I assure

you



<P>I shall not.&nbsp; I assure you, Mr Elliot had not the share which



<P>you have been supposing, in whatever pleasure the concert



<P>of last night might afford:&nbsp; not Mr Elliot; it is not Mr Elliot

that--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She stopped, regretting with a deep blush that she had implied so much;



<P>but less would hardly have been sufficient.&nbsp; Mrs Smith would hardly



<P>have believed so soon in Mr Elliot's failure, but from the perception



<P>of there being a somebody else.&nbsp; As it was, she instantly submitted,



<P>and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond; and Anne,



<P>eager to escape farther notice, was impatient to know why Mrs Smith



<P>should have fancied she was to marry Mr Elliot; where she could have



<P>received the idea, or from whom she could have heard it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do tell me how it first came into your head."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It first came into my head," replied Mrs Smith, "upon finding how much



<P>you were together, and feeling it to be the most probable thing



<P>in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you;



<P>and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed

of you



<P>in the same way.&nbsp; But I never heard it spoken of till two days

ago."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And has it indeed been spoken of?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when



<P>you called yesterday?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No.&nbsp; Was not it Mrs Speed, as usual, or the maid?&nbsp; I observed



<P>no one in particular."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It was my friend Mrs Rooke; Nurse Rooke; who, by-the-bye,



<P>had a great curiosity to see you, and was delighted to be in the way



<P>to let you in.&nbsp; She came away from Marlborough Buildings only on

Sunday;



<P>and she it was who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot.



<P>She had had it from Mrs Wallis herself, which did not seem bad authority.



<P>She sat an hour with me on Monday evening, and gave me the whole history."



<P>"The whole history," repeated Anne, laughing.&nbsp; "She could not make



<P>a very long history, I think, of one such little article



<P>of unfounded news."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs Smith said nothing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But," continued Anne, presently, "though there is no truth in my having



<P>this claim on Mr Elliot, I should be extremely happy to be of use to

you



<P>in any way that I could.&nbsp; Shall I mention to him your being in

Bath?



<P>Shall I take any message?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I thank you:&nbsp; no, certainly not.&nbsp; In the warmth of the

moment,



<P>and under a mistaken impression, I might, perhaps, have endeavoured



<P>to interest you in some circumstances; but not now.&nbsp; No, I thank

you,



<P>I have nothing to trouble you with."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I did."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not before he was married, I suppose?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes; he was not married when I knew him first."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And--were you much acquainted?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Intimately."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed!&nbsp; Then do tell me what he was at that time of life.



<P>I have a great curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young

man.



<P>Was he at all such as he appears now?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years," was Mrs Smith's answer,



<P>given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther;



<P>and Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity.



<P>They were both silent:&nbsp; Mrs Smith very thoughtful.&nbsp; At last--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I beg your pardon, my dear Miss Elliot," she cried, in her



<P>natural tone of cordiality, "I beg your pardon for the short answers



<P>I have been giving you, but I have been uncertain what I ought to do.



<P>I have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you.



<P>There were many things to be taken into the account.&nbsp; One hates



<P>to be officious, to be giving bad impressions, making mischief.



<P>Even the smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving,



<P>though there may be nothing durable beneath.&nbsp; However, I have determined;



<P>I think I am right; I think you ought to be made acquainted



<P>with Mr Elliot's real character.&nbsp; Though I fully believe that,



<P>at present, you have not the smallest intention of accepting him,



<P>there is no saying what may happen.&nbsp; You might, some time or other,



<P>be differently affected towards him.&nbsp; Hear the truth, therefore,



<P>now, while you are unprejudiced.&nbsp; Mr Elliot is a man without heart



<P>or conscience; a designing, wary, cold-blooded being, who thinks



<P>only of himself; whom for his own interest or ease, would be guilty



<P>of any cruelty, or any treachery, that could be perpetrated without



<P>risk of his general character.&nbsp; He has no feeling for others.



<P>Those whom he has been the chief cause of leading into ruin,



<P>he can neglect and desert without the smallest compunction.



<P>He is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion.



<P>Oh! he is black at heart, hollow and black!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne's astonished air, and exclamation of wonder, made her pause,



<P>and in a calmer manner, she added,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My expressions startle you.&nbsp; You must allow for an injured, angry

woman.



<P>But I will try to command myself.&nbsp; I will not abuse him.



<P>I will only tell you what I have found him.&nbsp; Facts shall speak.



<P>He was the intimate friend of my dear husband, who trusted and loved

him,



<P>and thought him as good as himself.&nbsp; The intimacy had been formed



<P>before our marriage.&nbsp; I found them most intimate friends; and I,

too,



<P>became excessively pleased with Mr Elliot, and entertained



<P>the highest opinion of him.&nbsp; At nineteen, you know, one does not



<P>think very seriously; but Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as

others,



<P>and much more agreeable than most others, and we were almost



<P>always together.&nbsp; We were principally in town, living in very good

style.



<P>He was then the inferior in circumstances; he was then the poor one;



<P>he had chambers in the Temple, and it was as much as he could do



<P>to support the appearance of a gentleman.&nbsp; He had always a home



<P>with us whenever he chose it; he was always welcome; he was like a brother.



<P>My poor Charles, who had the finest, most generous spirit in the world,



<P>would have divided his last farthing with him; and I know that his purse



<P>was open to him; I know that he often assisted him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot's life,"



<P>said Anne, "which has always excited my particular curiosity.



<P>It must have been about the same time that he became known to



<P>my father and sister.&nbsp; I never knew him myself; I only heard of

him;



<P>but there was a something in his conduct then, with regard to



<P>my father and sister, and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage,



<P>which I never could quite reconcile with present times.&nbsp; It seemed



<P>to announce a different sort of man."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I know it all, I know it all," cried Mrs Smith.&nbsp; "He had been



<P>introduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with

him,



<P>but I heard him speak of them for ever.&nbsp; I know he was invited



<P>and encouraged, and I know he did not choose to go.&nbsp; I can satisfy

you,



<P>perhaps, on points which you would little expect; and as to his marriage,



<P>I knew all about it at the time.&nbsp; I was privy to all the fors and

againsts;



<P>I was the friend to whom he confided his hopes and plans; and though



<P>I did not know his wife previously, her inferior situation in society,



<P>indeed, rendered that impossible, yet I knew her all her life afterwards,



<P>or at least till within the last two years of her life, and can answer



<P>any question you may wish to put."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nay," said Anne, "I have no particular enquiry to make about her.



<P>I have always understood they were not a happy couple.&nbsp; But I should



<P>like to know why, at that time of his life, he should slight



<P>my father's acquaintance as he did.&nbsp; My father was certainly disposed



<P>to take very kind and proper notice of him.&nbsp; Why did Mr Elliot

draw back?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr Elliot," replied Mrs Smith, "at that period of his life,



<P>had one object in view:&nbsp; to make his fortune, and by a rather quicker



<P>process than the law.&nbsp; He was determined to make it by marriage.



<P>He was determined, at least, not to mar it by an imprudent marriage;



<P>and I know it was his belief (whether justly or not, of course



<P>I cannot decide), that your father and sister, in their civilities



<P>and invitations, were designing a match between the heir



<P>and the young lady, and it was impossible that such a match



<P>should have answered his ideas of wealth and independence.



<P>That was his motive for drawing back, I can assure you.



<P>He told me the whole story.&nbsp; He had no concealments with me.



<P>It was curious, that having just left you behind me in Bath,



<P>my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be your cousin;



<P>and that, through him, I should be continually hearing of your father



<P>and sister.&nbsp; He described one Miss Elliot, and I thought



<P>very affectionately of the other."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Perhaps," cried Anne, struck by a sudden idea, "you sometimes



<P>spoke of me to Mr Elliot?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To be sure I did; very often.&nbsp; I used to boast of my own Anne

Elliot,



<P>and vouch for your being a very different creature from--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She checked herself just in time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night,"



<P>cried Anne.&nbsp; "This explains it.&nbsp; I found he had been used

to hear of me.



<P>I could not comprehend how.&nbsp; What wild imaginations one forms where



<P>dear self is concerned!&nbsp; How sure to be mistaken!&nbsp; But I beg

your pardon;



<P>I have interrupted you.&nbsp; Mr Elliot married then completely for

money?



<P>The circumstances, probably, which first opened your eyes



<P>to his character."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs Smith hesitated a little here.&nbsp; "Oh! those things are too common.



<P>When one lives in the world, a man or woman's marrying for money



<P>is too common to strike one as it ought.&nbsp; I was very young,



<P>and associated only with the young, and we were a thoughtless,



<P>gay set, without any strict rules of conduct.&nbsp; We lived for enjoyment.



<P>I think differently now; time and sickness and sorrow have given me



<P>other notions; but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible



<P>in what Mr Elliot was doing.&nbsp; `To do the best for himself,'



<P>passed as a duty."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But was not she a very low woman?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes; which I objected to, but he would not regard.&nbsp; Money, money,



<P>was all that he wanted.&nbsp; Her father was a grazier, her grandfather



<P>had been a butcher, but that was all nothing.&nbsp; She was a fine woman,



<P>had had a decent education, was brought forward by some cousins,



<P>thrown by chance into Mr Elliot's company, and fell in love with him;



<P>and not a difficulty or a scruple was there on his side,



<P>with respect to her birth.&nbsp; All his caution was spent in being

secured



<P>of the real amount of her fortune, before he committed himself.



<P>Depend upon it, whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation



<P>in life now, as a young man he had not the smallest value for it.



<P>His chance for the Kellynch estate was something, but all the honour



<P>of the family he held as cheap as dirt.&nbsp; I have often heard him

declare,



<P>that if baronetcies were saleable, anybody should have his



<P>for fifty pounds, arms and motto, name and livery included;



<P>but I will not pretend to repeat half that I used to hear him say



<P>on that subject.&nbsp; It would not be fair; and yet you ought to have

proof,



<P>for what is all this but assertion, and you shall have proof."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed, my dear Mrs Smith, I want none," cried Anne.&nbsp; "You have

asserted



<P>nothing contradictory to what Mr Elliot appeared to be some years ago.



<P>This is all in confirmation, rather, of what we used to hear and believe.



<P>I am more curious to know why he should be so different now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But for my satisfaction, if you will have the goodness to ring for

Mary;



<P>stay:&nbsp; I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of



<P>going yourself into my bedroom, and bringing me the small inlaid box



<P>which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne, seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it, did as she was desired.



<P>The box was brought and placed before her, and Mrs Smith, sighing over

it



<P>as she unlocked it, said--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This is full of papers belonging to him, to my husband;



<P>a small portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him.



<P>The letter I am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him



<P>before our marriage, and happened to be saved; why, one can hardly imagine.



<P>But he was careless and immethodical, like other men, about those things;



<P>and when I came to examine his papers, I found it with others



<P>still more trivial, from different people scattered here and there,



<P>while many letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed.



<P>Here it is; I would not burn it, because being even then very little



<P>satisfied with Mr Elliot, I was determined to preserve every document



<P>of former intimacy.&nbsp; I have now another motive for being glad



<P>that I can produce it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was the letter, directed to "Charles Smith, Esq. Tunbridge Wells,"



<P>and dated from London, as far back as July, 1803: --

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dear Smith,--I have received yours.&nbsp; Your kindness almost overpowers

me.



<P>I wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common, but I have



<P>lived three-and-twenty years in the world, and have seen none like it.



<P>At present, believe me, I have no need of your services,



<P>being in cash again.&nbsp; Give me joy:&nbsp; I have got rid of Sir

Walter and Miss.



<P>They are gone back to Kellynch, and almost made me swear to visit them



<P>this summer; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor,



<P>to tell me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer.



<P>The baronet, nevertheless, is not unlikely to marry again;



<P>he is quite fool enough.&nbsp; If he does, however, they will leave

me in peace,



<P>which may be a decent equivalent&nbsp; for the reversion.&nbsp; He is

worse



<P>than last year.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wish I had any name but Elliot.&nbsp; I am sick of it.&nbsp; The

name of Walter



<P>I can drop, thank God! and I desire you will never insult me



<P>with my second W. again, meaning, for the rest of my life,



<P>to be only yours truly,--Wm. Elliot."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Such a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow;



<P>and Mrs Smith, observing the high colour in her face, said--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The language, I know, is highly disrespectful.&nbsp; Though I have

forgot



<P>the exact terms, I have a perfect impression of the general meaning.



<P>But it shows you the man.&nbsp; Mark his professions to my poor husband.



<P>Can any thing be stronger?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification



<P>of finding such words applied to her father.&nbsp; She was obliged to

recollect



<P>that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour,



<P>that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies,



<P>that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others,



<P>before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter



<P>which she had been meditating over, and say--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you.&nbsp; This is full proof undoubtedly; proof of every thing



<P>you were saying.&nbsp; But why be acquainted with us now?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I can explain this too," cried Mrs Smith, smiling.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Can you really?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes.&nbsp; I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago,



<P>and I will shew him as he is now.&nbsp; I cannot produce written proof

again,



<P>but I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire, of what



<P>he is now wanting, and what he is now doing.&nbsp; He is no hypocrite

now.



<P>He truly wants to marry you.&nbsp; His present attentions to your family



<P>are very sincere:&nbsp; quite from the heart.&nbsp; I will give you

my authority:



<P>his friend Colonel Wallis."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Colonel Wallis! you are acquainted with him?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No.&nbsp; It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that;



<P>it takes a bend or two, but nothing of consequence.&nbsp; The stream



<P>is as good as at first; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings



<P>is easily moved away.&nbsp; Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel

Wallis



<P>of his views on you, which said Colonel Wallis, I imagine to be,



<P>in himself, a sensible, careful, discerning sort of character;



<P>but Colonel Wallis has a very pretty silly wife, to whom



<P>he tells things which he had better not, and he repeats it all to her.



<P>She in the overflowing spirits of her recovery, repeats it all



<P>to her nurse; and the nurse&nbsp; knowing my acquaintance with you,



<P>very naturally brings it all to me.&nbsp; On Monday evening, my good

friend



<P>Mrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of Marlborough Buildings.



<P>When I talked of a whole history, therefore, you see I was



<P>not romancing so much as you supposed."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Mrs Smith, your authority is deficient.&nbsp; This will not

do.



<P>Mr Elliot's having any views on me will not in the least account



<P>for the efforts he made towards a reconciliation with my father.



<P>That was all prior to my coming to Bath.&nbsp; I found them on



<P>the most friendly terms when I arrived."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I know you did; I know it all perfectly, but--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed, Mrs Smith, we must not expect to get real information



<P>in such a line.&nbsp; Facts or opinions which are to pass through the

hands



<P>of so many, to be misconceived by folly in one, and ignorance in another,



<P>can hardly have much truth left."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Only give me a hearing.&nbsp; You will soon be able to judge of



<P>the general credit due, by listening to some particulars



<P>which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm.



<P>Nobody supposes that you were his first inducement.&nbsp; He had seen

you



<P>indeed, before he came to Bath, and admired you, but without



<P>knowing it to be you.&nbsp; So says my historian, at least.&nbsp; Is

this true?



<P>Did he see you last summer or autumn, `somewhere down in the west,'



<P>to use her own words, without knowing it to be you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He certainly did.&nbsp; So far it is very true.&nbsp; At Lyme.



<P>I happened to be at Lyme."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well," continued Mrs Smith, triumphantly, "grant my friend the credit



<P>due to the establishment of the first point asserted.&nbsp; He saw you

then



<P>at Lyme, and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased



<P>to meet with you again in Camden Place, as Miss Anne Elliot,



<P>and from that moment, I have no doubt, had a double motive



<P>in his visits there.&nbsp; But there was another, and an earlier,



<P>which I will now explain.&nbsp; If there is anything in my story which

you know



<P>to be either false or improbable, stop me.&nbsp; My account states,



<P>that your sister's friend, the lady now staying with you,



<P>whom I have heard you mention, came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir

Walter



<P>as long ago as September (in short when they first came themselves),



<P>and has been staying there ever since; that she is a clever, insinuating,



<P>handsome woman, poor and plausible, and altogether such in situation



<P>and manner, as to give a general idea, among Sir Walter's acquaintance,



<P>of her meaning to be Lady Elliot, and as general a surprise



<P>that Miss Elliot should be apparently, blind to the danger."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here Mrs Smith paused a moment; but Anne had not a word to say,



<P>and she continued--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family,



<P>long before you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had his eye



<P>upon your father enough to be sensible of it, though he did not then



<P>visit in Camden Place; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest



<P>in watching all that was going on there, and when Mr Elliot came to

Bath



<P>for a day or two, as he happened to do a little before Christmas,



<P>Colonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things,



<P>and the reports beginning to prevail.&nbsp; Now you are to understand,



<P>that time had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot's opinions



<P>as to the value of a baronetcy.&nbsp; Upon all points of blood and connexion



<P>he is a completely altered man.&nbsp; Having long had as much money



<P>as he could spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice



<P>or indulgence, he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness



<P>upon the consequence he is heir to.&nbsp; I thought it coming on



<P>before our acquaintance ceased, but it is now a confirmed feeling.



<P>He cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William.&nbsp; You may guess,



<P>therefore, that the news he heard from his friend could not be



<P>very agreeable, and you may guess what it produced; the resolution



<P>of coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and of fixing himself here



<P>for a time, with the view of renewing his former acquaintance,



<P>and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means



<P>of ascertaining the degree of his danger, and of circumventing the lady



<P>if he found it material.&nbsp; This was agreed upon between the two

friends



<P>as the only thing to be done; and Colonel Wallis was to assist



<P>in every way that he could.&nbsp; He was to be introduced, and Mrs Wallis



<P>was to be introduced, and everybody was to be introduced.



<P>Mr Elliot came back accordingly; and on application was forgiven,



<P>as you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it was



<P>his constant object, and his only object (till your arrival



<P>added another motive), to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay.



<P>He omitted no opportunity of being with them, threw himself in their

way,



<P>called at all hours; but I need not be particular on this subject.



<P>You can imagine what an artful man would do; and with this guide,



<P>perhaps, may recollect what you have seen him do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," said Anne, "you tell me nothing which does not accord with



<P>what I have known, or could imagine.&nbsp; There is always something

offensive



<P>in the details of cunning.&nbsp; The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity



<P>must ever be revolting, but I have heard nothing which really surprises

me.



<P>I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr Elliot,



<P>who would have difficulty in believing it; but I have never been satisfied.



<P>I have always wanted some other motive for his conduct than appeared.



<P>I should like to know his present opinion, as to the probability



<P>of the event he has been in dread of; whether he considers the danger



<P>to be lessening or not."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Lessening, I understand," replied Mrs Smith.&nbsp; "He thinks Mrs Clay



<P>afraid of him, aware that he sees through her, and not daring to proceed



<P>as she might do in his absence.&nbsp; But since he must be absent



<P>some time or other, I do not perceive how he can ever be secure



<P>while she holds her present influence.&nbsp; Mrs Wallis has an amusing

idea,



<P>as nurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles



<P>when you and Mr Elliot marry, that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay.



<P>A scheme, worthy of Mrs Wallis's understanding, by all accounts;



<P>but my sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it.&nbsp; `Why, to

be sure,



<P>ma'am,' said she, `it would not prevent his marrying anybody else.'



<P>And, indeed, to own the truth, I do not think nurse, in her heart,



<P>is a very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter's making a second match.



<P>She must be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony, you know;



<P>and (since self will intrude) who can say that she may not have



<P>some flying visions of attending the next Lady Elliot, through



<P>Mrs Wallis's recommendation?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am very glad to know all this," said Anne, after a little



<P>thoughtfulness.&nbsp; "It will be more painful to me in some respects



<P>to be in company with him, but I shall know better what to do.



<P>My line of conduct will be more direct.&nbsp; Mr Elliot is evidently



<P>a disingenuous, artificial, worldly man, who has never had



<P>any better principle to guide him than selfishness."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Mr Elliot was not done with.&nbsp; Mrs Smith had been carried away



<P>from her first direction, and Anne had forgotten, in the interest



<P>of her own family concerns, how much had been originally implied



<P>against him; but her attention was now called to the explanation



<P>of those first hints, and she listened to a recital which,



<P>if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith,



<P>proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her;



<P>very deficient both in justice and compassion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She learned that (the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired



<P>by Mr Elliot's marriage) they had been as before always together,



<P>and Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune.



<P>Mrs Smith did not want to take blame to herself, and was most tender



<P>of throwing any on her husband; but Anne could collect that their income



<P>had never been equal to their style of living, and that from the first



<P>there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance.



<P>From his wife's account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been



<P>a man of warm feelings, easy temper, careless habits, and not strong



<P>understanding, much more amiable than his friend, and very unlike him,



<P>led by him, and probably despised by him.&nbsp; Mr Elliot, raised by



<P>his marriage to great affluence, and disposed to every gratification



<P>of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself,



<P>(for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man),



<P>and beginning to be rich, just as his friend ought to have found himself



<P>to be poor, seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend's



<P>probable finances, but, on the contrary, had been prompting and



<P>encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin; and the Smiths



<P>accordingly had been ruined.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of

it.



<P>They had previously known embarrassments enough to try the friendship



<P>of their friends, and to prove that Mr Elliot's had better not be tried;



<P>but it was not till his death that the wretched state of his affairs



<P>was fully known.&nbsp; With a confidence in Mr Elliot's regard,



<P>more creditable to his feelings than his judgement, Mr Smith had



<P>appointed him the executor of his will; but Mr Elliot would not act,



<P>and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her,



<P>in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation, had been

such



<P>as could not be related without anguish of spirit, or listened to



<P>without corresponding indignation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion, answers to



<P>urgent applications from Mrs Smith, which all breathed the same



<P>stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble, and,



<P>under a cold civility, the same hard-hearted indifference



<P>to any of the evils it might bring on her.&nbsp; It was a dreadful picture



<P>of ingratitude and inhumanity; and Anne felt, at some moments,



<P>that no flagrant open crime could have been worse.&nbsp; She had a great

deal



<P>to listen to; all the particulars of past sad scenes, all the minutiae



<P>of distress upon distress, which in former conversations had been



<P>merely hinted at, were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence.



<P>Anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief, and was only



<P>the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend's



<P>usual state of mind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was one circumstance in the history of her grievances



<P>of particular irritation.&nbsp; She had good reason to believe



<P>that some property of her husband in the West Indies, which had been



<P>for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of



<P>its own incumbrances, might be recoverable by proper measures;



<P>and this property, though not large, would be enough to make her



<P>comparatively rich.&nbsp; But there was nobody to stir in it.



<P>Mr Elliot would do nothing, and she could do nothing herself,



<P>equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness,



<P>and from employing others by her want of money.&nbsp; She had no



<P>natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel,



<P>and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law.



<P>This was a cruel aggravation of actually streightened means.



<P>To feel that she ought to be in better circumstances, that a little

trouble



<P>in the right place might do it, and to fear that delay might be



<P>even weakening her claims, was hard to bear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne's good offices



<P>with Mr Elliot.&nbsp; She had previously, in the anticipation



<P>of their marriage, been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it;



<P>but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature,



<P>since he did not even know her to be in Bath, it immediately occurred,



<P>that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman



<P>he loved, and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne's feelings,



<P>as far as the observances due to Mr Elliot's character would allow,



<P>when Anne's refutation of the supposed engagement changed



<P>the face of everything; and while it took from her the new-formed hope



<P>of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety, left her at least



<P>the comfort of telling the whole story her own way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After listening to this full description of Mr Elliot, Anne could not

but



<P>express some surprise at Mrs Smith's having spoken of him so favourably



<P>in the beginning of their conversation.&nbsp; "She had seemed to recommend



<P>and praise him!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear," was Mrs Smith's reply, "there was nothing else to be done.



<P>I considered your marrying him as certain, though he might not yet



<P>have made the offer, and I could no more speak the truth of him,



<P>than if he had been your husband.&nbsp; My heart bled for you,



<P>as I talked of happiness; and yet he is sensible, he is agreeable,



<P>and with such a woman as you, it was not absolutely hopeless.



<P>He was very unkind to his first wife.&nbsp; They were wretched together.



<P>But she was too ignorant and giddy for respect, and he had never loved

her.



<P>I was willing to hope that you must fare better."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility



<P>of having been induced to marry him, as made her shudder at the idea



<P>of the misery which must have followed.&nbsp; It was just possible that



<P>she might have been persuaded by Lady Russell!&nbsp; And under such



<P>a supposition, which would have been most miserable, when time had



<P>disclosed all, too late?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived;



<P>and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference,



<P>which carried them through the greater part of the morning,



<P>was, that Anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend



<P>everything relative to Mrs Smith, in which his conduct was involved.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>While Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne, and expressing



<P>his wish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath, Captain Wentworth



<P>was already on his way thither.&nbsp; Before Mrs Croft had written,



<P>he was arrived, and the very next time Anne walked out, she saw him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr Elliot was attending his two cousins and Mrs Clay.&nbsp; They were



<P>in Milsom Street.&nbsp; It began to rain, not much, but enough to



<P>make shelter desirable for women, and quite enough to make it



<P>very desirable for Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being



<P>conveyed home in Lady Dalrymple's carriage, which was seen waiting



<P>at a little distance; she, Anne, and Mrs Clay, therefore,



<P>turned into Molland's, while Mr Elliot stepped to Lady Dalrymple,



<P>to request her assistance.&nbsp; He soon joined them again, successful,



<P>of course; Lady Dalrymple would be most happy to take them home,



<P>and would call for them in a few minutes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her ladyship's carriage was a barouche, and did not hold



<P>more than four with any comfort.&nbsp; Miss Carteret was with her mother;



<P>consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation



<P>for all the three Camden Place ladies.&nbsp; There could be no doubt



<P>as to Miss Elliot.&nbsp; Whoever suffered inconvenience, she must suffer

none,



<P>but it occupied a little time to settle the point of civility



<P>between the other two.&nbsp; The rain was a mere trifle, and Anne was



<P>most sincere in preferring a walk with Mr Elliot.&nbsp; But the rain

was also



<P>a mere trifle to Mrs Clay; she would hardly allow it even to drop at

all,



<P>and her boots were so thick! much thicker than Miss Anne's;



<P>and, in short, her civility rendered her quite as anxious to be left



<P>to walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be, and it was discussed between

them



<P>with a generosity so polite and so determined, that the others were



<P>obliged to settle it for them; Miss Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay



<P>had a little cold already, and Mr Elliot deciding on appeal,



<P>that his cousin Anne's boots were rather the thickest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was fixed accordingly, that Mrs Clay should be of the party



<P>in the carriage; and they had just reached this point, when Anne,



<P>as she sat near the window, descried, most decidedly and distinctly,



<P>Captain Wentworth walking down the street.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her start was perceptible only to herself; but she instantly felt that



<P>she was the greatest simpleton in the world, the most unaccountable



<P>and absurd!&nbsp; For a few minutes she saw nothing before her;



<P>it was all confusion.&nbsp; She was lost, and when she had scolded



<P>back her senses, she found the others still waiting for the carriage,



<P>and Mr Elliot (always obliging) just setting off for Union Street



<P>on a commission of Mrs Clay's.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door;



<P>she wanted to see if it rained.&nbsp; Why was she to suspect herself



<P>of another motive?&nbsp; Captain Wentworth must be out of sight.



<P>She left her seat, she would go; one half of her should not be always



<P>so much wiser than the other half, or always suspecting the other



<P>of being worse than it was.&nbsp; She would see if it rained.



<P>She was sent back, however, in a moment by the entrance of



<P>Captain Wentworth himself, among a party of gentlemen and ladies,



<P>evidently his acquaintance, and whom he must have joined



<P>a little below Milsom Street.&nbsp; He was more obviously struck



<P>and confused by the sight of her than she had ever observed before;



<P>he looked quite red.&nbsp; For the first time, since their renewed acquaintance,



<P>she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two.



<P>She had the advantage of him in the preparation of the last few moments.



<P>All the overpowering, blinding, bewildering, first effects



<P>of strong surprise were over with her.&nbsp; Still, however,



<P>she had enough to feel!&nbsp; It was agitation, pain, pleasure,



<P>a something between delight and misery.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He spoke to her, and then turned away.&nbsp; The character of his manner



<P>was embarrassment.&nbsp; She could not have called it either cold or

friendly,



<P>or anything so certainly as embarrassed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a short interval, however, he came towards her, and spoke again.



<P>Mutual enquiries on common subjects passed:&nbsp; neither of them, probably,



<P>much the wiser for what they heard, and Anne continuing fully sensible



<P>of his being less at ease than formerly.&nbsp; They had by dint of being



<P>so very much together, got to speak to each other with a considerable



<P>portion of apparent indifference and calmness; but he could not do it

now.



<P>Time had changed him, or Louisa had changed him.&nbsp; There was consciousness



<P>of some sort or other.&nbsp; He looked very well, not as if he had been



<P>suffering in health or spirits, and he talked of Uppercross,



<P>of the Musgroves, nay, even of Louisa, and had even a momentary look



<P>of his own arch significance as he named her; but yet it was



<P>Captain Wentworth not comfortable, not easy, not able to feign that

he was.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It did not surprise, but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth



<P>would not know him.&nbsp; She saw that he saw Elizabeth, that Elizabeth

saw him,



<P>that there was complete internal recognition on each side;



<P>she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance,



<P>expecting it, and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away



<P>with unalterable coldness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Lady Dalrymple's carriage, for which Miss Elliot was growing



<P>very impatient, now drew up; the servant came in to announce it.



<P>It was beginning to rain again, and altogether there was a delay,



<P>and a bustle, and a talking, which must make all the little crowd



<P>in the shop understand that Lady Dalrymple was calling to convey



<P>Miss Elliot.&nbsp; At last Miss Elliot and her friend, unattended but



<P>by the servant, (for there was no cousin returned), were walking off;



<P>and Captain Wentworth, watching them, turned again to Anne,



<P>and by manner, rather than words, was offering his services to her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am much obliged to you," was her answer, "but I am not going with

them.



<P>The carriage would not accommodate so many.&nbsp; I walk:&nbsp; I prefer

walking."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But it rains."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! very little,&nbsp; Nothing that I regard."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a moment's pause he said:&nbsp; "Though I came only yesterday,



<P>I have equipped myself properly for Bath already, you see,"



<P>(pointing to a new umbrella); "I wish you would make use of it,



<P>if you are determined to walk; though I think it would be more prudent



<P>to let me get you a chair."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was very much obliged to him, but declined it all, repeating



<P>her conviction, that the rain would come to nothing at present,



<P>and adding, "I am only waiting for Mr Elliot.&nbsp; He will be here

in a moment,



<P>I am sure."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliot walked in.



<P>Captain Wentworth recollected him perfectly.&nbsp; There was no difference



<P>between him and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme,



<P>admiring Anne as she passed, except in the air and look and manner



<P>of the privileged relation and friend.&nbsp; He came in with eagerness,



<P>appeared to see and think only of her, apologised for his stay,



<P>was grieved to have kept her waiting, and anxious to get her away



<P>without further loss of time and before the rain increased;



<P>and in another moment they walked off together, her arm under his,



<P>a gentle and embarrassed glance, and a "Good morning to you!"



<P>being all that she had time for, as she passed away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As soon as they were out of sight, the ladies of Captain Wentworth's

party



<P>began talking of them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr Elliot does not dislike his cousin, I fancy?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! no, that is clear enough.&nbsp; One can guess what will happen

there.



<P>He is always with them; half lives in the family, I believe.



<P>What a very good-looking man!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, and Miss Atkinson, who dined with him once at the Wallises,



<P>says he is the most agreeable man she ever was in company with."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She is pretty, I think; Anne Elliot; very pretty, when one comes



<P>to look at her.&nbsp; It is not the fashion to say so, but I confess



<P>I admire her more than her sister."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! so do I."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And so do I.&nbsp; No comparison.&nbsp; But the men are all wild after

Miss Elliot.



<P>Anne is too delicate for them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne would have been particularly obliged to her cousin, if he would

have



<P>walked by her side all the way to Camden Place, without saying a word.



<P>She had never found it so difficult to listen to him, though nothing



<P>could exceed his solicitude and care, and though his subjects



<P>were principally such as were wont to be always interesting:



<P>praise, warm, just, and discriminating, of Lady Russell,



<P>and insinuations highly rational against Mrs Clay.&nbsp; But just now



<P>she could think only of Captain Wentworth.&nbsp; She could not understand



<P>his present feelings, whether he were really suffering much



<P>from disappointment or not; and till that point were settled,



<P>she could not be quite herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas! alas!



<P>she must confess to herself that she was not wise yet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Another circumstance very essential for her to know, was how long



<P>he meant to be in Bath; he had not mentioned it, or she could not



<P>recollect it.&nbsp; He might be only passing through.&nbsp; But it was

more probable



<P>that he should be come to stay.&nbsp; In that case, so liable as every

body was



<P>to meet every body in Bath, Lady Russell would in all likelihood



<P>see him somewhere.&nbsp; Would she recollect him?&nbsp; How would it

all be?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove



<P>was to marry Captain Benwick.&nbsp; It had cost her something to encounter



<P>Lady Russell's surprise; and now, if she were by any chance



<P>to be thrown into company with Captain Wentworth, her imperfect knowledge



<P>of the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The following morning Anne was out with her friend, and for the first

hour,



<P>in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him in vain; but at last,



<P>in returning down Pulteney Street, she distinguished him



<P>on the right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him in view



<P>the greater part of the street.&nbsp; There were many other men about

him,



<P>many groups walking the same way, but there was no mistaking him.



<P>She looked instinctively at Lady Russell; but not from any mad idea



<P>of her recognising him so soon as she did herself.&nbsp; No, it was



<P>not to be supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they



<P>were nearly opposite.&nbsp; She looked at her however, from time to

time,



<P>anxiously; and when the moment approached which must point him out,



<P>though not daring to look again (for her own countenance she knew



<P>was unfit to be seen), she was yet perfectly conscious of



<P>Lady Russell's eyes being turned exactly in the direction for him--



<P>of her being, in short, intently observing him.&nbsp; She could thoroughly



<P>comprehend the sort of fascination he must possess over Lady Russell's

mind,



<P>the difficulty it must be for her to withdraw her eyes, the astonishment



<P>she must be feeling that eight or nine years should have passed over

him,



<P>and in foreign climes and in active service too, without robbing him



<P>of one personal grace!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At last, Lady Russell drew back her head.&nbsp; "Now, how would she



<P>speak of him?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You will wonder," said she, "what has been fixing my eye so long;



<P>but I was looking after some window-curtains, which Lady Alicia and



<P>Mrs Frankland were telling me of last night.&nbsp; They described



<P>the drawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this



<P>side of the way, and this part of the street, as being the handsomest



<P>and best hung of any in Bath, but could not recollect the exact number,



<P>and I have been trying to find out which it could be; but I confess



<P>I can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne sighed and blushed and smiled, in pity and disdain,



<P>either at her friend or herself.&nbsp; The part which provoked her most,



<P>was that in all this waste of foresight and caution, she should have



<P>lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A day or two passed without producing anything.&nbsp; The theatre or

the rooms,



<P>where he was most likely to be, were not fashionable enough



<P>for the Elliots, whose evening amusements were solely in the



<P>elegant stupidity of private parties, in which they were getting



<P>more and more engaged; and Anne, wearied of such a state of stagnation,



<P>sick of knowing nothing, and fancying herself stronger because



<P>her strength was not tried, was quite impatient for the concert evening.



<P>It was a concert for the benefit of a person patronised by Lady Dalrymple.



<P>Of course they must attend.&nbsp; It was really expected to be a good

one,



<P>and Captain Wentworth was very fond of music.&nbsp; If she could only

have



<P>a few minutes conversation with him again, she fancied she should



<P>be satisfied; and as to the power of addressing him, she felt all over



<P>courage if the opportunity occurred.&nbsp; Elizabeth had turned from

him,



<P>Lady Russell overlooked him; her nerves were strengthened



<P>by these circumstances; she felt that she owed him attention.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her;



<P>but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off,



<P>with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow.



<P>Mrs Smith gave a most good-humoured acquiescence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"By all means," said she; "only tell me all about it, when you do come.



<P>Who is your party?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne named them all.&nbsp; Mrs Smith made no reply; but when she was



<P>leaving her said, and with an expression half serious, half arch,



<P>"Well, I heartily wish your concert may answer; and do not fail me



<P>to-morrow if you can come; for I begin to have a foreboding



<P>that I may not have many more visits from you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne was startled and confused; but after standing in a moment's suspense,



<P>was obliged, and not sorry to be obliged, to hurry away.

<P>Who can be in doubt of what followed?&nbsp; When any two young people



<P>take it into their heads to marry, they are pretty sure by perseverance



<P>to carry their point, be they ever so poor, or ever so imprudent,



<P>or ever so little likely to be necessary to each other's ultimate comfort.

<BR>This may be bad morality to conclude with, but I believe it to be truth;



<P>and if such parties succeed, how should a Captain Wentworth and



<P>an Anne Elliot, with the advantage of maturity of mind,



<P>consciousness of right, and one independent fortune between them,



<P>fail of bearing down every opposition?&nbsp; They might in fact,



<P>have borne down a great deal more than they met with, for there was



<P>little to distress them beyond the want of graciousness and warmth.

<BR>Sir Walter made no objection, and Elizabeth did nothing worse



<P>than look cold and unconcerned.&nbsp; Captain Wentworth, with five-and-twenty



<P>thousand pounds, and as high in his profession as merit and activity



<P>could place him, was no longer nobody.&nbsp; He was now esteemed quite

worthy



<P>to address the daughter of a foolish, spendthrift baronet,



<P>who had not had principle or sense enough to maintain himself



<P>in the situation in which Providence had placed him, and who could



<P>give his daughter at present but a small part of the share



<P>of ten thousand pounds which must be hers hereafter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sir Walter, indeed, though he had no affection for Anne,



<P>and no vanity flattered, to make him really happy on the occasion,



<P>was very far from thinking it a bad match for her.&nbsp; On the contrary,



<P>when he saw more of Captain Wentworth, saw him repeatedly by daylight,



<P>and eyed him well, he was very much struck by his personal claims,



<P>and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced



<P>against her superiority of rank; and all this, assisted by



<P>his well-sounding name, enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen,



<P>with a very good grace, for the insertion of the marriage



<P>in the volume of honour.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The only one among them, whose opposition of feeling could excite



<P>any serious anxiety was Lady Russell.&nbsp; Anne knew that Lady Russell



<P>must be suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr Elliot,



<P>and be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with,



<P>and do justice to Captain Wentworth.&nbsp; This however was what



<P>Lady Russell had now to do.&nbsp; She must learn to feel that she had



<P>been mistaken with regard to both; that she had been unfairly influenced



<P>by appearances in each; that because Captain Wentworth's manners



<P>had not suited her own ideas, she had been too quick in suspecting them



<P>to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity; and that because



<P>Mr Elliot's manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety



<P>and correctness, their general politeness and suavity, she had been



<P>too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct



<P>opinions and well-regulated mind.&nbsp; There was nothing less



<P>for Lady Russell to do, than to admit that she had been



<P>pretty completely wrong, and to take up a new set of opinions



<P>and of hopes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There is a quickness of perception in some, a nicety in the discernment



<P>of character, a natural penetration, in short, which no experience



<P>in others can equal, and Lady Russell had been less gifted



<P>in this part of understanding than her young friend.&nbsp; But she was



<P>a very good woman, and if her second object was to be sensible



<P>and well-judging, her first was to see Anne happy.&nbsp; She loved Anne



<P>better than she loved her own abilities; and when the awkwardness



<P>of the beginning was over, found little hardship in attaching herself



<P>as a mother to the man who was securing the happiness of her other child.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Of all the family, Mary was probably the one most immediately gratified



<P>by the circumstance.&nbsp; It was creditable to have a sister married,



<P>and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental



<P>to the connexion, by keeping Anne with her in the autumn;



<P>and as her own sister must be better than her husband's sisters,



<P>it was very agreeable that Captain Wentworth should be a richer man

than



<P>either Captain Benwick or Charles Hayter.&nbsp; She had something to

suffer,



<P>perhaps, when they came into contact again, in seeing Anne restored



<P>to the rights of seniority, and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette;



<P>but she had a future to look forward to, of powerful consolation.

<BR>Anne had no Uppercross Hall before her, no landed estate,



<P>no headship of a family; and if they could but keep Captain Wentworth



<P>from being made a baronet, she would not change situations with Anne.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It would be well for the eldest sister if she were equally satisfied



<P>with her situation, for a change is not very probable there.

<BR>She had soon the mortification of seeing Mr Elliot withdraw,



<P>and no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise



<P>even the unfounded hopes which sunk with him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The news of his cousins Anne's engagement burst on Mr Elliot



<P>most unexpectedly.&nbsp; It deranged his best plan of domestic happiness,



<P>his best hope of keeping Sir Walter single by the watchfulness



<P>which a son-in-law's rights would have given.&nbsp; But, though discomfited



<P>and disappointed, he could still do something for his own interest



<P>and his own enjoyment.&nbsp; He soon quitted Bath; and on Mrs Clay's



<P>quitting it soon afterwards, and being next heard of as established



<P>under his protection in London, it was evident how double a game



<P>he had been playing, and how determined he was to save himself



<P>from being cut out by one artful woman, at least.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs Clay's affections had overpowered her interest, and she had sacrificed,



<P>for the young man's sake, the possibility of scheming longer



<P>for Sir Walter.&nbsp; She has abilities, however, as well as affections;



<P>and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning, or hers,



<P>may finally carry the day; whether, after preventing her from being



<P>the wife of Sir Walter, he may not be wheedled and caressed at last



<P>into making her the wife of Sir William.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It cannot be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked



<P>and mortified by the loss of their companion, and the discovery of



<P>their deception in her.&nbsp; They had their great cousins, to be sure,



<P>to resort to for comfort; but they must long feel that to flatter



<P>and follow others, without being flattered and followed in turn,



<P>is but a state of half enjoyment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne, satisfied at a very early period of Lady Russell's meaning



<P>to love Captain Wentworth as she ought, had no other alloy



<P>to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness



<P>of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value.

<BR>There she felt her own inferiority very keenly.&nbsp; The disproportion



<P>in their fortune was nothing; it did not give her a moment's regret;



<P>but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly,



<P>nothing of respectability, of harmony, of good will to offer



<P>in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her



<P>in his brothers and sisters, was a source of as lively pain



<P>as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise



<P>strong felicity.&nbsp; She had but two friends in the world to add to

his list,



<P>Lady Russell and Mrs Smith.&nbsp; To those, however, he was very well

disposed



<P>to attach himself.&nbsp; Lady Russell, in spite of all her former transgressions,



<P>he could now value from his heart.&nbsp; While he was not obliged to

say



<P>that he believed her to have been right in originally dividing them,



<P>he was ready to say almost everything else in her favour,



<P>and as for Mrs Smith, she had claims of various kinds to recommend her



<P>quickly and permanently.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves,



<P>and their marriage, instead of depriving her of one friend,



<P>secured her two.&nbsp; She was their earliest visitor in their settled

life;



<P>and Captain Wentworth, by putting her in the way of recovering



<P>her husband's property in the West Indies, by writing for her,



<P>acting for her, and seeing her through all the petty difficulties



<P>of the case with the activity and exertion of a fearless man



<P>and a determined friend, fully requited the services which



<P>she had rendered, or ever meant to render, to his wife.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs Smith's enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income,



<P>with some improvement of health, and the acquisition of such friends



<P>to be often with, for her cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not



<P>fail her; and while these prime supplies of good remained, she might

have



<P>bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity.

<BR>She might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy,



<P>and yet be happy.&nbsp; Her spring of felicity was in the glow



<P>of her spirits, as her friend Anne's was in the warmth of her heart.

<BR>Anne was tenderness itself, and she had the full worth of it



<P>in Captain Wentworth's affection.&nbsp; His profession was all that

could ever



<P>make her friends wish that tenderness less, the dread of a future war



<P>all that could dim her sunshine.&nbsp; She gloried in being a sailor's

wife,



<P>but she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession



<P>which is, if possible, more distinguished in its domestic virtues



<P>than in its national importance.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>It was the beginning of February; and Anne, having been a month in Bath,



<P>was growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme.



<P>She wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated.



<P>It was three weeks since she had heard at all.&nbsp; She only knew



<P>that Henrietta was at home again; and that Louisa, though considered

to be



<P>recovering fast, was still in Lyme; and she was thinking of them all



<P>very intently one evening, when a thicker letter than usual from Mary



<P>was delivered to her; and, to quicken the pleasure and surprise,



<P>with Admiral and Mrs Croft's compliments.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Crofts must be in Bath!&nbsp; A circumstance to interest her.



<P>They were people whom her heart turned to very naturally.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What is this?" cried Sir Walter.&nbsp; "The Crofts have arrived in

Bath?



<P>The Crofts who rent Kellynch?&nbsp; What have they brought you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A letter from Uppercross Cottage, Sir."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! those letters are convenient passports.&nbsp; They secure an introduction.



<P>I should have visited Admiral Croft, however, at any rate.



<P>I know what is due to my tenant."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne could listen no longer; she could not even have told how



<P>the poor Admiral's complexion escaped; her letter engrossed her.



<P>It had been begun several days back.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "February 1st.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Anne,--I make no apology for my silence, because I know



<P>how little people think of letters in such a place as Bath.



<P>You must be a great deal too happy to care for Uppercross, which,



<P>as you well know, affords little to write about.&nbsp; We have had



<P>a very dull Christmas; Mr and Mrs Musgrove have not had one dinner party



<P>all the holidays.&nbsp; I do not reckon the Hayters as anybody.



<P>The holidays, however, are over at last:&nbsp; I believe no children

ever had



<P>such long ones.&nbsp; I am sure I had not.&nbsp; The house was cleared

yesterday,



<P>except of the little Harvilles; but you will be surprised to hear



<P>they have never gone home.&nbsp; Mrs Harville must be an odd mother



<P>to part with them so long.&nbsp; I do not understand it.&nbsp; They

are



<P>not at all nice children, in my opinion; but Mrs Musgrove seems to



<P>like them quite as well, if not better, than her grandchildren.



<P>What dreadful weather we have had!&nbsp; It may not be felt in Bath,



<P>with your nice pavements; but in the country it is of some consequence.



<P>I have not had a creature call on me since the second week in January,



<P>except Charles Hayter, who had been calling much oftener than was welcome.



<P>Between ourselves, I think it a great pity Henrietta did not remain

at Lyme



<P>as long as Louisa; it would have kept her a little out of his way.



<P>The carriage is gone to-day, to bring Louisa and the Harvilles to-morrow.



<P>We are not asked to dine with them, however, till the day after,



<P>Mrs Musgrove is so afraid of her being fatigued by the journey,



<P>which is not very likely, considering the care that will be taken of

her;



<P>and it would be much more convenient to me to dine there to-morrow.



<P>I am glad you find Mr Elliot so agreeable, and wish I could be acquainted



<P>with him too; but I have my usual luck:&nbsp; I am always out of the

way



<P>when any thing desirable is going on; always the last of my family



<P>to be noticed.&nbsp; What an immense time Mrs Clay has been staying



<P>with Elizabeth!&nbsp; Does she never mean to go away?&nbsp; But perhaps



<P>if she were to leave the room vacant, we might not be invited.



<P>Let me know what you think of this.&nbsp; I do not expect my children



<P>to be asked, you know.&nbsp; I can leave them at the Great House very

well,



<P>for a month or six weeks.&nbsp; I have this moment heard that the Crofts



<P>are going to Bath almost immediately; they think the Admiral gouty.



<P>Charles heard it quite by chance; they have not had the civility



<P>to give me any notice, or of offering to take anything.



<P>I do not think they improve at all as neighbours.&nbsp; We see nothing

of them,



<P>and this is really an instance of gross inattention.&nbsp; Charles joins

me



<P>in love, and everything proper.&nbsp; Yours affectionately,



<P>&nbsp;"Mary M---.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am sorry to say that I am very far from well; and Jemima has



<P>just told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throat



<P>very much about.&nbsp; I dare say I shall catch it; and my sore-throats,



<P>you know, are always worse than anybody's."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So ended the first part, which had been afterwards put into an envelope,



<P>containing nearly as much more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I kept my letter open, that I might send you word how Louisa



<P>bore her journey, and now I am extremely glad I did, having a great

deal



<P>to add.&nbsp; In the first place, I had a note from Mrs Croft yesterday,



<P>offering to convey anything to you; a very kind, friendly note indeed,



<P>addressed to me, just as it ought; I shall therefore be able to



<P>make my letter as long as I like.&nbsp; The Admiral does not seem very

ill,



<P>and I sincerely hope Bath will do him all the good he wants.



<P>I shall be truly glad to have them back again.&nbsp; Our neighbourhood



<P>cannot spare such a pleasant family.&nbsp; But now for Louisa.



<P>I have something to communicate that will astonish you not a little.



<P>She and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very safely, and in the evening



<P>we went to ask her how she did, when we were rather surprised



<P>not to find Captain Benwick of the party, for he had been invited



<P>as well as the Harvilles; and what do you think was the reason?



<P>Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa,



<P>and not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer



<P>from Mr Musgrove; for it was all settled between him and her



<P>before she came away, and he had written to her father by Captain Harville.



<P>True, upon my honour!&nbsp; Are not you astonished?&nbsp; I shall be

surprised



<P>at least if you ever received a hint of it, for I never did.



<P>Mrs Musgrove protests solemnly that she knew nothing of the matter.



<P>We are all very well pleased, however, for though it is not equal to

her



<P>marrying Captain Wentworth, it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter;



<P>and Mr Musgrove has written his consent, and Captain Benwick



<P>is expected to-day.&nbsp; Mrs Harville says her husband feels a good

deal



<P>on his poor sister's account; but, however, Louisa is a great favourite



<P>with both.&nbsp; Indeed, Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love

her



<P>the better for having nursed her.&nbsp; Charles wonders what Captain

Wentworth



<P>will say; but if you remember, I never thought him attached to Louisa;



<P>I never could see anything of it.&nbsp; And this is the end, you see,



<P>of Captain Benwick's being supposed to be an admirer of yours.



<P>How Charles could take such a thing into his head was always



<P>incomprehensible to me.&nbsp; I hope he will be more agreeable now.



<P>Certainly not a great match for Louisa Musgrove, but a million times

better



<P>than marrying among the Hayters."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mary need not have feared her sister's being in any degree prepared



<P>for the news.&nbsp; She had never in her life been more astonished.



<P>Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!&nbsp; It was almost too wonderful



<P>for belief, and it was with the greatest effort that she could remain



<P>in the room, preserve an air of calmness, and answer the common questions



<P>of the moment.&nbsp; Happily for her, they were not many.&nbsp; Sir

Walter



<P>wanted to know whether the Crofts travelled with four horses,



<P>and whether they were likely to be situated in such a part of Bath



<P>as it might suit Miss Elliot and himself to visit in; but had



<P>little curiosity beyond.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How is Mary?" said Elizabeth; and without waiting for an answer,



<P>"And pray what brings the Crofts to Bath?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They come on the Admiral's account.&nbsp; He is thought to be gouty."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Gout and decrepitude!" said Sir Walter.&nbsp; "Poor old gentleman."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Have they any acquaintance here?" asked Elizabeth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not know; but I can hardly suppose that, at Admiral Croft's



<P>time of life, and in his profession, he should not have many acquaintance



<P>in such a place as this."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I suspect," said Sir Walter coolly, "that Admiral Croft



<P>will be best known in Bath as the renter of Kellynch Hall.



<P>Elizabeth, may we venture to present him and his wife in Laura Place?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, no! I think not.&nbsp; Situated as we are with Lady Dalrymple,

cousins,



<P>we ought to be very careful not to embarrass her with acquaintance



<P>she might not approve.&nbsp; If we were not related, it would not signify;



<P>but as cousins, she would feel scrupulous as to any proposal of ours.



<P>We had better leave the Crofts to find their own level.



<P>There are several odd-looking men walking about here, who,



<P>I am told, are sailors.&nbsp; The Crofts will associate with them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was Sir Walter and Elizabeth's share of interest in the letter;



<P>when Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention,



<P>in an enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove, and her fine little boys,



<P>Anne was at liberty.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In her own room, she tried to comprehend it.&nbsp; Well might Charles

wonder



<P>how Captain Wentworth would feel!&nbsp; Perhaps he had quitted the field,



<P>had given Louisa up, had ceased to love, had found he did not love her.



<P>She could not endure the idea of treachery or levity, or anything



<P>akin to ill usage between him and his friend.&nbsp; She could not endure



<P>that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Captain Benwick and Louisa Musgrove!&nbsp; The high-spirited,



<P>joyous-talking Louisa Musgrove, and the dejected, thinking,



<P>feeling, reading, Captain Benwick, seemed each of them everything



<P>that would not suit the other.&nbsp; Their minds most dissimilar!



<P>Where could have been the attraction?&nbsp; The answer soon presented

itself.



<P>It had been in situation.&nbsp; They had been thrown together several

weeks;



<P>they had been living in the same small family party:&nbsp; since Henrietta's



<P>coming away, they must have been depending almost entirely on each other,



<P>and Louisa, just recovering from illness, had been in an interesting

state,



<P>and Captain Benwick was not inconsolable.&nbsp; That was a point which

Anne



<P>had not been able to avoid suspecting before; and instead of drawing



<P>the same conclusion as Mary, from the present course of events,



<P>they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some



<P>dawning of tenderness toward herself.&nbsp; She did not mean, however,



<P>to derive much more from it to gratify her vanity, than Mary



<P>might have allowed.&nbsp; She was persuaded that any tolerably pleasing



<P>young woman who had listened and seemed to feel for him would have



<P>received the same compliment.&nbsp; He had an affectionate heart.



<P>He must love somebody.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She saw no reason against their being happy.&nbsp; Louisa had fine



<P>naval fervour to begin with, and they would soon grow more alike.



<P>He would gain cheerfulness, and she would learn to be an enthusiast



<P>for Scott and Lord Byron; nay, that was probably learnt already;



<P>of course they had fallen in love over poetry.&nbsp; The idea of



<P>Louisa Musgrove turned into a person of literary taste,



<P>and sentimental reflection was amusing, but she had no doubt



<P>of its being so.&nbsp; The day at Lyme, the fall from the Cobb,



<P>might influence her health, her nerves, her courage, her character to



<P>the end of her life, as thoroughly as it appeared to have



<P>influenced her fate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The conclusion of the whole was, that if the woman who had been sensible



<P>of Captain Wentworth's merits could be allowed to prefer another man,



<P>there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder;



<P>and if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it, certainly nothing



<P>to be regretted.&nbsp; No, it was not regret which made Anne's heart



<P>beat in spite of herself, and brought the colour into her cheeks



<P>when she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free.



<P>She had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate.



<P>They were too much like joy, senseless joy!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She longed to see the Crofts; but when the meeting took place,



<P>it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them.



<P>The visit of ceremony was paid and returned; and Louisa Musgrove



<P>was mentioned, and Captain Benwick, too, without even half a smile.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street,



<P>perfectly to Sir Walter's satisfaction.&nbsp; He was not at all ashamed



<P>of the acquaintance, and did, in fact, think and talk a great deal more



<P>about the Admiral, than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Crofts knew quite as many people in Bath as they wished for,



<P>and considered their intercourse with the Elliots as a mere matter of

form,



<P>and not in the least likely to afford them any pleasure.



<P>They brought with them their country habit of being almost always together.



<P>He was ordered to walk to keep off the gout, and Mrs Croft



<P>seemed to go shares with him in everything, and to walk



<P>for her life to do him good.&nbsp; Anne saw them wherever she went.



<P>Lady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning,



<P>and she never failed to think of them, and never failed to see them.



<P>Knowing their feelings as she did, it was a most attractive picture



<P>of happiness to her.&nbsp; She always watched them as long as she could,



<P>delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of,



<P>as they walked along in happy independence, or equally delighted



<P>to see the Admiral's hearty shake of the hand when he encountered



<P>an old friend, and observe their eagerness of conversation



<P>when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy, Mrs Croft



<P>looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself;



<P>but it so happened that one morning, about a week or ten days



<P>after the Croft's arrival, it suited her best to leave her friend,



<P>or her friend's carriage, in the lower part of the town,



<P>and return alone to Camden Place, and in walking up Milsom Street



<P>she had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral.&nbsp; He was standing



<P>by himself at a printshop window, with his hands behind him,



<P>in earnest contemplation of some print, and she not only might have



<P>passed him unseen, but was obliged to touch as well as address him



<P>before she could catch his notice.&nbsp; When he did perceive and



<P>acknowledge her, however, it was done with all his usual frankness



<P>and good humour.&nbsp; "Ha! is it you?&nbsp; Thank you, thank you.



<P>This is treating me like a friend.&nbsp; Here I am, you see,



<P>staring at a picture.&nbsp; I can never get by this shop without stopping.



<P>But what a thing here is, by way of a boat!&nbsp; Do look at it.



<P>Did you ever see the like?&nbsp; What queer fellows your fine painters

must be,



<P>to think that anybody would venture their lives in such a shapeless



<P>old cockleshell as that?&nbsp; And yet here are two gentlemen



<P>stuck up in it mightily at their ease, and looking about them at the

rocks



<P>and mountains, as if they were not to be upset the next moment,



<P>which they certainly must be.&nbsp; I wonder where that boat was built!"



<P>(laughing heartily); "I would not venture over a horsepond in it.



<P>Well," (turning away), "now, where are you bound?&nbsp; Can I go anywhere



<P>for you, or with you?&nbsp; Can I be of any use?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"None, I thank you, unless you will give me the pleasure of your company



<P>the little way our road lies together.&nbsp; I am going home."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That I will, with all my heart, and farther, too.&nbsp; Yes, yes



<P>we will have a snug walk together, and I have something to tell you



<P>as we go along.&nbsp; There, take my arm; that's right; I do not



<P>feel comfortable if I have not a woman there.&nbsp; Lord! what a boat

it is!"



<P>taking a last look at the picture, as they began to be in motion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Did you say that you had something to tell me, sir?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, I have, presently.&nbsp; But here comes a friend, Captain Brigden;



<P>I shall only say, `How d'ye do?' as we pass, however.&nbsp; I shall

not stop.



<P>`How d'ye do?'&nbsp; Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife.



<P>She, poor soul, is tied by the leg.&nbsp; She has a blister on one of

her heels,



<P>as large as a three-shilling piece.&nbsp; If you look across the street,



<P>you will see Admiral Brand coming down and his brother.&nbsp; Shabby

fellows,



<P>both of them!&nbsp; I am glad they are not on this side of the way.



<P>Sophy cannot bear them.&nbsp; They played me a pitiful trick once:



<P>got away with some of my best men.&nbsp; I will tell you the whole story



<P>another time.&nbsp; There comes old Sir Archibald Drew and his grandson.



<P>Look, he sees us; he kisses his hand to you; he takes you for my wife.



<P>Ah! the peace has come too soon for that younker.&nbsp; Poor old Sir

Archibald!



<P>How do you like Bath, Miss Elliot?&nbsp; It suits us very well.



<P>We are always meeting with some old friend or other; the streets



<P>full of them every morning; sure to have plenty of chat;



<P>and then we get away from them all, and shut ourselves in our lodgings,



<P>and draw in our chairs, and are snug as if we were at Kellynch,



<P>ay, or as we used to be even at North Yarmouth and Deal.



<P>We do not like our lodgings here the worse, I can tell you,



<P>for putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth.



<P>The wind blows through one of the cupboards just in the same way."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When they were got a little farther, Anne ventured to press again



<P>for what he had to communicate.&nbsp; She hoped when clear of Milsom

Street



<P>to have her curiosity gratified; but she was still obliged to wait,



<P>for the Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had



<P>gained the greater space and quiet of Belmont; and as she was



<P>not really Mrs Croft, she must let him have his own way.



<P>As soon as they were fairly ascending Belmont, he began--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, now you shall hear something that will surprise you.



<P>But first of all, you must tell me the name of the young lady



<P>I am going to talk about.&nbsp; That young lady, you know, that we have



<P>all been so concerned for.&nbsp; The Miss Musgrove, that all this has

been



<P>happening to.&nbsp; Her Christian name:&nbsp; I always forget her Christian

name."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really



<P>did; but now she could safely suggest the name of "Louisa."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ay, ay, Miss Louisa Musgrove, that is the name.&nbsp; I wish young

ladies



<P>had not such a number of fine Christian names.&nbsp; I should never

be out



<P>if they were all Sophys, or something of that sort.&nbsp; Well,



<P>this Miss Louisa, we all thought, you know, was to marry Frederick.



<P>He was courting her week after week.&nbsp; The only wonder was,



<P>what they could be waiting for, till the business at Lyme came;



<P>then, indeed, it was clear enough that they must wait till her brain



<P>was set to right.&nbsp; But even then there was something odd in their



<P>way of going on.&nbsp; Instead of staying at Lyme, he went off to Plymouth,



<P>and then he went off to see Edward.&nbsp; When we came back from Minehead



<P>he was gone down to Edward's, and there he has been ever since.



<P>We have seen nothing of him since November.&nbsp; Even Sophy could



<P>not understand it.&nbsp; But now, the matter has take the strangest

turn of all;



<P>for this young lady, the same Miss Musgrove, instead of being



<P>to marry Frederick, is to marry James Benwick.&nbsp; You know James

Benwick."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A little.&nbsp; I am a little acquainted with Captain Benwick."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, she is to marry him.&nbsp; Nay, most likely they are married

already,



<P>for I do not know what they should wait for."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man," said Anne,



<P>"and I understand that he bears an excellent character."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! yes, yes, there is not a word to be said against James Benwick.



<P>He is only a commander, it is true, made last summer, and these are



<P>bad times for getting on, but he has not another fault that I know of.



<P>An excellent, good-hearted fellow, I assure you; a very active,



<P>zealous officer too, which is more than you would think for, perhaps,



<P>for that soft sort of manner does not do him justice."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed you are mistaken there, sir; I should never augur want of spirit



<P>from Captain Benwick's manners.&nbsp; I thought them particularly pleasing,



<P>and I will answer for it, they would generally please."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, well, ladies are the best judges; but James Benwick is rather

too



<P>piano for me; and though very likely it is all our partiality,



<P>Sophy and I cannot help thinking Frederick's manners better than his.



<P>There is something about Frederick more to our taste."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne was caught.&nbsp; She had only meant to oppose the too common idea



<P>of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other,



<P>not at all to represent Captain Benwick's manners as the very best



<P>that could possibly be; and, after a little hesitation,



<P>she was beginning to say, "I was not entering into any comparison



<P>of the two friends," but the Admiral interrupted her with--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And the thing is certainly true.&nbsp; It is not a mere bit of gossip.



<P>We have it from Frederick himself.&nbsp; His sister had a letter



<P>from him yesterday, in which he tells us of it, and he had just had

it



<P>in a letter from Harville, written upon the spot, from Uppercross.



<P>I fancy they are all at Uppercross."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was an opportunity which Anne could not resist; she said, therefore,



<P>"I hope, Admiral, I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain



<P>Wentworth's letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy.



<P>It did seem, last autumn, as if there were an attachment between him



<P>and Louisa Musgrove; but I hope it may be understood to have worn out



<P>on each side equally, and without violence.&nbsp; I hope his letter



<P>does not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not at all, not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur



<P>from beginning to end."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne looked down to hide her smile.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, no; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain; he has



<P>too much spirit for that.&nbsp; If the girl likes another man better,



<P>it is very fit she should have him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Certainly.&nbsp; But what I mean is, that I hope there is nothing



<P>in Captain Wentworth's manner of writing to make you suppose



<P>he thinks himself ill-used by his friend, which might appear,



<P>you know, without its being absolutely said.&nbsp; I should be very

sorry



<P>that such a friendship as has subsisted between him and Captain Benwick



<P>should be destroyed, or even wounded, by a circumstance of this sort."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, yes, I understand you.&nbsp; But there is nothing at all of that

nature



<P>in the letter.&nbsp; He does not give the least fling at Benwick;



<P>does not so much as say, `I wonder at it, I have a reason of my own



<P>for wondering at it.'&nbsp; No, you would not guess, from his way of

writing,



<P>that he had ever thought of this Miss (what's her name?) for himself.



<P>He very handsomely hopes they will be happy together; and there is



<P>nothing very unforgiving in that, I think."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the Admiral meant



<P>to convey, but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther.



<P>She therefore satisfied herself with common-place remarks or quiet



<P>attention, and the Admiral had it all his own way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Poor Frederick!" said he at last.&nbsp; "Now he must begin all over

again



<P>with somebody else.&nbsp; I think we must get him to Bath.&nbsp; Sophy

must write,



<P>and beg him to come to Bath.&nbsp; Here are pretty girls enough, I am

sure.



<P>It would be of no use to go to Uppercross again, for that other



<P>Miss Musgrove, I find, is bespoke by her cousin, the young parson.



<P>Do not you think, Miss Elliot, we had better try to get him to Bath?"
