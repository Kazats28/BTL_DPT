<B>CHAPTER XVI</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous



<P>as herself to avoid a meeting.&nbsp; Their intercourse was painful



<P>enough by letter.&nbsp; How much worse, had they been obliged to meet!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed,



<P>without reproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied



<P>there was a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in



<P>her style, which increased the desirableness of their being separate.--



<P>It might be only her own consciousness; but it seemed as if an



<P>angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had no difficulty in procuring Isabella's invitation;



<P>and she was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it,



<P>without resorting to invention.--There was a tooth amiss.



<P>Harriet really wished, and had wished some time, to consult a dentist.



<P>Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use; any thing of ill



<P>health was a recommendation to her--and though not so fond of a



<P>dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she was quite eager to have Harriet



<P>under her care.--When it was thus settled on her sister's side,



<P>Emma proposed it to her friend, and found her very persuadable.--



<P>Harriet was to go; she was invited for at least a fortnight; she was



<P>to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse's carriage.--It was all arranged,



<P>it was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley's visits; now she



<P>could talk, and she could listen with true happiness, unchecked by



<P>that sense of injustice, of guilt, of something most painful,



<P>which had haunted her when remembering how disappointed a heart was



<P>near her, how much might at that moment, and at a little distance,



<P>be enduring by the feelings which she had led astray herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard's, or in London, made perhaps



<P>an unreasonable difference in Emma's sensations; but she could not



<P>think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment,



<P>which must be averting the past, and carrying her out of herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place



<P>in her mind which Harriet had occupied.&nbsp; There was a communication



<P>before her, one which she only could be competent to make--



<P>the confession of her engagement to her father; but she would



<P>have nothing to do with it at present.--She had resolved to defer



<P>the disclosure till Mrs. Weston were safe and well.&nbsp; No additional



<P>agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved--



<P>and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the



<P>appointed time.--A fortnight, at least, of leisure and peace of mind,



<P>to crown every warmer, but more agitating, delight, should be hers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half



<P>an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.--



<P>She ought to go--and she was longing to see her; the resemblance of



<P>their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill.



<P>It would be a secret satisfaction; but the consciousness of a



<P>similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with



<P>which she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She went--she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had



<P>not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor



<P>Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion,



<P>though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.--



<P>The fear of being still unwelcome, determined her, though assured



<P>of their being at home, to wait in the passage, and send up her name.--



<P>She heard Patty announcing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor



<P>Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.--No; she heard



<P>nothing but the instant reply of, "Beg her to walk up;"--and a moment



<P>afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself, coming eagerly



<P>forward, as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient.--



<P>Emma had never seen her look so well, so lovely, so engaging.



<P>There was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was every



<P>thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.--



<P>She came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low, but very



<P>feeling tone,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This is most kind, indeed!--Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible



<P>for me to express--I hope you will believe--Excuse me for being



<P>so entirely without words."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words,



<P>if the sound of Mrs. Elton's voice from the sitting-room had not



<P>checked her, and made it expedient to compress all her friendly



<P>and all her congratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest



<P>shake of the hand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together.&nbsp; Miss Bates was out,



<P>which accounted for the previous tranquillity.&nbsp; Emma could have



<P>wished Mrs. Elton elsewhere; but she was in a humour to have patience



<P>with every body; and as Mrs. Elton met her with unusual graciousness,



<P>she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton's thoughts,



<P>and understand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits;



<P>it was being in Miss Fairfax's confidence, and fancying herself



<P>acquainted with what was still a secret to other people.



<P>Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face;



<P>and while paying her own compliments to Mrs. Bates, and appearing



<P>to attend to the good old lady's replies, she saw her with a sort



<P>of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently



<P>been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it into the purple



<P>and gold reticule by her side, saying, with significant nods,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We can finish this some other time, you know.&nbsp; You and I shall



<P>not want opportunities.&nbsp; And, in fact, you have heard all the



<P>essential already.&nbsp; I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S.

admits



<P>our apology, and is not offended.&nbsp; You see how delightfully



<P>she writes.&nbsp; Oh! she is a sweet creature!&nbsp; You would have

doated



<P>on her, had you gone.--But not a word more.&nbsp; Let us be discreet--



<P>quite on our good behaviour.--Hush!--You remember those lines--



<P>I forget the poem at this moment:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For when a lady's in the

case,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know all other things

give place."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now I say, my dear, in our case, for lady, read----mum! a word



<P>to the wise.--I am in a fine flow of spirits, an't I?&nbsp; But I want



<P>to set your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.--My representation, you see,



<P>has quite appeased her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And again, on Emma's merely turning her head to look



<P>at Mrs. Bates's knitting, she added, in a half whisper,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I mentioned no names, you will observe.--Oh! no; cautious as



<P>a minister of state.&nbsp; I managed it extremely well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma could not doubt.&nbsp; It was a palpable display, repeated on every



<P>possible occasion.&nbsp; When they had all talked a little while in

harmony



<P>of the weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressed

with,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is



<P>charmingly recovered?--Do not you think her cure does Perry the



<P>highest credit?--(here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.)



<P>Upon my word, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!--



<P>Oh! if you had seen her, as I did, when she was at the worst!"--



<P>And when Mrs. Bates was saying something to Emma, whispered farther,



<P>"We do not say a word of any assistance that Perry might have;



<P>not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor.--Oh! no;



<P>Perry shall have all the credit."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,"



<P>she shortly afterwards began, "since the party to Box Hill.



<P>Very pleasant party.&nbsp; But yet I think there was something wanting.



<P>Things did not seem--that is, there seemed a little cloud upon



<P>the spirits of some.--So it appeared to me at least, but I might



<P>be mistaken.&nbsp; However, I think it answered so far as to tempt one



<P>to go again.&nbsp; What say you both to our collecting the same party,



<P>and exploring to Box Hill again, while the fine weather lasts?--



<P>It must be the same party, you know, quite the same party,



<P>not one exception."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Soon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help being diverted



<P>by the perplexity of her first answer to herself, resulting, she supposed,



<P>from doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say every thing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.--It is impossible



<P>to say--Yes, indeed, I quite understand--dearest Jane's prospects--



<P>that is, I do not mean.--But she is charmingly recovered.--



<P>How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad.--Quite out of my power.--



<P>Such a happy little circle as you find us here.--Yes, indeed.--



<P>Charming young man!--that is--so very friendly; I mean good Mr. Perry!--



<P>such attention to Jane!"--And from her great, her more than commonly



<P>thankful delight towards Mrs. Elton for being there, Emma guessed



<P>that there had been a little show of resentment towards Jane,



<P>from the vicarage quarter, which was now graciously overcome.--



<P>After a few whispers, indeed, which placed it beyond a guess,



<P>Mrs. Elton, speaking louder, said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long,



<P>that anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise;



<P>but, the truth is, that I am waiting for my lord and master.



<P>He promised to join me here, and pay his respects to you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?--



<P>That will be a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like



<P>morning visits, and Mr. Elton's time is so engaged."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Upon my word it is, Miss Bates.--He really is engaged from morning



<P>to night.--There is no end of people's coming to him, on some pretence



<P>or other.--The magistrates, and overseers, and churchwardens,



<P>are always wanting his opinion.&nbsp; They seem not able to do any thing



<P>without him.--`Upon my word, Mr. E.,' I often say, `rather you than

I.--



<P>I do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument,



<P>if I had half so many applicants.'--Bad enough as it is, for I



<P>absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree.--I believe



<P>I have not played a bar this fortnight.--However, he is coming,



<P>I assure you:&nbsp; yes, indeed, on purpose to wait on you all."&nbsp;

And putting



<P>up her hand to screen her words from Emma--"A congratulatory visit,



<P>you know.--Oh! yes, quite indispensable."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Bates looked about her, so happily!--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself



<P>from Knightley; but he and Knightley are shut up together



<P>in deep consultation.--Mr. E. is Knightley's right hand."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, "Is Mr. Elton



<P>gone on foot to Donwell?--He will have a hot walk."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting.



<P>Weston and Cole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only



<P>of those who lead.--I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing



<P>their own way."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Have not you mistaken the day?" said Emma.&nbsp; "I am almost certain



<P>that the meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.--Mr. Knightley



<P>was at Hartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! no, the meeting is certainly to-day," was the abrupt answer,



<P>which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton's side.--



<P>"I do believe," she continued, "this is the most troublesome parish



<P>that ever was.&nbsp; We never heard of such things at Maple Grove."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your parish there was small," said Jane.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subject



<P>talked of."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heard



<P>you speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge;



<P>the only school, and not more than five-and-twenty children."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! you clever creature, that's very true.&nbsp; What a thinking brain



<P>you have!&nbsp; I say, Jane, what a perfect character you and I should

make,



<P>if we could be shaken together.&nbsp; My liveliness and your solidity



<P>would produce perfection.--Not that I presume to insinuate, however,



<P>that some people may not think you perfection already.--But hush!--



<P>not a word, if you please."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her words,



<P>not to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw.



<P>The wish of distinguishing her, as far as civility permitted,



<P>was very evident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Elton made his appearance.&nbsp; His lady greeted him with some



<P>of her sparkling vivacity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an



<P>encumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!--



<P>But you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with.



<P>You knew I should not stir till my lord and master appeared.--



<P>Here have I been sitting this hour, giving these young ladies



<P>a sample of true conjugal obedience--for who can say, you know,



<P>how soon it may be wanted?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away.



<P>His civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his subsequent



<P>object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering,



<P>and the walk he had had for nothing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"When I got to Donwell," said he, "Knightley could not be found.



<P>Very odd! very unaccountable! after the note I sent him this morning,



<P>and the message he returned, that he should certainly be at home



<P>till one."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Donwell!" cried his wife.--"My dear Mr. E., you have not been



<P>to Donwell!--You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, no, that's to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley



<P>to-day on that very account.--Such a dreadful broiling morning!--



<P>I went over the fields too--(speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,)



<P>which made it so much the worse.&nbsp; And then not to find him at home!



<P>I assure you I am not at all pleased.&nbsp; And no apology left, no

message



<P>for me.&nbsp; The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being

expected.--



<P>Very extraordinary!--And nobody knew at all which way he was gone.



<P>Perhaps to Hartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps into his woods.--



<P>Miss Woodhouse, this is not like our friend Knightley!--Can you



<P>explain it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary,



<P>indeed, and that she had not a syllable to say for him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I cannot imagine," said Mrs. Elton, (feeling the indignity as a wife



<P>ought to do,) "I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you,



<P>of all people in the world!&nbsp; The very last person whom one should

expect



<P>to be forgotten!--My dear Mr. E., he must have left a message for you,



<P>I am sure he must.--Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric;--



<P>and his servants forgot it.&nbsp; Depend upon it, that was the case:



<P>and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants, who are all,



<P>I have often observed, extremely awkward and remiss.--I am sure I



<P>would not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard



<P>for any consideration.&nbsp; And as for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds



<P>her very cheap indeed.--She promised Wright a receipt, and never



<P>sent it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I met William Larkins," continued Mr. Elton, "as I got near



<P>the house, and he told me I should not find his master at home,



<P>but I did not believe him.--William seemed rather out of humour.



<P>He did not know what was come to his master lately, he said, but he



<P>could hardly ever get the speech of him.&nbsp; I have nothing to do

with



<P>William's wants, but it really is of very great importance that I



<P>should see Knightley to-day; and it becomes a matter, therefore,



<P>of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk



<P>to no purpose."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly.



<P>In all probability she was at this very time waited for there;



<P>and Mr. Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression



<P>towards Mr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined



<P>to attend her out of the room, to go with her even downstairs;



<P>it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of,



<P>to say,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility.



<P>Had you not been surrounded by other friends, I might have been



<P>tempted to introduce a subject, to ask questions, to speak more



<P>openly than might have been strictly correct.--I feel that I should



<P>certainly have been impertinent."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh!" cried Jane, with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought



<P>infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her



<P>usual composure--"there would have been no danger.&nbsp; The danger



<P>would have been of my wearying you.&nbsp; You could not have gratified



<P>me more than by expressing an interest--.&nbsp; Indeed, Miss Woodhouse,



<P>(speaking more collectedly,) with the consciousness which I



<P>have of misconduct, very great misconduct, it is particularly



<P>consoling to me to know that those of my friends, whose good



<P>opinion is most worth preserving, are not disgusted to such a



<P>degree as to--I have not time for half that I could wish to say.



<P>I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for myself.



<P>I feel it so very due.&nbsp; But, unfortunately--in short, if your



<P>compassion does not stand my friend--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! you are too scrupulous, indeed you are," cried Emma warmly,



<P>and taking her hand.&nbsp; "You owe me no apologies; and every body

to



<P>whom you might be supposed to owe them, is so perfectly satisfied,



<P>so delighted even--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are very kind, but I know what my manners were to you.--



<P>So cold and artificial!--I had always a part to act.--It was a life



<P>of deceit!--I know that I must have disgusted you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Pray say no more.&nbsp; I feel that all the apologies should be on

my side.



<P>Let us forgive each other at once.&nbsp; We must do whatever is to be



<P>done quickest, and I think our feelings will lose no time there.



<P>I hope you have pleasant accounts from Windsor?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And the next news, I suppose, will be, that we are to lose you--



<P>just as I begin to know you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! as to all that, of course nothing can be thought of yet.



<P>I am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs. Campbell."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nothing can be actually settled yet, perhaps," replied Emma,



<P>smiling--"but, excuse me, it must be thought of."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The smile was returned as Jane answered,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are very right; it has been thought of.&nbsp; And I will own



<P>to you, (I am sure it will be safe), that so far as our living



<P>with Mr. Churchill at Enscombe, it is settled.&nbsp; There must be



<P>three months, at least, of deep mourning; but when they are over,



<P>I imagine there will be nothing more to wait for."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you, thank you.--This is just what I wanted to be assured of.--



<P>Oh! if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and open!--



<P>Good-bye, good-bye."

<B>CHAPTER II</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>No misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball.&nbsp; The day approached,



<P>the day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching,



<P>Frank Churchill, in all the certainty of his own self, reached Randalls



<P>before dinner, and every thing was safe.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma.



<P>The room at the Crown was to witness it;--but it would be better



<P>than a common meeting in a crowd.&nbsp; Mr. Weston had been so very



<P>earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible



<P>after themselves, for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the



<P>propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came,



<P>that she could not refuse him, and must therefore spend some quiet



<P>interval in the young man's company.&nbsp; She was to convey Harriet,



<P>and they drove to the Crown in good time, the Randalls party just



<P>sufficiently before them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though



<P>he did not say much, his eyes declared that he meant to have



<P>a delightful evening.&nbsp; They all walked about together, to see



<P>that every thing was as it should be; and within a few minutes



<P>were joined by the contents of another carriage, which Emma



<P>could not hear the sound of at first, without great surprize.



<P>"So unreasonably early!" she was going to exclaim; but she presently



<P>found that it was a family of old friends, who were coming, like herself,



<P>by particular desire, to help Mr. Weston's judgment; and they were



<P>so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins, who had been



<P>entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness,



<P>on the same errand, that it seemed as if half the company might



<P>soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which



<P>Mr. Weston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and



<P>intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes,



<P>was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity.



<P>She liked his open manners, but a little less of open-heartedness



<P>would have made him a higher character.--General benevolence,



<P>but not general friendship, made a man what he ought to be.--



<P>She could fancy such a man.&nbsp; The whole party walked about,



<P>and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing else to do,



<P>formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe in their



<P>various modes, till other subjects were started, that, though May,



<P>a fire in the evening was still very pleasant.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston's fault that the number



<P>of privy councillors was not yet larger.&nbsp; They had stopped



<P>at Mrs. Bates's door to offer the use of their carriage,



<P>but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the Eltons.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Frank was standing by her, but not steadily; there was a restlessness,



<P>which shewed a mind not at ease.&nbsp; He was looking about, he was

going



<P>to the door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,--



<P>impatient to begin, or afraid of being always near her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Elton was spoken of.&nbsp; "I think she must be here soon," said

he.



<P>"I have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much



<P>of her.&nbsp; It cannot be long, I think, before she comes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A carriage was heard.&nbsp; He was on the move immediately;



<P>but coming back, said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her.&nbsp; I have never

seen



<P>either Mr. or Mrs. Elton.&nbsp; I have no business to put myself forward."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties

passed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!" said Mr. Weston, looking about.



<P>"We thought you were to bring them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The mistake had been slight.&nbsp; The carriage was sent for them now.



<P>Emma longed to know what Frank's first opinion of Mrs. Elton



<P>might be; how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress,



<P>and her smiles of graciousness.&nbsp; He was immediately qualifying



<P>himself to form an opinion, by giving her very proper attention,



<P>after the introduction had passed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In a few minutes the carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.--



<P>"I will see that there are umbrellas, sir," said Frank to his father:



<P>"Miss Bates must not be forgotten:"&nbsp; and away he went.&nbsp; Mr.

Weston



<P>was following; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her



<P>opinion of his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young



<P>man himself, though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out



<P>of hearing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston.&nbsp; You know I candidly

told



<P>you I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am



<P>extremely pleased with him.--You may believe me.&nbsp; I never compliment.



<P>I think him a very handsome young man, and his manners are precisely



<P>what I like and approve--so truly the gentleman, without the least



<P>conceit or puppyism.&nbsp; You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies--



<P>quite a horror of them.&nbsp; They were never tolerated at Maple Grove.



<P>Neither Mr. Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them; and we



<P>used sometimes to say very cutting things!&nbsp; Selina, who is mild

almost



<P>to a fault, bore with them much better."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While she talked of his son, Mr. Weston's attention was chained;



<P>but when she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were



<P>ladies just arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must



<P>hurry away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston.&nbsp; "I have no doubt of its being



<P>our carriage with Miss Bates and Jane.&nbsp; Our coachman and horses

are



<P>so extremely expeditious!--I believe we drive faster than any body.--



<P>What a pleasure it is to send one's carriage for a friend!--



<P>I understand you were so kind as to offer, but another time it



<P>will be quite unnecessary.&nbsp; You may be very sure I shall always



<P>take care of them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen,



<P>walked into the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much



<P>her duty as Mrs. Weston's to receive them.&nbsp; Her gestures and



<P>movements might be understood by any one who looked on like Emma;



<P>but her words, every body's words, were soon lost under the



<P>incessant flow of Miss Bates, who came in talking, and had not



<P>finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted



<P>into the circle at the fire.&nbsp; As the door opened she was heard,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So very obliging of you!--No rain at all.&nbsp; Nothing to signify.



<P>I do not care for myself.&nbsp; Quite thick shoes.&nbsp; And Jane declares--



<P>Well!--(as soon as she was within the door) Well!&nbsp; This is brilliant



<P>indeed!--This is admirable!--Excellently contrived, upon my word.



<P>Nothing wanting.&nbsp; Could not have imagined it.--So well lighted

up!--



<P>Jane, Jane, look!--did you ever see any thing?&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Mr. Weston,



<P>you must really have had Aladdin's lamp.&nbsp; Good Mrs. Stokes



<P>would not know her own room again.&nbsp; I saw her as I came in;



<P>she was standing in the entrance.&nbsp; `Oh!&nbsp; Mrs. Stokes,' said

I--



<P>but I had not time for more."&nbsp; She was now met by Mrs. Weston.--



<P>"Very well, I thank you, ma'am. I hope you are quite well.



<P>Very happy to hear it.&nbsp; So afraid you might have a headach!--



<P>seeing you pass by so often, and knowing how much trouble you must have.



<P>Delighted to hear it indeed.&nbsp; Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged



<P>to you for the carriage!--excellent time.&nbsp; Jane and I quite ready.



<P>Did not keep the horses a moment.&nbsp; Most comfortable carriage.--



<P>Oh! and I am sure our thanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score.



<P>Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note, or we should have been.--



<P>But two such offers in one day!--Never were such neighbours.



<P>I said to my mother, `Upon my word, ma'am--.'&nbsp; Thank you, my mother



<P>is remarkably well.&nbsp; Gone to Mr. Woodhouse's. I made her take



<P>her shawl--for the evenings are not warm--her large new shawl--



<P>Mrs. Dixon's wedding-present.--So kind of her to think of my mother!



<P>Bought at Weymouth, you know--Mr. Dixon's choice.&nbsp; There were



<P>three others, Jane says, which they hesitated about some time.



<P>Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive.&nbsp; My dear Jane,



<P>are you sure you did not wet your feet?--It was but a drop or two,



<P>but I am so afraid:--but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely--



<P>and there was a mat to step upon--I shall never forget his



<P>extreme politeness.--Oh!&nbsp; Mr. Frank Churchill, I must tell you



<P>my mother's spectacles have never been in fault since; the rivet



<P>never came out again.&nbsp; My mother often talks of your good-nature.



<P>Does not she, Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?--



<P>Ah! here's Miss Woodhouse.--Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do you do?--



<P>Very well I thank you, quite well.&nbsp; This is meeting quite in fairy-land!--



<P>Such a transformation!--Must not compliment, I know (eyeing Emma



<P>most complacently)--that would be rude--but upon my word, Miss Woodhouse,



<P>you do look--how do you like Jane's hair?--You are a judge.--



<P>She did it all herself.&nbsp; Quite wonderful how she does her hair!--



<P>No hairdresser from London I think could.--Ah! Dr. Hughes I declare--



<P>and Mrs. Hughes.&nbsp; Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for



<P>a moment.--How do you do?&nbsp; How do you do?--Very well, I thank you.



<P>This is delightful, is not it?--Where's dear Mr. Richard?--



<P>Oh! there he is.&nbsp; Don't disturb him.&nbsp; Much better employed

talking



<P>to the young ladies.&nbsp; How do you do, Mr. Richard?--I saw you the



<P>other day as you rode through the town--Mrs. Otway, I protest!--



<P>and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.--Such a host



<P>of friends!--and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!--How do you do?&nbsp; How

do



<P>you all do?--Quite well, I am much obliged to you.&nbsp; Never better.--



<P>Don't I hear another carriage?--Who can this be?--very likely the



<P>worthy Coles.--Upon my word, this is charming to be standing about



<P>among such friends!&nbsp; And such a noble fire!--I am quite roasted.



<P>No coffee, I thank you, for me--never take coffee.--A little tea



<P>if you please, sir, by and bye,--no hurry--Oh! here it comes.



<P>Every thing so good!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as Miss



<P>Bates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the



<P>discourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little



<P>way behind her.--He was thoughtful.&nbsp; Whether he were overhearing

too,



<P>she could not determine.&nbsp; After a good many compliments to Jane



<P>on her dress and look, compliments very quietly and properly taken,



<P>Mrs. Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself--



<P>and it was, "How do you like my gown?--How do you like my trimming?--



<P>How has Wright done my hair?"--with many other relative questions,



<P>all answered with patient politeness.&nbsp; Mrs. Elton then said,



<P>"Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do--but upon such



<P>an occasion as this, when every body's eyes are so much upon me,



<P>and in compliment to the Westons--who I have no doubt are giving



<P>this ball chiefly to do me honour--I would not wish to be inferior



<P>to others.&nbsp; And I see very few pearls in the room except mine.--



<P>So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.--We shall see



<P>if our styles suit.--A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill.



<P>I like him very well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could



<P>not but imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want



<P>to hear more;--and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while,



<P>till another suspension brought Mrs. Elton's tones again distinctly



<P>forward.--Mr. Elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?--



<P>I was this moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be



<P>impatient for tidings of us."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Jane!"--repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize and displeasure.--



<P>"That is easy--but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it, I suppose."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How do you like Mrs. Elton?" said Emma in a whisper.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not at all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are ungrateful."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ungrateful!--What do you mean?"&nbsp; Then changing from a frown to



<P>a smile--"No, do not tell me--I do not want to know what you mean.--



<P>Where is my father?--When are we to begin dancing?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour.



<P>He walked off to find his father, but was quickly back again with both



<P>Mr. and Mrs. Weston.&nbsp; He had met with them in a little perplexity,



<P>which must be laid before Emma.&nbsp; It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston



<P>that Mrs. Elton must be asked to begin the ball; that she would



<P>expect it; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma



<P>that distinction.--Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And what are we to do for a proper partner for her?" said Mr. Weston.



<P>"She will think Frank ought to ask her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise;



<P>and boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most



<P>perfect approbation of--and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was



<P>wanting him to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business



<P>was to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.--



<P>Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss



<P>Woodhouse followed.&nbsp; Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton,



<P>though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her.



<P>It was almost enough to make her think of marrying.&nbsp; Mrs. Elton

had



<P>undoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified;



<P>for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill, she could



<P>not lose by the change.&nbsp; Mr. Weston might be his son's superior.--



<P>In spite of this little rub, however, Emma was smiling with enjoyment,



<P>delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming,



<P>and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her.--



<P>She was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley's not dancing than by any



<P>thing else.--There he was, among the standers-by, where he ought not



<P>to be; he ought to be dancing,--not classing himself with the husbands,



<P>and fathers, and whist-players, who were pretending to feel an interest



<P>in the dance till their rubbers were made up,--so young as he looked!--



<P>He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere,



<P>than where he had placed himself.&nbsp; His tall, firm, upright figure,



<P>among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men,



<P>was such as Emma felt must draw every body's eyes; and, excepting her



<P>own partner, there was not one among the whole row of young men



<P>who could be compared with him.--He moved a few steps nearer,



<P>and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike



<P>a manner, with what natural grace, he must have danced, would he



<P>but take the trouble.--Whenever she caught his eye, she forced him



<P>to smile; but in general he was looking grave.&nbsp; She wished he could



<P>love a ballroom better, and could like Frank Churchill better.--



<P>He seemed often observing her.&nbsp; She must not flatter herself that

he



<P>thought of her dancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour,



<P>she did not feel afraid.&nbsp; There was nothing like flirtation between



<P>her and her partner.&nbsp; They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends,



<P>than lovers.&nbsp; That Frank Churchill thought less of her than he

had done,



<P>was indubitable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The ball proceeded pleasantly.&nbsp; The anxious cares, the incessant



<P>attentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away.&nbsp; Every body



<P>seemed happy; and the praise of being a delightful ball,



<P>which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be,



<P>was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this.



<P>Of very important, very recordable events, it was not more productive



<P>than such meetings usually are.&nbsp; There was one, however, which

Emma



<P>thought something of.--The two last dances before supper were begun,



<P>and Harriet had no partner;--the only young lady sitting down;--



<P>and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers, that how there



<P>could be any one disengaged was the wonder!--But Emma's wonder



<P>lessened soon afterwards, on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about.



<P>He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided:



<P>she was sure he would not--and she was expecting him every moment to



<P>escape into the card-room.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Escape, however, was not his plan.&nbsp; He came to the part of the

room



<P>where the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about



<P>in front of them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution



<P>of maintaining it.&nbsp; He did not omit being sometimes directly



<P>before Miss Smith, or speaking to those who were close to her.--



<P>Emma saw it.&nbsp; She was not yet dancing; she was working her way



<P>up from the bottom, and had therefore leisure to look around,



<P>and by only turning her head a little she saw it all.&nbsp; When she

was



<P>half-way up the set, the whole group were exactly behind her, and she



<P>would no longer allow her eyes to watch; but Mr. Elton was so near,



<P>that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took



<P>place between him and Mrs. Weston; and she perceived that his wife,



<P>who was standing immediately above her, was not only listening also,



<P>but even encouraging him by significant glances.--The kind-hearted,



<P>gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join him and say, "Do not



<P>you dance, Mr. Elton?" to which his prompt reply was, "Most readily,



<P>Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Me!--oh! no--I would get you a better partner than myself.



<P>I am no dancer."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance," said he, "I shall have great pleasure,



<P>I am sure--for, though beginning to feel myself rather an old married

man,



<P>and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very great



<P>pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs. Gilbert."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady



<P>disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing--Miss Smith."



<P>"Miss Smith!--oh!--I had not observed.--You are extremely obliging--



<P>and if I were not an old married man.--But my dancing days are over,



<P>Mrs. Weston.&nbsp; You will excuse me.&nbsp; Any thing else I should

be most happy



<P>to do, at your command--but my dancing days are over."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what



<P>surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat.



<P>This was Mr. Elton! the amiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.--



<P>She looked round for a moment; he had joined Mr. Knightley at a



<P>little distance, and was arranging himself for settled conversation,



<P>while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She would not look again.&nbsp; Her heart was in a glow, and she feared



<P>her face might be as hot.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In another moment a happier sight caught her;--Mr. Knightley



<P>leading Harriet to the set!--Never had she been more surprized,



<P>seldom more delighted, than at that instant.&nbsp; She was all pleasure



<P>and gratitude, both for Harriet and herself, and longed to be



<P>thanking him; and though too distant for speech, her countenance



<P>said much, as soon as she could catch his eye again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it,



<P>extremely good; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky,



<P>if it had not been for the cruel state of things before, and for



<P>the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction



<P>which her happy features announced.&nbsp; It was not thrown away on

her,



<P>she bounded higher than ever, flew farther down the middle,



<P>and was in a continual course of smiles.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted)



<P>very foolish.&nbsp; She did not think he was quite so hardened as his

wife,



<P>though growing very like her;--she spoke some of her feelings,



<P>by observing audibly to her partner,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!--Very goodnatured,



<P>I declare."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Supper was announced.&nbsp; The move began; and Miss Bates might be



<P>heard from that moment, without interruption, till her being



<P>seated at table and taking up her spoon.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?--Here is your tippet.



<P>Mrs. Weston begs you to put on your tippet.&nbsp; She says she is afraid



<P>there will be draughts in the passage, though every thing has



<P>been done--One door nailed up--Quantities of matting--My dear Jane,



<P>indeed you must.&nbsp; Mr. Churchill, oh! you are too obliging!



<P>How well you put it on!--so gratified!&nbsp; Excellent dancing indeed!--



<P>Yes, my dear, I ran home, as I said I should, to help grandmama



<P>to bed, and got back again, and nobody missed me.--I set off without



<P>saying a word, just as I told you.&nbsp; Grandmama was quite well,



<P>had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a vast deal of chat,



<P>and backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs, biscuits and baked apples



<P>and wine before she came away:&nbsp; amazing luck in some of her throws:



<P>and she inquired a great deal about you, how you were amused,



<P>and who were your partners.&nbsp; `Oh!' said I, `I shall not forestall

Jane;



<P>I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love to tell you



<P>all about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr. Elton,



<P>I do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.'



<P>My dear sir, you are too obliging.--Is there nobody you would



<P>not rather?--I am not helpless.&nbsp; Sir, you are most kind.&nbsp;

Upon my word,



<P>Jane on one arm, and me on the other!--Stop, stop, let us stand



<P>a little back, Mrs. Elton is going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant



<P>she looks!--Beautiful lace!--Now we all follow in her train.



<P>Quite the queen of the evening!--Well, here we are at the passage.



<P>Two steps, Jane, take care of the two steps.&nbsp; Oh! no, there is



<P>but one.&nbsp; Well, I was persuaded there were two.&nbsp; How very

odd!



<P>I was convinced there were two, and there is but one.&nbsp; I never

saw any



<P>thing equal to the comfort and style--Candles everywhere.--I was telling



<P>you of your grandmama, Jane,--There was a little disappointment.--



<P>The baked apples and biscuits, excellent in their way, you know;



<P>but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus



<P>brought in at first, and good Mr. Woodhouse, not thinking the



<P>asparagus quite boiled enough, sent it all out again.&nbsp; Now there



<P>is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus--



<P>so she was rather disappointed, but we agreed we would not speak of

it



<P>to any body, for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse,



<P>who would be so very much concerned!--Well, this is brilliant!



<P>I am all amazement! could not have supposed any thing!--Such



<P>elegance and profusion!--I have seen nothing like it since--



<P>Well, where shall we sit? where shall we sit?&nbsp; Anywhere, so that



<P>Jane is not in a draught.&nbsp; Where I sit is of no consequence.



<P>Oh! do you recommend this side?--Well, I am sure, Mr. Churchill--



<P>only it seems too good--but just as you please.&nbsp; What you direct



<P>in this house cannot be wrong.&nbsp; Dear Jane, how shall we ever



<P>recollect half the dishes for grandmama?&nbsp; Soup too!&nbsp; Bless

me!



<P>I should not be helped so soon, but it smells most excellent, and I



<P>cannot help beginning."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till



<P>after supper; but, when they were all in the ballroom again,



<P>her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked.



<P>He was warm in his reprobation of Mr. Elton's conduct; it had been



<P>unpardonable rudeness; and Mrs. Elton's looks also received the due



<P>share of censure.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They aimed at wounding more than Harriet," said he.&nbsp; "Emma, why



<P>is it that they are your enemies?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving



<P>no answer, added, "She ought not to be angry with you, I suspect,



<P>whatever he may be.--To that surmise, you say nothing, of course;



<P>but confess, Emma, that you did want him to marry Harriet."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I did," replied Emma, "and they cannot forgive me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He shook his head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it,



<P>and he only said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall not scold you.&nbsp; I leave you to your own reflections."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Can you trust me with such flatterers?--Does my vain spirit ever



<P>tell me I am wrong?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.--If one leads



<P>you wrong, I am sure the other tells you of it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton.



<P>There is a littleness about him which you discovered, and which I



<P>did not:&nbsp; and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet.



<P>It was through a series of strange blunders!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you the justice



<P>to say, that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen

for



<P>himself.--Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, which Mrs. Elton



<P>is totally without.&nbsp; An unpretending, single-minded, artless girl--



<P>infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such



<P>a woman as Mrs. Elton.&nbsp; I found Harriet more conversable than I

expected."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma was extremely gratified.--They were interrupted by the bustle



<P>of Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all doing?--



<P>Come Emma, set your companions the example.&nbsp; Every body is lazy!



<P>Every body is asleep!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am ready," said Emma, "whenever I am wanted."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Whom are you going to dance with?" asked Mr. Knightley.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She hesitated a moment, and then replied, "With you, if you will



<P>ask me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Will you?" said he, offering his hand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed I will.&nbsp; You have shewn that you can dance, and you know

we



<P>are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Brother and sister! no, indeed."

<B>CHAPTER III</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>This little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable



<P>pleasure.&nbsp; It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball,



<P>which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.--She was



<P>extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting



<P>the Eltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so



<P>much alike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession in her favour,



<P>was peculiarly gratifying.&nbsp; The impertinence of the Eltons, which

for



<P>a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her evening, had been



<P>the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she looked



<P>forward to another happy result--the cure of Harriet's infatuation.--



<P>From Harriet's manner of speaking of the circumstance before they



<P>quitted the ballroom, she had strong hopes.&nbsp; It seemed as if her

eyes



<P>were suddenly opened, and she were enabled to see that Mr. Elton



<P>was not the superior creature she had believed him.&nbsp; The fever



<P>was over, and Emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being



<P>quickened again by injurious courtesy.&nbsp; She depended on the evil



<P>feelings of the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed



<P>neglect that could be farther requisite.--Harriet rational,



<P>Frank Churchill not too much in love, and Mr. Knightley not



<P>wanting to quarrel with her, how very happy a summer must be before

her!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was not to see Frank Churchill this morning.&nbsp; He had told



<P>her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping



<P>at Hartfield, as he was to be at home by the middle of the day.



<P>She did not regret it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Having arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them

all



<P>to rights, she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened

up



<P>for the demands of the two little boys, as well as of their grandpapa,



<P>when the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two persons entered



<P>whom she had never less expected to see together--Frank Churchill,



<P>with Harriet leaning on his arm--actually Harriet!--A moment



<P>sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened.



<P>Harriet looked white and frightened, and he was trying to cheer her.--



<P>The iron gates and the front-door were not twenty yards asunder;--



<P>they were all three soon in the hall, and Harriet immediately sinking



<P>into a chair fainted away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered,



<P>and surprizes be explained.&nbsp; Such events are very interesting,



<P>but the suspense of them cannot last long.&nbsp; A few minutes made

Emma



<P>acquainted with the whole.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at



<P>Mrs. Goddard's, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together,



<P>and taken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public



<P>enough for safety, had led them into alarm.--About half a mile



<P>beyond Highbury, making a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms



<P>on each side, it became for a considerable stretch very retired;



<P>and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it,



<P>they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them,



<P>on a broader patch of greensward by the side, a party of gipsies.



<P>A child on the watch, came towards them to beg; and Miss Bickerton,



<P>excessively frightened, gave a great scream, and calling on Harriet



<P>to follow her, ran up a steep bank, cleared a slight hedge at the top,



<P>and made the best of her way by a short cut back to Highbury.



<P>But poor Harriet could not follow.&nbsp; She had suffered very much



<P>from cramp after dancing, and her first attempt to mount the bank



<P>brought on such a return of it as made her absolutely powerless--



<P>and in this state, and exceedingly terrified, she had been obliged



<P>to remain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>How the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been



<P>more courageous, must be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack



<P>could not be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a



<P>dozen children, headed by a stout woman and a great boy, all clamorous,



<P>and impertinent in look, though not absolutely in word.--More and



<P>more frightened, she immediately promised them money, and taking out



<P>her purse, gave them a shilling, and begged them not to want more,



<P>or to use her ill.--She was then able to walk, though but slowly,



<P>and was moving away--but her terror and her purse were too tempting,



<P>and she was followed, or rather surrounded, by the whole gang,



<P>demanding more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In this state Frank Churchill had found her, she trembling



<P>and conditioning, they loud and insolent.&nbsp; By a most fortunate



<P>chance his leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him



<P>to her assistance at this critical moment.&nbsp; The pleasantness



<P>of the morning had induced him to walk forward, and leave his



<P>horses to meet him by another road, a mile or two beyond Highbury--



<P>and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before



<P>of Miss Bates, and to have forgotten to restore them, he had



<P>been obliged to stop at her door, and go in for a few minutes:



<P>he was therefore later than he had intended; and being on foot,



<P>was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them.



<P>The terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet



<P>was then their own portion.&nbsp; He had left them completely frightened;



<P>and Harriet eagerly clinging to him, and hardly able to speak,



<P>had just strength enough to reach Hartfield, before her spirits



<P>were quite overcome.&nbsp; It was his idea to bring her to Hartfield:



<P>he had thought of no other place.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was the amount of the whole story,--of his communication and



<P>of Harriet's as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech.--



<P>He dared not stay longer than to see her well; these several delays



<P>left him not another minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give



<P>assurance of her safety to Mrs. Goddard, and notice of there



<P>being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley,



<P>he set off, with all the grateful blessings that she could utter



<P>for her friend and herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Such an adventure as this,--a fine young man and a lovely young



<P>woman thrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting



<P>certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain.



<P>So Emma thought, at least.&nbsp; Could a linguist, could a grammarian,



<P>could even a mathematician have seen what she did, have witnessed their



<P>appearance together, and heard their history of it, without feeling



<P>that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting



<P>to each other?--How much more must an imaginist, like herself,



<P>be on fire with speculation and foresight!--especially with such



<P>a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was a very extraordinary thing!&nbsp; Nothing of the sort had ever



<P>occurred before to any young ladies in the place, within her memory;



<P>no rencontre, no alarm of the kind;--and now it had happened



<P>to the very person, and at the very hour, when the other very



<P>person was chancing to pass by to rescue her!--It certainly



<P>was very extraordinary!--And knowing, as she did, the favourable



<P>state of mind of each at this period, it struck her the more.



<P>He was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself,



<P>she just recovering from her mania for Mr. Elton.&nbsp; It seemed as

if



<P>every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences.



<P>It was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly



<P>recommending each to the other.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the few minutes' conversation which she had yet had with him,



<P>while Harriet had been partially insensible, he had spoken of her terror,



<P>her naivete, her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm, with a



<P>sensibility amused and delighted; and just at last, after Harriet's



<P>own account had been given, he had expressed his indignation



<P>at the abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms.



<P>Every thing was to take its natural course, however, neither impelled



<P>nor assisted.&nbsp; She would not stir a step, nor drop a hint.



<P>No, she had had enough of interference.&nbsp; There could be no harm



<P>in a scheme, a mere passive scheme.&nbsp; It was no more than a wish.



<P>Beyond it she would on no account proceed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma's first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge



<P>of what had passed,--aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion:



<P>but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible.&nbsp; Within

half



<P>an hour it was known all over Highbury.&nbsp; It was the very event



<P>to engage those who talk most, the young and the low; and all



<P>the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of



<P>frightful news.&nbsp; The last night's ball seemed lost in the gipsies.



<P>Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as he sat, and, as Emma had foreseen,



<P>would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go



<P>beyond the shrubbery again.&nbsp; It was some comfort to him that many



<P>inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse (for his neighbours



<P>knew that he loved to be inquired after), as well as Miss Smith,



<P>were coming in during the rest of the day; and he had the pleasure



<P>of returning for answer, that they were all very indifferent--



<P>which, though not exactly true, for she was perfectly well,



<P>and Harriet not much otherwise, Emma would not interfere with.



<P>She had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such



<P>a man, for she hardly knew what indisposition was; and if he did not



<P>invent illnesses for her, she could make no figure in a message.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice; they took



<P>themselves off in a hurry.&nbsp; The young ladies of Highbury might

have



<P>walked again in safety before their panic began, and the whole



<P>history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma



<P>and her nephews:--in her imagination it maintained its ground,



<P>and Henry and John were still asking every day for the story of



<P>Harriet and the gipsies, and still tenaciously setting her right



<P>if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Mrs. Weston's friends were all made happy by her safety;



<P>and if the satisfaction of her well-doing could be increased



<P>to Emma, it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl.



<P>She had been decided in wishing for a Miss Weston.&nbsp; She would



<P>not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match



<P>for her, hereafter, with either of Isabella's sons; but she was



<P>convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best.



<P>It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, as he grew older--



<P>and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years hence--to have



<P>his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense, the freaks



<P>and the fancies of a child never banished from home; and Mrs. Weston--



<P>no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her; and it



<P>would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach,



<P>should not have their powers in exercise again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me,"



<P>she continued--"like La Baronne d'Almane on La Comtesse d'Ostalis,



<P>in Madame de Genlis' Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see



<P>her own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That is," replied Mr. Knightley, "she will indulge her even more



<P>than she did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at all.



<P>It will be the only difference."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Poor child!" cried Emma; "at that rate, what will become of her?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nothing very bad.--The fate of thousands.&nbsp; She will be disagreeable



<P>in infancy, and correct herself as she grows older.&nbsp; I am losing



<P>all my bitterness against spoilt children, my dearest Emma.



<P>I, who am owing all my happiness to you, would not it be horrible



<P>ingratitude in me to be severe on them?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma laughed, and replied:&nbsp; "But I had the assistance of all



<P>your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people.



<P>I doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you?--I have no doubt.&nbsp; Nature gave you understanding:--



<P>Miss Taylor gave you principles.&nbsp; You must have done well.



<P>My interference was quite as likely to do harm as good.&nbsp; It was



<P>very natural for you to say, what right has he to lecture me?--



<P>and I am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done



<P>in a disagreeable manner.&nbsp; I do not believe I did you any good.



<P>The good was all to myself, by making you an object of the tenderest



<P>affection to me.&nbsp; I could not think about you so much without doating



<P>on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many errors,



<P>have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am sure you were of use to me," cried Emma.&nbsp; "I was very often



<P>influenced rightly by you--oftener than I would own at the time.



<P>I am very sure you did me good.&nbsp; And if poor little Anna Weston

is



<P>to be spoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much



<P>for her as you have done for me, except falling in love with her



<P>when she is thirteen."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one



<P>of your saucy looks--`Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so;



<P>papa says I may, or I have Miss Taylor's leave'--something which,



<P>you knew, I did not approve.&nbsp; In such cases my interference was

giving



<P>you two bad feelings instead of one."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What an amiable creature I was!--No wonder you should hold



<P>my speeches in such affectionate remembrance."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"`Mr. Knightley.'--You always called me, `Mr. Knightley;' and,



<P>from habit, it has not so very formal a sound.--And yet it is formal.



<P>I want you to call me something else, but I do not know what."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I remember once calling you `George,' in one of my amiable fits,



<P>about ten years ago.&nbsp; I did it because I thought it would offend

you;



<P>but, as you made no objection, I never did it again."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And cannot you call me `George' now?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Impossible!--I never can call you any thing but `Mr. Knightley.'



<P>I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton,



<P>by calling you Mr. K.--But I will promise," she added presently,



<P>laughing and blushing--"I will promise to call you once by your



<P>Christian name.&nbsp; I do not say when, but perhaps you may guess



<P>where;--in the building in which N. takes M. for better, for worse."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one



<P>important service which his better sense would have rendered her,



<P>to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all



<P>her womanly follies--her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith;



<P>but it was too tender a subject.--She could not enter on it.--



<P>Harriet was very seldom mentioned between them.&nbsp; This, on his side,



<P>might merely proceed from her not being thought of; but Emma



<P>was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy, and a suspicion,



<P>from some appearances, that their friendship were declining.



<P>She was aware herself, that, parting under any other circumstances,



<P>they certainly should have corresponded more, and that her



<P>intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did,



<P>on Isabella's letters.&nbsp; He might observe that it was so.&nbsp;

The pain



<P>of being obliged to practise concealment towards him, was very little



<P>inferior to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could



<P>be expected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits,



<P>which appeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to



<P>be consulted; but, since that business had been over, she did not



<P>appear to find Harriet different from what she had known her before.--



<P>Isabella, to be sure, was no very quick observer; yet if Harriet



<P>had not been equal to playing with the children, it would not have



<P>escaped her.&nbsp; Emma's comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried

on,



<P>by Harriet's being to stay longer; her fortnight was likely to be



<P>a month at least.&nbsp; Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down



<P>in August, and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"John does not even mention your friend," said Mr. Knightley.



<P>"Here is his answer, if you like to see it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage.



<P>Emma accepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all alive



<P>to know what he would say about it, and not at all checked by hearing



<P>that her friend was unmentioned.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"John enters like a brother into my happiness," continued Mr. Knightley,



<P>"but he is no complimenter; and though I well know him to have,



<P>likewise, a most brotherly affection for you, he is so far from



<P>making flourishes, that any other young woman might think him rather



<P>cool in her praise.&nbsp; But I am not afraid of your seeing what he

writes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He writes like a sensible man," replied Emma, when she had read



<P>the letter.&nbsp; "I honour his sincerity.&nbsp; It is very plain that

he



<P>considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side,



<P>but that he is not without hope of my growing, in time, as worthy



<P>of your affection, as you think me already.&nbsp; Had he said any thing



<P>to bear a different construction, I should not have believed him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My Emma, he means no such thing.&nbsp; He only means--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two,"



<P>interrupted she, with a sort of serious smile--"much less, perhaps,



<P>than he is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve



<P>on the subject."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Emma, my dear Emma--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh!" she cried with more thorough gaiety, "if you fancy your



<P>brother does not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in



<P>the secret, and hear his opinion.&nbsp; Depend upon it, he will be much



<P>farther from doing you justice.&nbsp; He will think all the happiness,



<P>all the advantage, on your side of the question; all the merit



<P>on mine.&nbsp; I wish I may not sink into `poor Emma' with him at once.--



<P>His tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah!" he cried, "I wish your father might be half as easily convinced



<P>as John will be, of our having every right that equal worth can give,



<P>to be happy together.&nbsp; I am amused by one part of John's letter--



<P>did you notice it?--where he says, that my information did not take



<P>him wholly by surprize, that he was rather in expectation of hearing



<P>something of the kind."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If I understand your brother, he only means so far as your having



<P>some thoughts of marrying.&nbsp; He had no idea of me.&nbsp; He seems

perfectly



<P>unprepared for that."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, yes--but I am amused that he should have seen so far into



<P>my feelings.&nbsp; What has he been judging by?--I am not conscious



<P>of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare



<P>him at this time for my marrying any more than at another.--



<P>But it was so, I suppose.&nbsp; I dare say there was a difference when

I



<P>was staying with them the other day.&nbsp; I believe I did not play



<P>with the children quite so much as usual.&nbsp; I remember one evening



<P>the poor boys saying, `Uncle seems always tired now.'"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other persons'



<P>reception of it tried.&nbsp; As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently



<P>recovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse's visits, Emma having it in view



<P>that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause,



<P>resolved first to announce it at home, and then at Randalls.--



<P>But how to break it to her father at last!--She had bound herself



<P>to do it, in such an hour of Mr. Knightley's absence, or when it



<P>came to the point her heart would have failed her, and she must



<P>have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to come at such a time,



<P>and follow up the beginning she was to make.--She was forced



<P>to speak, and to speak cheerfully too.&nbsp; She must not make it a

more



<P>decided subject of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself.



<P>She must not appear to think it a misfortune.--With all the spirits



<P>she could command, she prepared him first for something strange,



<P>and then, in a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation



<P>could be obtained--which, she trusted, would be attended with



<P>no difficulty, since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all--



<P>she and Mr. Knightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield



<P>would receive the constant addition of that person's company



<P>whom she knew he loved, next to his daughters and Mrs. Weston,



<P>best in the world.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Poor man!--it was at first a considerable shock to him, and he tried



<P>earnestly to dissuade her from it.&nbsp; She was reminded, more than

once,



<P>of having always said she would never marry, and assured that it



<P>would be a great deal better for her to remain single; and told of



<P>poor Isabella, and poor Miss Taylor.--But it would not do.&nbsp; Emma

hung



<P>about him affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that



<P>he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages



<P>taking them from Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change:



<P>but she was not going from Hartfield; she should be always there;



<P>she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but



<P>for the better; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal



<P>the happier for having Mr. Knightley always at hand, when he were once



<P>got used to the idea.--Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?--



<P>He would not deny that he did, she was sure.--Whom did he ever want



<P>to consult on business but Mr. Knightley?--Who was so useful to him,



<P>who so ready to write his letters, who so glad to assist him?--



<P>Who so cheerful, so attentive, so attached to him?--Would not he



<P>like to have him always on the spot?--Yes.&nbsp; That was all very true.



<P>Mr. Knightley could not be there too often; he should be glad to see



<P>him every day;--but they did see him every day as it was.--Why could



<P>not they go on as they had done?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome,



<P>the idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.--



<P>To Emma's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley's,



<P>whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome;



<P>and he was soon used to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.--



<P>They had all the assistance which Isabella could give, by letters



<P>of the strongest approbation; and Mrs. Weston was ready,



<P>on the first meeting, to consider the subject in the most



<P>serviceable light--first, as a settled, and, secondly, as a good one--



<P>well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations



<P>to Mr. Woodhouse's mind.--It was agreed upon, as what was to be;



<P>and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that



<P>it would be for his happiness; and having some feelings himself



<P>which almost admitted it, he began to think that some time or other--



<P>in another year or two, perhaps--it might not be so very bad



<P>if the marriage did take place.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that she



<P>said to him in favour of the event.--She had been extremely surprized,



<P>never more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to her;



<P>but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had



<P>no scruple in urging him to the utmost.--She had such a regard



<P>for Mr. Knightley, as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma;



<P>and it was in every respect so proper, suitable, and unexceptionable



<P>a connexion, and in one respect, one point of the highest importance,



<P>so peculiarly eligible, so singularly fortunate, that now it seemed



<P>as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature,



<P>and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having



<P>thought of it, and wished it long ago.--How very few of those men



<P>in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own



<P>home for Hartfield!&nbsp; And who but Mr. Knightley could know and bear



<P>with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an arrangement desirable!--



<P>The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had been always



<P>felt in her husband's plans and her own, for a marriage between Frank



<P>and Emma.&nbsp; How to settle the claims of Enscombe and Hartfield had



<P>been a continual impediment--less acknowledged by Mr. Weston than



<P>by herself--but even he had never been able to finish the subject



<P>better than by saying--"Those matters will take care of themselves;



<P>the young people will find a way."&nbsp; But here there was nothing

to be



<P>shifted off in a wild speculation on the future.&nbsp; It was all right,



<P>all open, all equal.&nbsp; No sacrifice on any side worth the name.



<P>It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself,



<P>and without one real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Weston, with her baby on her knee, indulging in such reflections



<P>as these, was one of the happiest women in the world.&nbsp; If any thing



<P>could increase her delight, it was perceiving that the baby would



<P>soon have outgrown its first set of caps.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread;



<P>and Mr. Weston had his five minutes share of it; but five minutes



<P>were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind.--



<P>He saw the advantages of the match, and rejoiced in them with all



<P>the constancy of his wife; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing;



<P>and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he



<P>had always foreseen it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is to be a secret, I conclude," said he.&nbsp; "These matters are



<P>always a secret, till it is found out that every body knows them.



<P>Only let me be told when I may speak out.--I wonder whether Jane has



<P>any suspicion."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on



<P>that point.&nbsp; He told her the news.&nbsp; Was not she like a daughter,



<P>his eldest daughter?--he must tell her; and Miss Bates being present,



<P>it passed, of course, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton,



<P>immediately afterwards.&nbsp; It was no more than the principals were



<P>prepared for; they had calculated from the time of its being known



<P>at Randalls, how soon it would be over Highbury; and were thinking



<P>of themselves, as the evening wonder in many a family circle,



<P>with great sagacity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In general, it was a very well approved match.&nbsp; Some might think

him,



<P>and others might think her, the most in luck.&nbsp; One set might



<P>recommend their all removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield



<P>for the John Knightleys; and another might predict disagreements



<P>among their servants; but yet, upon the whole, there was no serious



<P>objection raised, except in one habitation, the Vicarage.--There,



<P>the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction.&nbsp; Mr. Elton



<P>cared little about it, compared with his wife; he only hoped "the



<P>young lady's pride would now be contented;" and supposed "she had



<P>always meant to catch Knightley if she could;" and, on the point



<P>of living at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim, "Rather he than I!"--



<P>But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.--"Poor Knightley!



<P>poor fellow!--sad business for him.--She was extremely concerned;



<P>for, though very eccentric, he had a thousand good qualities.--



<P>How could he be so taken in?--Did not think him at all in love--



<P>not in the least.--Poor Knightley!--There would be an end of all



<P>pleasant intercourse with him.--How happy he had been to come and dine



<P>with them whenever they asked him!&nbsp; But that would be all over

now.--



<P>Poor fellow!--No more exploring parties to Donwell made for her.



<P>Oh! no; there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on



<P>every thing.--Extremely disagreeable!&nbsp; But she was not at all sorry



<P>that she had abused the housekeeper the other day.--Shocking plan,



<P>living together.&nbsp; It would never do.&nbsp; She knew a family near

Maple



<P>Grove who had tried it, and been obliged to separate before the end



<P>of the first quarter.

<P><B>CHAPTER I</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the



<P>nature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill.



<P>She was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at



<P>all apprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him.&nbsp; Her own attachment



<P>had really subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of;--



<P>but if he, who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love



<P>of the two, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment



<P>which he had taken away, it would be very distressing.&nbsp; If a separation



<P>of two months should not have cooled him, there were dangers and evils



<P>before her:--caution for him and for herself would be necessary.



<P>She did not mean to have her own affections entangled again,



<P>and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration.



<P>That would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance!



<P>and yet, she could not help rather anticipating something decisive.



<P>She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis,



<P>an event, a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen,



<P>before she had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill's



<P>feelings.&nbsp; The Enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as

had



<P>been imagined, but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards.&nbsp; He

rode



<P>down for a couple of hours; he could not yet do more; but as he came



<P>from Randalls immediately to Hartfield, she could then exercise all



<P>her quick observation, and speedily determine how he was influenced,



<P>and how she must act.&nbsp; They met with the utmost friendliness.



<P>There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her.



<P>But she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he



<P>had done, of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree.



<P>She watched him well.&nbsp; It was a clear thing he was less in love

than he



<P>had been.&nbsp; Absence, with the conviction probably of her indifference,



<P>had produced this very natural and very desirable effect.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemed



<P>delighted to speak of his former visit, and recur to old stories:



<P>and he was not without agitation.&nbsp; It was not in his calmness that



<P>she read his comparative difference.&nbsp; He was not calm; his spirits



<P>were evidently fluttered; there was restlessness about him.



<P>Lively as he was, it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself;



<P>but what decided her belief on the subject, was his staying only a



<P>quarter of an hour, and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury.



<P>"He had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed--



<P>he had not stopped, he would not stop for more than a word--but he



<P>had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call,



<P>and much as he wished to stay longer at Hartfield, he must hurry off."



<P>She had no doubt as to his being less in love--but neither his



<P>agitated spirits, nor his hurrying away, seemed like a perfect cure;



<P>and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her



<P>returning power, and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself



<P>with her long.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days.



<P>He was often hoping, intending to come--but was always prevented.



<P>His aunt could not bear to have him leave her.&nbsp; Such was his own

account



<P>at Randall's. If he were quite sincere, if he really tried to come,



<P>it was to be inferred that Mrs. Churchill's removal to London had



<P>been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder.



<P>That she was really ill was very certain; he had declared himself



<P>convinced of it, at Randalls.&nbsp; Though much might be fancy, he could



<P>not doubt, when he looked back, that she was in a weaker state



<P>of health than she had been half a year ago.&nbsp; He did not believe

it



<P>to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove,



<P>or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her;



<P>but he could not be prevailed on, by all his father's doubts, to say



<P>that her complaints were merely imaginary, or that she was as strong



<P>as ever.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It soon appeared that London was not the place for her.&nbsp; She could



<P>not endure its noise.&nbsp; Her nerves were under continual irritation



<P>and suffering; and by the ten days' end, her nephew's letter to



<P>Randalls communicated a change of plan.&nbsp; They were going to remove



<P>immediately to Richmond.&nbsp; Mrs. Churchill had been recommended



<P>to the medical skill of an eminent person there, and had otherwise



<P>a fancy for the place.&nbsp; A ready-furnished house in a favourite



<P>spot was engaged, and much benefit expected from the change.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement,



<P>and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two



<P>months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends--



<P>for the house was taken for May and June.&nbsp; She was told that now



<P>he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them,



<P>almost as often as he could even wish.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects.&nbsp; He

was



<P>considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered.



<P>She hoped it was not so.&nbsp; Two months must bring it to the proof.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Weston's own happiness was indisputable.&nbsp; He was quite delighted.



<P>It was the very circumstance he could have wished for.&nbsp; Now, it

would



<P>be really having Frank in their neighbourhood.&nbsp; What were nine

miles



<P>to a young man?--An hour's ride.&nbsp; He would be always coming over.



<P>The difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough



<P>to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing



<P>him never.&nbsp; Sixteen miles--nay, eighteen--it must be full eighteen



<P>to Manchester-street--was a serious obstacle.&nbsp; Were he ever able



<P>to get away, the day would be spent in coming and returning.



<P>There was no comfort in having him in London; he might as well be



<P>at Enscombe; but Richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse.



<P>Better than nearer!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal,--



<P>the ball at the Crown.&nbsp; It had not been forgotten before, but it

had



<P>been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day.&nbsp; Now, however,



<P>it was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, and very soon



<P>after the Churchills had removed to Richmond, a few lines from Frank,



<P>to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change,



<P>and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty-four



<P>hours at any given time, induced them to name as early a day as possible.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Weston's ball was to be a real thing.&nbsp; A very few to-morrows



<P>stood between the young people of Highbury and happiness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Woodhouse was resigned.&nbsp; The time of year lightened the evil



<P>to him.&nbsp; May was better for every thing than February.&nbsp; Mrs.

Bates



<P>was engaged to spend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice,



<P>and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear



<P>little John would have any thing the matter with them, while dear



<P>Emma were gone.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>This letter must make its way to Emma's feelings.&nbsp; She was obliged,



<P>in spite of her previous determination to the contrary, to do



<P>it all the justice that Mrs. Weston foretold.&nbsp; As soon as she



<P>came to her own name, it was irresistible; every line relating



<P>to herself was interesting, and almost every line agreeable;



<P>and when this charm ceased, the subject could still maintain itself,



<P>by the natural return of her former regard for the writer, and the



<P>very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at



<P>that moment.&nbsp; She never stopt till she had gone through the whole;



<P>and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong,



<P>yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed--and he had suffered,



<P>and was very sorry--and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston,



<P>and so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she was so happy herself,



<P>that there was no being severe; and could he have entered the room,



<P>she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley came again,



<P>she desired him to read it.&nbsp; She was sure of Mrs. Weston's wishing



<P>it to be communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley,



<P>had seen so much to blame in his conduct.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall be very glad to look it over," said he; "but it seems long.



<P>I will take it home with me at night."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But that would not do.&nbsp; Mr. Weston was to call in the evening,



<P>and she must return it by him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I would rather be talking to you," he replied; "but as it seems



<P>a matter of justice, it shall be done."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He began--stopping, however, almost directly to say, "Had I been offered



<P>the sight of one of this gentleman's letters to his mother-in-law a

few



<P>months ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such indifference."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then,



<P>with a smile, observed, "Humph! a fine complimentary opening:



<P>But it is his way.&nbsp; One man's style must not be the rule of another's.



<P>We will not be severe."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It will be natural for me," he added shortly afterwards, "to speak

my



<P>opinion aloud as I read.&nbsp; By doing it, I shall feel that I am near

you.



<P>It will not be so great a loss of time:&nbsp; but if you dislike it--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not at all.&nbsp; I should wish it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Knightley returned to his reading with greater alacrity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He trifles here," said he, "as to the temptation.&nbsp; He knows



<P>he is wrong, and has nothing rational to urge.--Bad.--He ought



<P>not to have formed the engagement.--`His father's disposition:'--



<P>he is unjust, however, to his father.&nbsp; Mr. Weston's sanguine



<P>temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions;



<P>but Mr. Weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured



<P>to gain it.--Very true; he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And I have not forgotten," said Emma, "how sure you were that he



<P>might have come sooner if he would.&nbsp; You pass it over very handsomely--



<P>but you were perfectly right."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:--but yet, I think--



<P>had you not been in the case--I should still have distrusted him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When he came to Miss Woodhouse, he was obliged to read the whole



<P>of it aloud--all that related to her, with a smile; a look;



<P>a shake of the head; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation;



<P>or merely of love, as the subject required; concluding, however,



<P>seriously, and, after steady reflection, thus--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very bad--though it might have been worse.--Playing a most



<P>dangerous game.&nbsp; Too much indebted to the event for his acquittal.--



<P>No judge of his own manners by you.--Always deceived in fact by his



<P>own wishes, and regardless of little besides his own convenience.--



<P>Fancying you to have fathomed his secret.&nbsp; Natural enough!--



<P>his own mind full of intrigue, that he should suspect it



<P>in others.--Mystery; Finesse--how they pervert the understanding!



<P>My Emma, does not every thing serve to prove more and more the



<P>beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet's account,



<P>which she could not give any sincere explanation of.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You had better go on," said she.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He did so, but very soon stopt again to say, "the pianoforte!



<P>Ah!&nbsp; That was the act of a very, very young man, one too young



<P>to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much



<P>exceed the pleasure.&nbsp; A boyish scheme, indeed!--I cannot



<P>comprehend a man's wishing to give a woman any proof of affection



<P>which he knows she would rather dispense with; and he did



<P>know that she would have prevented the instrument's coming if she could."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After this, he made some progress without any pause.



<P>Frank Churchill's confession of having behaved shamefully



<P>was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I perfectly agree with you, sir,"--was then his remark.



<P>"You did behave very shamefully.&nbsp; You never wrote a truer line."



<P>And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis



<P>of their disagreement, and his persisting to act in direct



<P>opposition to Jane Fairfax's sense of right, he made a fuller pause



<P>to say, "This is very bad.--He had induced her to place herself,



<P>for his sake, in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness,



<P>and it should have been his first object to prevent her from



<P>suffering unnecessarily.--She must have had much more to contend with,



<P>in carrying on the correspondence, than he could.&nbsp; He should have



<P>respected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such; but hers



<P>were all reasonable.&nbsp; We must look to her one fault, and remember



<P>that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement,



<P>to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party,



<P>and grew uncomfortable.&nbsp; Her own behaviour had been so very improper!



<P>She was deeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his next look.



<P>It was all read, however, steadily, attentively, and without



<P>the smallest remark; and, excepting one momentary glance at her,



<P>instantly withdrawn, in the fear of giving pain--no remembrance



<P>of Box Hill seemed to exist.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends,



<P>the Eltons," was his next observation.--"His feelings are natural.--



<P>What! actually resolve to break with him entirely!--She felt



<P>the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each--



<P>she dissolved it.--What a view this gives of her sense of



<P>his behaviour!--Well, he must be a most extraordinary--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nay, nay, read on.--You will find how very much he suffers."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hope he does," replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming the letter.



<P>"`Smallridge!'--What does this mean?&nbsp; What is all this?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge's children--



<P>a dear friend of Mrs. Elton's--a neighbour of Maple Grove; and,



<P>by the bye, I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Say nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to read--not even



<P>of Mrs. Elton.&nbsp; Only one page more.&nbsp; I shall soon have done.



<P>What a letter the man writes!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, there is feeling here.--He does seem to have suffered in finding



<P>her ill.--Certainly, I can have no doubt of his being fond of her.



<P>`Dearer, much dearer than ever.'&nbsp; I hope he may long continue to

feel



<P>all the value of such a reconciliation.--He is a very liberal thanker,



<P>with his thousands and tens of thousands.--`Happier than I deserve.'



<P>Come, he knows himself there.&nbsp; `Miss Woodhouse calls me the child



<P>of good fortune.'--Those were Miss Woodhouse's words, were they?--



<P>And a fine ending--and there is the letter.&nbsp; The child of good

fortune!



<P>That was your name for him, was it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am;



<P>but still you must, at least I hope you must, think the better



<P>of him for it.&nbsp; I hope it does him some service with you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, certainly it does.&nbsp; He has had great faults, faults of



<P>inconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his



<P>opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves:



<P>but still as he is, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax,



<P>and will soon, it may be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly



<P>with her, I am very ready to believe his character will improve,



<P>and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle



<P>that it wants.&nbsp; And now, let me talk to you of something else.



<P>I have another person's interest at present so much at heart,



<P>that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill.&nbsp; Ever since

I



<P>left you this morning, Emma, my mind has been hard at work on



<P>one subject."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike English,



<P>such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with,



<P>how to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking the



<P>happiness of her father.&nbsp; Emma's answer was ready at the first

word.



<P>"While her dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossible



<P>for her.&nbsp; She could never quit him."&nbsp; Part only of this answer,



<P>however, was admitted.&nbsp; The impossibility of her quitting her father,



<P>Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but the inadmissibility



<P>of any other change, he could not agree to.&nbsp; He had been thinking



<P>it over most deeply, most intently; he had at first hoped to induce



<P>Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell; he had wanted to believe



<P>it feasible, but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer



<P>him to deceive himself long; and now he confessed his persuasion,



<P>that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father's comfort,



<P>perhaps even of his life, which must not be hazarded.&nbsp; Mr. Woodhouse



<P>taken from Hartfield!--No, he felt that it ought not to be attempted.



<P>But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this, he trusted



<P>his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable;



<P>it was, that he should be received at Hartfield; that so long as



<P>her father's happiness in other words his life--required Hartfield



<P>to continue her home, it should be his likewise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Of their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her own



<P>passing thoughts.&nbsp; Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected

it;



<P>but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her.



<P>She was sensible of all the affection it evinced.&nbsp; She felt that,



<P>in quitting Donwell, he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence



<P>of hours and habits; that in living constantly with her father,



<P>and in no house of his own, there would be much, very much,



<P>to be borne with.&nbsp; She promised to think of it, and advised him



<P>to think of it more; but he was fully convinced, that no reflection



<P>could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject.&nbsp; He had



<P>given it, he could assure her, very long and calm consideration;



<P>he had been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning,



<P>to have his thoughts to himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for," cried Emma.&nbsp; "I am



<P>sure William Larkins will not like it.&nbsp; You must get his consent



<P>before you ask mine."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised, moreover,



<P>to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good scheme.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of view



<P>in which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was never



<P>struck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry, whose rights



<P>as heir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded.



<P>Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy;



<P>and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it,



<P>and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent



<P>dislike of Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else,



<P>which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of



<P>the sister and the aunt.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This proposal of his, this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield--



<P>the more she contemplated it, the more pleasing it became.



<P>His evils seemed to lessen, her own advantages to increase,



<P>their mutual good to outweigh every drawback.&nbsp; Such a companion



<P>for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her!--



<P>Such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be



<P>giving increase of melancholy!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every



<P>blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings



<P>of her friend, who must now be even excluded from Hartfield.



<P>The delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself,



<P>poor Harriet must, in mere charitable caution, be kept at a



<P>distance from.&nbsp; She would be a loser in every way.&nbsp; Emma could

not



<P>deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment.



<P>In such a party, Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise;



<P>but for the poor girl herself, it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity



<P>that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is,



<P>supplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early.



<P>Mr. Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;--



<P>not like Mr. Elton.&nbsp; Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling,



<P>so truly considerate for every body, would never deserve to be



<P>less worshipped than now; and it really was too much to hope even



<P>of Harriet, that she could be in love with more than three men



<P>in one year.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house



<P>from what she had brought out!--she had then been only daring to hope



<P>for a little respite of suffering;--she was now in an exquisite



<P>flutter of happiness, and such happiness moreover as she believed



<P>must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They sat down to tea--the same party round the same table--



<P>how often it had been collected!--and how often had her eyes fallen



<P>on the same shrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful



<P>effect of the western sun!--But never in such a state of spirits,



<P>never in any thing like it; and it was with difficulty that she could



<P>summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house,



<P>or even the attentive daughter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Poor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him



<P>in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming, and so



<P>anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride.--Could he



<P>have seen the heart, he would have cared very little for the lungs;



<P>but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil,



<P>without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in



<P>the looks or ways of either, he repeated to them very comfortably



<P>all the articles of news he had received from Mr. Perry, and talked



<P>on with much self-contentment, totally unsuspicious of what they



<P>could have told him in return.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma's fever continued;



<P>but when he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised



<P>and subdued--and in the course of the sleepless night, which was



<P>the tax for such an evening, she found one or two such very serious



<P>points to consider, as made her feel, that even her happiness



<P>must have some alloy.&nbsp; Her father--and Harriet.&nbsp; She could

not be



<P>alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims;



<P>and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost, was the question.



<P>With respect to her father, it was a question soon answered.



<P>She hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley would ask; but a very short



<P>parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution



<P>of never quitting her father.--She even wept over the idea of it,



<P>as a sin of thought.&nbsp; While he lived, it must be only an engagement;



<P>but she flattered herself, that if divested of the danger of



<P>drawing her away, it might become an increase of comfort to him.--



<P>How to do her best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;--



<P>how to spare her from any unnecessary pain; how to make



<P>her any possible atonement; how to appear least her enemy?--



<P>On these subjects, her perplexity and distress were very great--



<P>and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter



<P>reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it.--



<P>She could only resolve at last, that she would still avoid a



<P>meeting with her, and communicate all that need be told by letter;



<P>that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just



<P>now for a time from Highbury, and--indulging in one scheme more--



<P>nearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get an invitation



<P>for her to Brunswick Square.--Isabella had been pleased with Harriet;



<P>and a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement.--



<P>She did not think it in Harriet's nature to escape being benefited



<P>by novelty and variety, by the streets, the shops, and the children.--



<P>At any rate, it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself,



<P>from whom every thing was due; a separation for the present; an averting



<P>of the evil day, when they must all be together again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She rose early, and wrote her letter to Harriet; an employment



<P>which left her so very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley,



<P>in walking up to Hartfield to breakfast, did not arrive at all too soon;



<P>and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again



<P>with him, literally and figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate



<P>her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had not left her long, by no means long enough for her to have



<P>the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a letter



<P>was brought her from Randalls--a very thick letter;--she guessed



<P>what it must contain, and deprecated the necessity of reading it.--



<P>She was now in perfect charity with Frank Churchill; she wanted



<P>no explanations, she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself--



<P>and as for understanding any thing he wrote, she was sure she was



<P>incapable of it.--It must be waded through, however.&nbsp; She opened



<P>the packet; it was too surely so;--a note from Mrs. Weston to herself,



<P>ushered in the letter from Frank to Mrs. Weston.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have the greatest pleasure, my dear Emma, in forwarding



<P>to you the enclosed.&nbsp; I know what thorough justice you will



<P>do it, and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect.--I think



<P>we shall never materially disagree about the writer again;



<P>but I will not delay you by a long preface.--We are quite well.--



<P>This letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness I have



<P>been feeling lately.--I did not quite like your looks on Tuesday,



<P>but it was an ungenial morning; and though you will never own being



<P>affected by weather, I think every body feels a north-east wind.--



<P>I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesday



<P>afternoon and yesterday morning, but had the comfort of hearing



<P>last night, by Mr. Perry, that it had not made him ill.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

"Yours ever,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

[To Mrs. Weston.]



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

WINDSOR-JULY.



<P>MY DEAR MADAM,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If I made myself intelligible yesterday, this letter will be expected;



<P>but expected or not, I know it will be read with candour and indulgence.--



<P>You are all goodness, and I believe there will be need of even



<P>all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct.--



<P>But I have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent.



<P>My courage rises while I write.&nbsp; It is very difficult for the



<P>prosperous to be humble.&nbsp; I have already met with such success



<P>in two applications for pardon, that I may be in danger of thinking



<P>myself too sure of yours, and of those among your friends who have



<P>had any ground of offence.--You must all endeavour to comprehend



<P>the exact nature of my situation when I first arrived at Randalls;



<P>you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept



<P>at all hazards.&nbsp; This was the fact.&nbsp; My right to place myself



<P>in a situation requiring such concealment, is another question.



<P>I shall not discuss it here.&nbsp; For my temptation to think it a right,



<P>I refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows below,



<P>and casements above, in Highbury.&nbsp; I dared not address her openly;



<P>my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well



<P>known to require definition; and I was fortunate enough to prevail,



<P>before we parted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upright female



<P>mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.--



<P>Had she refused, I should have gone mad.--But you will be ready to say,



<P>what was your hope in doing this?--What did you look forward to?--



<P>To any thing, every thing--to time, chance, circumstance, slow effects,



<P>sudden bursts, perseverance and weariness, health and sickness.



<P>Every possibility of good was before me, and the first of blessings



<P>secured, in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence.



<P>If you need farther explanation, I have the honour, my dear madam,



<P>of being your husband's son, and the advantage of inheriting



<P>a disposition to hope for good, which no inheritance of houses



<P>or lands can ever equal the value of.--See me, then, under these



<P>circumstances, arriving on my first visit to Randalls;--and here I



<P>am conscious of wrong, for that visit might have been sooner paid.



<P>You will look back and see that I did not come till Miss Fairfax



<P>was in Highbury; and as you were the person slighted, you will



<P>forgive me instantly; but I must work on my father's compassion,



<P>by reminding him, that so long as I absented myself from his house,



<P>so long I lost the blessing of knowing you.&nbsp; My behaviour,



<P>during the very happy fortnight which I spent with you, did not,



<P>I hope, lay me open to reprehension, excepting on one point.



<P>And now I come to the principal, the only important part of my



<P>conduct while belonging to you, which excites my own anxiety,



<P>or requires very solicitous explanation.&nbsp; With the greatest respect,



<P>and the warmest friendship, do I mention Miss Woodhouse; my father



<P>perhaps will think I ought to add, with the deepest humiliation.--



<P>A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion,



<P>and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.--My behaviour



<P>to Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe, more than it ought.--



<P>In order to assist a concealment so essential to me, I was led



<P>on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy



<P>into which we were immediately thrown.--I cannot deny that Miss



<P>Woodhouse was my ostensible object--but I am sure you will believe



<P>the declaration, that had I not been convinced of her indifference,



<P>I would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on.--



<P>Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is, she never gave me



<P>the idea of a young woman likely to be attached; and that she was



<P>perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me, was as much



<P>my conviction as my wish.--She received my attentions with an easy,



<P>friendly, goodhumoured playfulness, which exactly suited me.



<P>We seemed to understand each other.&nbsp; From our relative situation,



<P>those attentions were her due, and were felt to be so.--Whether Miss



<P>Woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of



<P>that fortnight, I cannot say;--when I called to take leave of her,



<P>I remember that I was within a moment of confessing the truth,



<P>and I then fancied she was not without suspicion; but I have no



<P>doubt of her having since detected me, at least in some degree.--



<P>She may not have surmised the whole, but her quickness must



<P>have penetrated a part.&nbsp; I cannot doubt it.&nbsp; You will find,



<P>whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints,



<P>that it did not take her wholly by surprize.&nbsp; She frequently gave



<P>me hints of it.&nbsp; I remember her telling me at the ball, that I



<P>owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her attentions to Miss Fairfax.--



<P>I hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted



<P>by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss.



<P>While you considered me as having sinned against Emma Woodhouse,



<P>I could deserve nothing from either.&nbsp; Acquit me here, and procure



<P>for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes of that



<P>said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly affection,



<P>as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself.--



<P>Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight, you have



<P>now a key to.&nbsp; My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to

get



<P>my body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion.



<P>If you remember any queernesses, set them all to the right account.--



<P>Of the pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say,



<P>that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F--, who would



<P>never have allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her.--



<P>The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement,



<P>my dear madam, is much beyond my power of doing justice to.



<P>You will soon, I earnestly hope, know her thoroughly yourself.--



<P>No description can describe her.&nbsp; She must tell you herself what

she is--



<P>yet not by word, for never was there a human creature who would



<P>so designedly suppress her own merit.--Since I began this letter,



<P>which will be longer than I foresaw, I have heard from her.--



<P>She gives a good account of her own health; but as she never complains,



<P>I dare not depend.&nbsp; I want to have your opinion of her looks.



<P>I know you will soon call on her; she is living in dread of the visit.



<P>Perhaps it is paid already.&nbsp; Let me hear from you without delay;



<P>I am impatient for a thousand particulars.&nbsp; Remember how few



<P>minutes I was at Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state:



<P>and I am not much better yet; still insane either from happiness



<P>or misery.&nbsp; When I think of the kindness and favour I have met

with,



<P>of her excellence and patience, and my uncle's generosity, I am mad



<P>with joy:&nbsp; but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned

her,



<P>and how little I deserve to be forgiven, I am mad with anger.



<P>If I could but see her again!--But I must not propose it yet.



<P>My uncle has been too good for me to encroach.--I must still add



<P>to this long letter.&nbsp; You have not heard all that you ought to

hear.



<P>I could not give any connected detail yesterday; but the suddenness,



<P>and, in one light, the unseasonableness with which the affair burst

out,



<P>needs explanation; for though the event of the 26th ult., as you



<P>will conclude, immediately opened to me the happiest prospects,



<P>I should not have presumed on such early measures, but from the



<P>very particular circumstances, which left me not an hour to lose.



<P>I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty, and she would have



<P>felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement.--



<P>But I had no choice.&nbsp; The hasty engagement she had entered into

with



<P>that woman--Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to leave off abruptly,



<P>to recollect and compose myself.--I have been walking over the country,



<P>and am now, I hope, rational enough to make the rest of my letter



<P>what it ought to be.--It is, in fact, a most mortifying retrospect



<P>for me.&nbsp; I behaved shamefully.&nbsp; And here I can admit, that

my manners



<P>to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were highly blameable.



<P>She disapproved them, which ought to have been enough.--My plea of



<P>concealing the truth she did not think sufficient.--She was displeased;



<P>I thought unreasonably so:&nbsp; I thought her, on a thousand occasions,



<P>unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious:&nbsp; I thought her even cold.



<P>But she was always right.&nbsp; If I had followed her judgment, and

subdued



<P>my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper, I should have



<P>escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.--We quarrelled.--



<P>Do you remember the morning spent at Donwell?--There every little



<P>dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis.&nbsp; I was

late;



<P>I met her walking home by herself, and wanted to walk with her,



<P>but she would not suffer it.&nbsp; She absolutely refused to allow me,



<P>which I then thought most unreasonable.&nbsp; Now, however, I see nothing



<P>in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion.



<P>While I, to blind the world to our engagement, was behaving one



<P>hour with objectionable particularity to another woman, was she



<P>to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made



<P>every previous caution useless?--Had we been met walking together



<P>between Donwell and Highbury, the truth must have been suspected.--



<P>I was mad enough, however, to resent.--I doubted her affection.



<P>I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when, provoked by



<P>such conduct on my side, such shameful, insolent neglect of her,



<P>and such apparent devotion to Miss W., as it would have been



<P>impossible for any woman of sense to endure, she spoke her



<P>resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me.--



<P>In short, my dear madam, it was a quarrel blameless on her side,



<P>abominable on mine; and I returned the same evening to Richmond,



<P>though I might have staid with you till the next morning,



<P>merely because I would be as angry with her as possible.&nbsp; Even

then,



<P>I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time;



<P>but I was the injured person, injured by her coldness, and I went



<P>away determined that she should make the first advances.--I shall



<P>always congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party.



<P>Had you witnessed my behaviour there, I can hardly suppose you would



<P>ever have thought well of me again.&nbsp; Its effect upon her appears



<P>in the immediate resolution it produced:&nbsp; as soon as she found

I



<P>was really gone from Randalls, she closed with the offer of that



<P>officious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her,



<P>by the bye, has ever filled me with indignation and hatred.



<P>I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been



<P>so richly extended towards myself; but, otherwise, I should loudly



<P>protest against the share of it which that woman has known.--



<P>"Jane," indeed!--You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself



<P>in calling her by that name, even to you.&nbsp; Think, then, what I

must



<P>have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all



<P>the vulgarity of needless repetition, and all the insolence of



<P>imaginary superiority.&nbsp; Have patience with me, I shall soon have

done.--



<P>She closed with this offer, resolving to break with me entirely,



<P>and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again.--



<P>She felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery



<P>to each:&nbsp; she dissolved it.--This letter reached me on the very



<P>morning of my poor aunt's death.&nbsp; I answered it within an hour;



<P>but from the confusion of my mind, and the multiplicity of business



<P>falling on me at once, my answer, instead of being sent with all



<P>the many other letters of that day, was locked up in my writing-desk;



<P>and I, trusting that I had written enough, though but a few lines,



<P>to satisfy her, remained without any uneasiness.--I was rather



<P>disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily;



<P>but I made excuses for her, and was too busy, and--may I add?--



<P>too cheerful in my views to be captious.--We removed to Windsor;



<P>and two days afterwards I received a parcel from her, my own letters



<P>all returned!--and a few lines at the same time by the post,



<P>stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply



<P>to her last; and adding, that as silence on such a point could



<P>not be misconstrued, and as it must be equally desirable to both



<P>to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible,



<P>she now sent me, by a safe conveyance, all my letters, and requested,



<P>that if I could not directly command hers, so as to send them



<P>to Highbury within a week, I would forward them after that period



<P>to her at--:&nbsp; in short, the full direction to Mr. Smallridge's,



<P>near Bristol, stared me in the face.&nbsp; I knew the name, the place,



<P>I knew all about it, and instantly saw what she had been doing.



<P>It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character



<P>which I knew her to possess; and the secrecy she had maintained,



<P>as to any such design in her former letter, was equally descriptive



<P>of its anxious delicacy.&nbsp; For the world would not she have seemed



<P>to threaten me.--Imagine the shock; imagine how, till I had actually



<P>detected my own blunder, I raved at the blunders of the post.--



<P>What was to be done?--One thing only.--I must speak to my uncle.



<P>Without his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again.--



<P>I spoke; circumstances were in my favour; the late event had softened



<P>away his pride, and he was, earlier than I could have anticipated,



<P>wholly reconciled and complying; and could say at last, poor man!



<P>with a deep sigh, that he wished I might find as much happiness



<P>in the marriage state as he had done.--I felt that it would be



<P>of a different sort.--Are you disposed to pity me for what I must



<P>have suffered in opening the cause to him, for my suspense while



<P>all was at stake?--No; do not pity me till I reached Highbury,



<P>and saw how ill I had made her.&nbsp; Do not pity me till I saw her

wan,



<P>sick looks.--I reached Highbury at the time of day when, from my



<P>knowledge of their late breakfast hour, I was certain of a good chance



<P>of finding her alone.--I was not disappointed; and at last I was



<P>not disappointed either in the object of my journey.&nbsp; A great deal



<P>of very reasonable, very just displeasure I had to persuade away.



<P>But it is done; we are reconciled, dearer, much dearer, than ever,



<P>and no moment's uneasiness can ever occur between us again.&nbsp; Now,

my



<P>dear madam, I will release you; but I could not conclude before.



<P>A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have



<P>ever shewn me, and ten thousand for the attentions your heart



<P>will dictate towards her.--If you think me in a way to be happier



<P>than I deserve, I am quite of your opinion.--Miss W. calls me



<P>the child of good fortune.&nbsp; I hope she is right.--In one respect,



<P>my good fortune is undoubted, that of being able to subscribe



<P>myself,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Your obliged and affectionate Son,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>A very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came



<P>one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after



<P>sitting down and hesitating, thus began:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Miss Woodhouse--if you are at leisure--I have something that I



<P>should like to tell you--a sort of confession to make--and then,



<P>you know, it will be over."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak.



<P>There was a seriousness in Harriet's manner which prepared her,



<P>quite as much as her words, for something more than ordinary.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish," she continued,



<P>"to have no reserves with you on this subject.&nbsp; As I am happily



<P>quite an altered creature in one respect, it is very fit that you



<P>should have the satisfaction of knowing it.&nbsp; I do not want to say



<P>more than is necessary--I am too much ashamed of having given way



<P>as I have done, and I dare say you understand me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," said Emma, "I hope I do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How I could so long a time be fancying myself! . . ."



<P>cried Harriet, warmly.&nbsp; "It seems like madness!&nbsp; I can see

nothing



<P>at all extraordinary in him now.--I do not care whether I meet



<P>him or not--except that of the two I had rather not see him--



<P>and indeed I would go any distance round to avoid him--but I do



<P>not envy his wife in the least; I neither admire her nor envy her,



<P>as I have done:&nbsp; she is very charming, I dare say, and all that,



<P>but I think her very ill-tempered and disagreeable--I shall never forget



<P>her look the other night!--However, I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,



<P>I wish her no evil.--No, let them be ever so happy together,



<P>it will not give me another moment's pang:&nbsp; and to convince you



<P>that I have been speaking truth, I am now going to destroy--what I



<P>ought to have destroyed long ago--what I ought never to have kept--



<P>I know that very well (blushing as she spoke).--However, now I



<P>will destroy it all--and it is my particular wish to do it



<P>in your presence, that you may see how rational I am grown.



<P>Cannot you guess what this parcel holds?" said she, with a conscious

look.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not the least in the world.--Did he ever give you any thing?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No--I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have



<P>valued very much."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words Most



<P>precious treasures on the top.&nbsp; Her curiosity was greatly excited.



<P>Harriet unfolded the parcel, and she looked on with impatience.



<P>Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware

box,



<P>which Harriet opened:&nbsp; it was well lined with the softest cotton;



<P>but, excepting the cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now," said Harriet, "you must recollect."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, indeed I do not."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dear me!&nbsp; I should not have thought it possible you could forget



<P>what passed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very



<P>last times we ever met in it!--It was but a very few days before I



<P>had my sore throat--just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came--



<P>I think the very evening.--Do not you remember his cutting his finger



<P>with your new penknife, and your recommending court-plaister?--



<P>But, as you had none about you, and knew I had, you desired



<P>me to supply him; and so I took mine out and cut him a piece;



<P>but it was a great deal too large, and he cut it smaller, and kept



<P>playing some time with what was left, before he gave it back to me.



<P>And so then, in my nonsense, I could not help making a treasure of it--



<P>so I put it by never to be used, and looked at it now and then



<P>as a great treat."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dearest Harriet!" cried Emma, putting her hand before her face,



<P>and jumping up, "you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear.



<P>Remember it?&nbsp; Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving



<P>this relic--I knew nothing of that till this moment--but the cutting



<P>the finger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had none



<P>about me!--Oh! my sins, my sins!--And I had plenty all the while in



<P>my pocket!--One of my senseless tricks!--I deserve to be under a



<P>continual blush all the rest of my life.--Well--(sitting down again)--



<P>go on--what else?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And had you really some at hand yourself?&nbsp; I am sure I never



<P>suspected it, you did it so naturally."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake!"



<P>said Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided



<P>between wonder and amusement.&nbsp; And secretly she added to herself,



<P>"Lord bless me! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton



<P>a piece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about!



<P>I never was equal to this."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here," resumed Harriet, turning to her box again, "here is



<P>something still more valuable, I mean that has been more valuable,



<P>because this is what did really once belong to him, which the



<P>court-plaister never did."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure.&nbsp; It was the

end



<P>of an old pencil,--the part without any lead.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This was really his," said Harriet.--"Do not you remember



<P>one morning?--no, I dare say you do not.&nbsp; But one morning--I forget



<P>exactly the day--but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before



<P>that evening, he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket-book;



<P>it was about spruce-beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling him



<P>something about brewing spruce-beer, and he wanted to put it down;



<P>but when he took out his pencil, there was so little lead that he



<P>soon cut it all away, and it would not do, so you lent him another,



<P>and this was left upon the table as good for nothing.&nbsp; But I kept



<P>my eye on it; and, as soon as I dared, caught it up, and never



<P>parted with it again from that moment."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do remember it," cried Emma; "I perfectly remember it.--



<P>Talking about spruce-beer.--Oh! yes--Mr. Knightley and I both saying

we



<P>liked it, and Mr. Elton's seeming resolved to learn to like it too.



<P>I perfectly remember it.--Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here,



<P>was not he?&nbsp; I have an idea he was standing just here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah!&nbsp; I do not know.&nbsp; I cannot recollect.--It is very odd,



<P>but I cannot recollect.--Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember,



<P>much about where I am now."--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, go on."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! that's all.&nbsp; I have nothing more to shew you, or to say--



<P>except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire,



<P>and I wish you to see me do it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness



<P>in treasuring up these things?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, simpleton as I was!--but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish



<P>I could forget as easily as I can burn them.&nbsp; It was very wrong



<P>of me, you know, to keep any remembrances, after he was married.



<P>I knew it was--but had not resolution enough to part with them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?--I have



<P>not a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister



<P>might be useful."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall be happier to burn it," replied Harriet.&nbsp; "It has



<P>a disagreeable look to me.&nbsp; I must get rid of every thing.--



<P>There it goes, and there is an end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And when," thought Emma, "will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was



<P>already made, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she had



<P>told no fortune, might be proved to have made Harriet's.--About a



<P>fortnight after the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation,



<P>and quite undesignedly.&nbsp; Emma was not thinking of it at the moment,



<P>which made the information she received more valuable.



<P>She merely said, in the course of some trivial chat, "Well, Harriet,



<P>whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so"--and thought



<P>no more of it, till after a minute's silence she heard Harriet



<P>say in a very serious tone, "I shall never marry."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a



<P>moment's debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Never marry!--This is a new resolution."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is one that I shall never change, however."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After another short hesitation, "I hope it does not proceed from--



<P>I hope it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr. Elton indeed!" cried Harriet indignantly.--"Oh! no"--and Emma



<P>could just catch the words, "so superior to Mr. Elton!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She then took a longer time for consideration.&nbsp; Should she proceed



<P>no farther?--should she let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing?--



<P>Perhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did;



<P>or perhaps if she were totally silent, it might only drive



<P>Harriet into asking her to hear too much; and against any thing



<P>like such an unreserve as had been, such an open and frequent



<P>discussion of hopes and chances, she was perfectly resolved.--



<P>She believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once,



<P>all that she meant to say and know.&nbsp; Plain dealing was always best.



<P>She had previously determined how far she would proceed,



<P>on any application of the sort; and it would be safer for both,



<P>to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.--



<P>She was decided, and thus spoke--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning.



<P>Your resolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying,



<P>results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer,



<P>would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you.



<P>Is not it so?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh!&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to

suppose--



<P>Indeed I am not so mad.--But it is a pleasure to me to admire him



<P>at a distance--and to think of his infinite superiority to all



<P>the rest of the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration,



<P>which are so proper, in me especially."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet.&nbsp; The service he rendered



<P>you was enough to warm your heart."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation!--



<P>The very recollection of it, and all that I felt at the time--



<P>when I saw him coming--his noble look--and my wretchedness before.



<P>Such a change!&nbsp; In one moment such a change!&nbsp; From perfect

misery



<P>to perfect happiness!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is very natural.&nbsp; It is natural, and it is honourable.--



<P>Yes, honourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.--



<P>But that it will be a fortunate preference is more that I can promise.



<P>I do not advise you to give way to it, Harriet.&nbsp; I do not by any



<P>means engage for its being returned.&nbsp; Consider what you are about.



<P>Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can:



<P>at any rate do not let them carry you far, unless you are persuaded



<P>of his liking you.&nbsp; Be observant of him.&nbsp; Let his behaviour

be the



<P>guide of your sensations.&nbsp; I give you this caution now, because

I



<P>shall never speak to you again on the subject.&nbsp; I am determined



<P>against all interference.&nbsp; Henceforward I know nothing of the matter.



<P>Let no name ever pass our lips.&nbsp; We were very wrong before;



<P>we will be cautious now.--He is your superior, no doubt, and there



<P>do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature;



<P>but yet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, there have



<P>been matches of greater disparity.&nbsp; But take care of yourself.



<P>I would not have you too sanguine; though, however it may end,



<P>be assured your raising your thoughts to him, is a mark of good taste



<P>which I shall always know how to value."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude.



<P>Emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing



<P>for her friend.&nbsp; Its tendency would be to raise and refine her

mind--



<P>and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>One morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill's decease,



<P>Emma was called downstairs to Mr. Weston, who "could not stay



<P>five minutes, and wanted particularly to speak with her."--



<P>He met her at the parlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did,



<P>in the natural key of his voice, sunk it immediately, to say,



<P>unheard by her father,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?--Do, if it



<P>be possible.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston wants to see you.&nbsp; She must see

you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Is she unwell?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, no, not at all--only a little agitated.&nbsp; She would have



<P>ordered the carriage, and come to you, but she must see you alone,



<P>and that you know--(nodding towards her father)--Humph!--Can you come?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Certainly.&nbsp; This moment, if you please.&nbsp; It is impossible

to



<P>refuse what you ask in such a way.&nbsp; But what can be the matter?--



<P>Is she really not ill?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Depend upon me--but ask no more questions.&nbsp; You will know it



<P>all in time.&nbsp; The most unaccountable business!&nbsp; But hush,

hush!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma.



<P>Something really important seemed announced by his looks;



<P>but, as her friend was well, she endeavoured not to be uneasy,



<P>and settling it with her father, that she would take her walk now,



<P>she and Mr. Weston were soon out of the house together and on



<P>their way at a quick pace for Randalls.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now,"--said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,--



<P>"now Mr. Weston, do let me know what has happened."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, no,"--he gravely replied.--"Don't ask me.&nbsp; I promised my wife



<P>to leave it all to her.&nbsp; She will break it to you better than I

can.



<P>Do not be impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Break it to me," cried Emma, standing still with terror.--



<P>"Good God!--Mr. Weston, tell me at once.--Something has happened



<P>in Brunswick Square.&nbsp; I know it has.&nbsp; Tell me, I charge you

tell



<P>me this moment what it is."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, indeed you are mistaken."--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.--Consider how many of my dearest



<P>friends are now in Brunswick Square.&nbsp; Which of them is it?--



<P>I charge you by all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Upon my word, Emma."--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your word!--why not your honour!--why not say upon your honour,



<P>that it has nothing to do with any of them?&nbsp; Good Heavens!--What

can



<P>be to be broke to me, that does not relate to one of that family?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Upon my honour," said he very seriously, "it does not.&nbsp; It is

not



<P>in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name



<P>of Knightley."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma's courage returned, and she walked on.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was wrong," he continued, "in talking of its being broke to you.



<P>I should not have used the expression.&nbsp; In fact, it does not concern

you--



<P>it concerns only myself,--that is, we hope.--Humph!--In short,



<P>my dear Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it.



<P>I don't say that it is not a disagreeable business--but things might



<P>be much worse.--If we walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma found that she must wait; and now it required little effort.



<P>She asked no more questions therefore, merely employed her own fancy,



<P>and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some



<P>money concern--something just come to light, of a disagreeable



<P>nature in the circumstances of the family,--something which the late



<P>event at Richmond had brought forward.&nbsp; Her fancy was very active.



<P>Half a dozen natural children, perhaps--and poor Frank cut off!--



<P>This, though very undesirable, would be no matter of agony to her.



<P>It inspired little more than an animating curiosity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Who is that gentleman on horseback?" said she, as they proceeded--



<P>speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret, than with



<P>any other view.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not know.--One of the Otways.--Not Frank;--it is not Frank,



<P>I assure you.&nbsp; You will not see him.&nbsp; He is half way to Windsor



<P>by this time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Has your son been with you, then?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! yes--did not you know?--Well, well, never mind."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more



<P>guarded and demure,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.--"Well, my dear,"



<P>said he, as they entered the room--"I have brought her, and now



<P>I hope you will soon be better.&nbsp; I shall leave you together.



<P>There is no use in delay.&nbsp; I shall not be far off, if you want

me."--



<P>And Emma distinctly heard him add, in a lower tone, before he



<P>quitted the room,--"I have been as good as my word.&nbsp; She has not

the



<P>least idea."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation,



<P>that Emma's uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone,



<P>she eagerly said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What is it my dear friend?&nbsp; Something of a very unpleasant nature,



<P>I find, has occurred;--do let me know directly what it is.



<P>I have been walking all this way in complete suspense.&nbsp; We both



<P>abhor suspense.&nbsp; Do not let mine continue longer.&nbsp; It will

do you



<P>good to speak of your distress, whatever it may be."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Have you indeed no idea?" said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice.



<P>"Cannot you, my dear Emma--cannot you form a guess as to what you



<P>are to hear?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are right.&nbsp; It does relate to him, and I will tell you directly;"



<P>(resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking up.)



<P>"He has been here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand.



<P>It is impossible to express our surprize.&nbsp; He came to speak to

his



<P>father on a subject,--to announce an attachment--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She stopped to breathe.&nbsp; Emma thought first of herself, and then



<P>of Harriet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"More than an attachment, indeed," resumed Mrs. Weston; "an engagement--



<P>a positive engagement.--What will you say, Emma--what will any



<P>body say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax



<P>are engaged;--nay, that they have been long engaged!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma even jumped with surprize;--and, horror-struck, exclaimed,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Jane Fairfax!--Good God!&nbsp; You are not serious?&nbsp; You do not

mean it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You may well be amazed," returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her eyes,



<P>and talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to recover--



<P>"You may well be amazed.&nbsp; But it is even so.&nbsp; There has been

a solemn



<P>engagement between them ever since October--formed at Weymouth,



<P>and kept a secret from every body.&nbsp; Not a creature knowing it



<P>but themselves--neither the Campbells, nor her family, nor his.--



<P>It is so wonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact,



<P>it is yet almost incredible to myself.&nbsp; I can hardly believe it.--



<P>I thought I knew him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma scarcely heard what was said.--Her mind was divided between



<P>two ideas--her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax;



<P>and poor Harriet;--and for some time she could only exclaim,



<P>and require confirmation, repeated confirmation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well," said she at last, trying to recover herself; "this is a



<P>circumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I



<P>can at all comprehend it.&nbsp; What!--engaged to her all the winter--



<P>before either of them came to Highbury?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Engaged since October,--secretly engaged.--It has hurt me,



<P>Emma, very much.&nbsp; It has hurt his father equally.&nbsp; Some part



<P>of his conduct we cannot excuse."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma pondered a moment, and then replied, "I will not pretend



<P>not to understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power,



<P>be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me,



<P>as you are apprehensive of."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma's countenance



<P>was as steady as her words.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my



<P>present perfect indifference," she continued, "I will farther tell you,



<P>that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance,



<P>when I did like him, when I was very much disposed to be



<P>attached to him--nay, was attached--and how it came to cease,



<P>is perhaps the wonder.&nbsp; Fortunately, however, it did cease.



<P>I have really for some time past, for at least these three months,



<P>cared nothing about him.&nbsp; You may believe me, Mrs. Weston.



<P>This is the simple truth."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could



<P>find utterance, assured her, that this protestation had done



<P>her more good than any thing else in the world could do.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself," said she.



<P>"On this point we have been wretched.&nbsp; It was our darling wish

that you



<P>might be attached to each other--and we were persuaded that it was so.--



<P>Imagine what we have been feeling on your account."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of



<P>grateful wonder to you and myself.&nbsp; But this does not acquit him,



<P>Mrs. Weston; and I must say, that I think him greatly to blame.



<P>What right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged,



<P>and with manners so very disengaged?&nbsp; What right had he to endeavour



<P>to please, as he certainly did--to distinguish any one young woman with



<P>persevering attention, as he certainly did--while he really belonged



<P>to another?--How could he tell what mischief he might be doing?--



<P>How could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him?--



<P>very wrong, very wrong indeed."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And how could she bear such behaviour!&nbsp; Composure with a witness!



<P>to look on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman,



<P>before her face, and not resent it.--That is a degree of placidity,



<P>which I can neither comprehend nor respect."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he said



<P>so expressly.&nbsp; He had not time to enter into much explanation.



<P>He was here only a quarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation



<P>which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay--



<P>but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said.



<P>The present crisis, indeed, seemed to be brought on by them;



<P>and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the



<P>impropriety of his conduct."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Impropriety!&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Mrs. Weston--it is too calm a censure.



<P>Much, much beyond impropriety!--It has sunk him, I cannot say how



<P>it has sunk him in my opinion.&nbsp; So unlike what a man should be!--



<P>None of that upright integrity, that strict adherence to truth



<P>and principle, that disdain of trick and littleness, which a man



<P>should display in every transaction of his life."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has been



<P>wrong in this instance, I have known him long enough to answer



<P>for his having many, very many, good qualities; and--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Good God!" cried Emma, not attending to her.--"Mrs. Smallridge, too!



<P>Jane actually on the point of going as governess!&nbsp; What could he



<P>mean by such horrible indelicacy?&nbsp; To suffer her to engage herself--



<P>to suffer her even to think of such a measure!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He knew nothing about it, Emma.&nbsp; On this article I can fully



<P>acquit him.&nbsp; It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated



<P>to him--or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction.--



<P>Till yesterday, I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans.



<P>They burst on him, I do not know how, but by some letter or message--



<P>and it was the discovery of what she was doing, of this very project



<P>of hers, which determined him to come forward at once, own it



<P>all to his uncle, throw himself on his kindness, and, in short,



<P>put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been



<P>carrying on so long."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma began to listen better.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am to hear from him soon," continued Mrs. Weston.&nbsp; "He told

me



<P>at parting, that he should soon write; and he spoke in a manner which



<P>seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now.



<P>Let us wait, therefore, for this letter.&nbsp; It may bring many extenuations.



<P>It may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are



<P>not to be understood.&nbsp; Don't let us be severe, don't let us be

in



<P>a hurry to condemn him.&nbsp; Let us have patience.&nbsp; I must love

him;



<P>and now that I am satisfied on one point, the one material point,



<P>I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well, and ready



<P>to hope that it may.&nbsp; They must both have suffered a great deal



<P>under such a system of secresy and concealment."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"His sufferings," replied Emma dryly, "do not appear to have done



<P>him much harm.&nbsp; Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Most favourably for his nephew--gave his consent with scarcely



<P>a difficulty.&nbsp; Conceive what the events of a week have done



<P>in that family!&nbsp; While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there



<P>could not have been a hope, a chance, a possibility;--but scarcely



<P>are her remains at rest in the family vault, than her husband is



<P>persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required.



<P>What a blessing it is, when undue influence does not survive the grave!--



<P>He gave his consent with very little persuasion."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah!" thought Emma, "he would have done as much for Harriet."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light



<P>this morning.&nbsp; He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates's, I fancy,



<P>some time--and then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get



<P>back to his uncle, to whom he is just now more necessary than ever,



<P>that, as I tell you, he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.--



<P>He was very much agitated--very much, indeed--to a degree that made



<P>him appear quite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen



<P>him before.--In addition to all the rest, there had been the shock of



<P>finding her so very unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of--



<P>and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on



<P>with such perfect secresy?--The Campbells, the Dixons, did none



<P>of them know of the engagement?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"None; not one.&nbsp; He positively said that it had been known to no



<P>being in the world but their two selves."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well," said Emma, "I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled



<P>to the idea, and I wish them very happy.&nbsp; But I shall always



<P>think it a very abominable sort of proceeding.&nbsp; What has it been



<P>but a system of hypocrisy and deceit,--espionage, and treachery?--



<P>To come among us with professions of openness and simplicity;



<P>and such a league in secret to judge us all!--Here have we been,



<P>the whole winter and spring, completely duped, fancying ourselves



<P>all on an equal footing of truth and honour, with two people in the



<P>midst of us who may have been carrying round, comparing and sitting



<P>in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both



<P>to hear.--They must take the consequence, if they have heard each



<P>other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am quite easy on that head," replied Mrs. Weston.&nbsp; "I am



<P>very sure that I never said any thing of either to the other,



<P>which both might not have heard."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are in luck.--Your only blunder was confined to my ear,



<P>when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"True.&nbsp; But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss



<P>Fairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her;



<P>and as to speaking ill of him, there I must have been safe."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the window,



<P>evidently on the watch.&nbsp; His wife gave him a look which invited



<P>him in; and, while he was coming round, added, "Now, dearest Emma,



<P>let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his



<P>heart at ease, and incline him to be satisfied with the match.



<P>Let us make the best of it--and, indeed, almost every thing may



<P>be fairly said in her favour.&nbsp; It is not a connexion to gratify;



<P>but if Mr. Churchill does not feel that, why should we? and it



<P>may be a very fortunate circumstance for him, for Frank, I mean,



<P>that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness



<P>of character and good judgment as I have always given her credit for--



<P>and still am disposed to give her credit for, in spite of this



<P>one great deviation from the strict rule of right.&nbsp; And how much



<P>may be said in her situation for even that error!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Much, indeed!" cried Emma feelingly.&nbsp; "If a woman can ever



<P>be excused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation



<P>like Jane Fairfax's.--Of such, one may almost say, that `the



<P>world is not their's, nor the world's law.'"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She met Mr. Weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance,



<P>exclaiming,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word!



<P>This was a device, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity,



<P>and exercise my talent of guessing.&nbsp; But you really frightened

me.



<P>I thought you had lost half your property, at least.&nbsp; And here,



<P>instead of its being a matter of condolence, it turns out to be one



<P>of congratulation.--I congratulate you, Mr. Weston, with all my heart,



<P>on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished



<P>young women in England for your daughter."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all was



<P>as right as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spirits



<P>was immediate.&nbsp; His air and voice recovered their usual briskness:



<P>he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered



<P>on the subject in a manner to prove, that he now only wanted



<P>time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing.



<P>His companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence,



<P>or smooth objections; and by the time they had talked it all



<P>over together, and he had talked it all over again with Emma,



<P>in their walk back to Hartfield, he was become perfectly reconciled,



<P>and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank could



<P>possibly have done.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>"Harriet, poor Harriet!"--Those were the words; in them lay the



<P>tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constituted



<P>the real misery of the business to her.&nbsp; Frank Churchill had behaved



<P>very ill by herself--very ill in many ways,--but it was not so much



<P>his behaviour as her own, which made her so angry with him.



<P>It was the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet's account,



<P>that gave the deepest hue to his offence.--Poor Harriet! to be a second



<P>time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery.&nbsp; Mr. Knightley



<P>had spoken prophetically, when he once said, "Emma, you have been



<P>no friend to Harriet Smith."--She was afraid she had done her nothing



<P>but disservice.--It was true that she had not to charge herself,



<P>in this instance as in the former, with being the sole and original



<P>author of the mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might



<P>otherwise never have entered Harriet's imagination; for Harriet



<P>had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill



<P>before she had ever given her a hint on the subject; but she felt



<P>completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed.



<P>She might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments.



<P>Her influence would have been enough.&nbsp; And now she was very conscious



<P>that she ought to have prevented them.--She felt that she had been



<P>risking her friend's happiness on most insufficient grounds.



<P>Common sense would have directed her to tell Harriet, that she



<P>must not allow herself to think of him, and that there were five



<P>hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her.--"But, with



<P>common sense," she added, "I am afraid I have had little to do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was extremely angry with herself.&nbsp; If she could not have been



<P>angry with Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.--



<P>As for Jane Fairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings



<P>from any present solicitude on her account.&nbsp; Harriet would



<P>be anxiety enough; she need no longer be unhappy about Jane,



<P>whose troubles and whose ill-health having, of course, the same origin,



<P>must be equally under cure.--Her days of insignificance and evil



<P>were over.--She would soon be well, and happy, and prosperous.--



<P>Emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted.



<P>This discovery laid many smaller matters open.&nbsp; No doubt it had

been



<P>from jealousy.--In Jane's eyes she had been a rival; and well might



<P>any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed.



<P>An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack,



<P>and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison.



<P>She understood it all; and as far as her mind could disengage itself



<P>from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she acknowledged



<P>that Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond



<P>her desert.&nbsp; But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge!



<P>There was little sympathy to be spared for any body else.



<P>Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be



<P>more severe than the first.&nbsp; Considering the very superior claims



<P>of the object, it ought; and judging by its apparently stronger effect



<P>on Harriet's mind, producing reserve and self-command, it would.--



<P>She must communicate the painful truth, however, and as soon



<P>as possible.&nbsp; An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston's



<P>parting words.&nbsp; "For the present, the whole affair was to be



<P>completely a secret.&nbsp; Mr. Churchill had made a point of it,



<P>as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost;



<P>and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum."--



<P>Emma had promised; but still Harriet must be excepted.&nbsp; It was

her



<P>superior duty.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In spite of her vexation, she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous,



<P>that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to



<P>perform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through by herself.



<P>The intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to her,



<P>she was now to be anxiously announcing to another.&nbsp; Her heart beat



<P>quick on hearing Harriet's footstep and voice; so, she supposed,



<P>had poor Mrs. Weston felt when she was approaching Randalls.



<P>Could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!--



<P>But of that, unfortunately, there could be no chance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, Miss Woodhouse!" cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the room--



<P>"is not this the oddest news that ever was?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What news do you mean?" replied Emma, unable to guess, by look



<P>or voice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"About Jane Fairfax.&nbsp; Did you ever hear any thing so strange?



<P>Oh!--you need not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has



<P>told me himself.&nbsp; I met him just now.&nbsp; He told me it was to

be



<P>a great secret; and, therefore, I should not think of mentioning



<P>it to any body but you, but he said you knew it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What did Mr. Weston tell you?"--said Emma, still perplexed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! he told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank



<P>Churchill are to be married, and that they have been privately



<P>engaged to one another this long while.&nbsp; How very odd!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was, indeed, so odd; Harriet's behaviour was so extremely odd,



<P>that Emma did not know how to understand it.&nbsp; Her character appeared



<P>absolutely changed.&nbsp; She seemed to propose shewing no agitation,



<P>or disappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery.&nbsp; Emma

looked



<P>at her, quite unable to speak.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Had you any idea," cried Harriet, "of his being in love



<P>with her?--You, perhaps, might.--You (blushing as she spoke)



<P>who can see into every body's heart; but nobody else--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Upon my word," said Emma, "I begin to doubt my having any such talent.



<P>Can you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him attached



<P>to another woman at the very time that I was--tacitly, if not openly--



<P>encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never had



<P>the slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. Frank



<P>Churchill's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax.&nbsp; You may

be



<P>very sure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Me!" cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished.&nbsp; "Why should you



<P>caution me?--You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,"



<P>replied Emma, smiling; "but you do not mean to deny that there



<P>was a time--and not very distant either--when you gave me reason



<P>to understand that you did care about him?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Him!--never, never.&nbsp; Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake

me?"



<P>turning away distressed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Harriet!" cried Emma, after a moment's pause--"What do you mean?--



<P>Good Heaven! what do you mean?--Mistake you!--Am I to suppose then?--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She could not speak another word.--Her voice was lost; and she



<P>sat down, waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned



<P>from her, did not immediately say any thing; and when she did speak,



<P>it was in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma's.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I should not have thought it possible," she began, "that you



<P>could have misunderstood me!&nbsp; I know we agreed never to name him--



<P>but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else,



<P>I should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed



<P>to mean any other person.&nbsp; Mr. Frank Churchill, indeed!&nbsp; I

do not



<P>know who would ever look at him in the company of the other.



<P>I hope I have a better taste than to think of Mr. Frank Churchill,



<P>who is like nobody by his side.&nbsp; And that you should have been



<P>so mistaken, is amazing!--I am sure, but for believing that you



<P>entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment,



<P>I should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost,



<P>to dare to think of him.&nbsp; At first, if you had not told me



<P>that more wonderful things had happened; that there had been



<P>matches of greater disparity (those were your very words);--



<P>I should not have dared to give way to--I should not have thought



<P>it possible--But if you, who had been always acquainted with him--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Harriet!" cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely--"Let us



<P>understand each other now, without the possibility of farther mistake.



<P>Are you speaking of--Mr. Knightley?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To be sure I am.&nbsp; I never could have an idea of any body else--



<P>and so I thought you knew.&nbsp; When we talked about him, it was as

clear



<P>as possible."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not quite," returned Emma, with forced calmness, "for all that



<P>you then said, appeared to me to relate to a different person.



<P>I could almost assert that you had named Mr. Frank Churchill.



<P>I am sure the service Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you,



<P>in protecting you from the gipsies, was spoken of."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh!&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I



<P>said on the occasion.&nbsp; I told you that I did not wonder at



<P>your attachment; that considering the service he had rendered you,



<P>it was extremely natural:--and you agreed to it, expressing yourself



<P>very warmly as to your sense of that service, and mentioning



<P>even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward



<P>to your rescue.--The impression of it is strong on my memory."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, dear," cried Harriet, "now I recollect what you mean; but I



<P>was thinking of something very different at the time.&nbsp; It was not



<P>the gipsies--it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant.&nbsp; No!

(with



<P>some elevation) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance--



<P>of Mr. Knightley's coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton



<P>would not stand up with me; and when there was no other partner in



<P>the room.&nbsp; That was the kind action; that was the noble benevolence



<P>and generosity; that was the service which made me begin to feel



<P>how superior he was to every other being upon earth."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Good God!" cried Emma, "this has been a most unfortunate--



<P>most deplorable mistake!--What is to be done?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me?



<P>At least, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been,



<P>if the other had been the person; and now--it is possible--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She paused a few moments.&nbsp; Emma could not speak.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse," she resumed, "that you should feel



<P>a great difference between the two, as to me or as to any body.



<P>You must think one five hundred million times more above me than



<P>the other.&nbsp; But I hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing--that if--



<P>strange as it may appear--.&nbsp; But you know they were your own words,



<P>that more wonderful things had happened, matches of greater disparity



<P>had taken place than between Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore,



<P>it seems as if such a thing even as this, may have occurred before--



<P>and if I should be so fortunate, beyond expression, as to--



<P>if Mr. Knightley should really--if he does not mind the disparity,



<P>I hope, dear Miss Woodhouse, you will not set yourself against it,



<P>and try to put difficulties in the way.&nbsp; But you are too good for

that,



<P>I am sure."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet was standing at one of the windows.&nbsp; Emma turned round



<P>to look at her in consternation, and hastily said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley's returning your affection?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully--"I must say



<P>that I have."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma's eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she sat silently meditating,



<P>in a fixed attitude, for a few minutes.&nbsp; A few minutes were sufficient



<P>for making her acquainted with her own heart.&nbsp; A mind like hers,



<P>once opening to suspicion, made rapid progress.&nbsp; She touched--



<P>she admitted--she acknowledged the whole truth.&nbsp; Why was it



<P>so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley,



<P>than with Frank Churchill?&nbsp; Why was the evil so dreadfully increased



<P>by Harriet's having some hope of a return?&nbsp; It darted through her,



<P>with the speed of an arrow, that Mr. Knightley must marry no one



<P>but herself!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her own conduct, as well as her own heart, was before her in the



<P>same few minutes.&nbsp; She saw it all with a clearness which had



<P>never blessed her before.&nbsp; How improperly had she been acting



<P>by Harriet!&nbsp; How inconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational,



<P>how unfeeling had been her conduct!&nbsp; What blindness, what madness,



<P>had led her on!&nbsp; It struck her with dreadful force, and she



<P>was ready to give it every bad name in the world.&nbsp; Some portion



<P>of respect for herself, however, in spite of all these demerits--



<P>some concern for her own appearance, and a strong sense of justice



<P>by Harriet--(there would be no need of compassion to the girl



<P>who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley--but justice required



<P>that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,)



<P>gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness,



<P>with even apparent kindness.--For her own advantage indeed, it was fit



<P>that the utmost extent of Harriet's hopes should be enquired into;



<P>and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest



<P>which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained--or to deserve



<P>to be slighted by the person, whose counsels had never led her right.--



<P>Rousing from reflection, therefore, and subduing her emotion,



<P>she turned to Harriet again, and, in a more inviting accent, renewed



<P>the conversation; for as to the subject which had first introduced it,



<P>the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax, that was quite sunk and lost.--



<P>Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and themselves.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very glad



<P>to be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge,



<P>and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation,



<P>to give the history of her hopes with great, though trembling



<P>delight.--Emma's tremblings as she asked, and as she listened,



<P>were better concealed than Harriet's, but they were not less.



<P>Her voice was not unsteady; but her mind was in all the perturbation



<P>that such a development of self, such a burst of threatening evil,



<P>such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions, must create.--



<P>She listened with much inward suffering, but with great outward



<P>patience, to Harriet's detail.--Methodical, or well arranged,



<P>or very well delivered, it could not be expected to be;



<P>but it contained, when separated from all the feebleness and



<P>tautology of the narration, a substance to sink her spirit--



<P>especially with the corroborating circumstances, which her own memory



<P>brought in favour of Mr. Knightley's most improved opinion of Harriet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since



<P>those two decisive dances.--Emma knew that he had, on that occasion,



<P>found her much superior to his expectation.&nbsp; From that evening,



<P>or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse's encouraging her



<P>to think of him, Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking



<P>to her much more than he had been used to do, and of his having



<P>indeed quite a different manner towards her; a manner of kindness



<P>and sweetness!--Latterly she had been more and more aware of it.



<P>When they had been all walking together, he had so often come and walked



<P>by her, and talked so very delightfully!--He seemed to want to be



<P>acquainted with her.&nbsp; Emma knew it to have been very much the case.



<P>She had often observed the change, to almost the same extent.--



<P>Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him--



<P>and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had



<P>known of his opinion of Harriet.&nbsp; He praised her for being without



<P>art or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous, feelings.--



<P>She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet; he had dwelt



<P>on them to her more than once.--Much that lived in Harriet's memory,



<P>many little particulars of the notice she had received from him, a look,



<P>a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a compliment implied,



<P>a preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because unsuspected,



<P>by Emma.&nbsp; Circumstances that might swell to half an hour's relation,



<P>and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them, had passed



<P>undiscerned by her who now heard them; but the two latest occurrences



<P>to be mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet, were not



<P>without some degree of witness from Emma herself.--The first,



<P>was his walking with her apart from the others, in the lime-walk



<P>at Donwell, where they had been walking some time before Emma came,



<P>and he had taken pains (as she was convinced) to draw her from



<P>the rest to himself--and at first, he had talked to her in a more



<P>particular way than he had ever done before, in a very particular



<P>way indeed!--(Harriet could not recall it without a blush.) He seemed



<P>to be almost asking her, whether her affections were engaged.--



<P>But as soon as she (Miss Woodhouse) appeared likely to join them,



<P>he changed the subject, and began talking about farming:--



<P>The second, was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour



<P>before Emma came back from her visit, the very last morning of his



<P>being at Hartfield--though, when he first came in, he had said



<P>that he could not stay five minutes--and his having told her,



<P>during their conversation, that though he must go to London,



<P>it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all,



<P>which was much more (as Emma felt) than he had acknowledged to her.



<P>The superior degree of confidence towards Harriet, which this one



<P>article marked, gave her severe pain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she did,



<P>after a little reflection, venture the following question.



<P>"Might he not?--Is not it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought,



<P>into the state of your affections, he might be alluding to Mr. Martin--



<P>he might have Mr. Martin's interest in view?&nbsp; But Harriet rejected



<P>the suspicion with spirit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr. Martin!&nbsp; No indeed!--There was not a hint of Mr. Martin.



<P>I hope I know better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be



<P>suspected of it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Harriet had closed her evidence, she appealed to her dear



<P>Miss Woodhouse, to say whether she had not good ground for hope.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I never should have presumed to think of it at first," said she,



<P>"but for you.&nbsp; You told me to observe him carefully, and let



<P>his behaviour be the rule of mine--and so I have.&nbsp; But now I seem



<P>to feel that I may deserve him; and that if he does chuse me,



<P>it will not be any thing so very wonderful."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter



<P>feelings, made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma's side,



<P>to enable her to say on reply,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is



<P>the last man in the world, who would intentionally give any woman



<P>the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory;



<P>and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which at



<P>that moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of her



<P>father's footsteps.&nbsp; He was coming through the hall.&nbsp; Harriet

was



<P>too much agitated to encounter him.&nbsp; "She could not compose herself--



<P>Mr. Woodhouse would be alarmed--she had better go;"--with most ready



<P>encouragement from her friend, therefore, she passed off through



<P>another door--and the moment she was gone, this was the spontaneous



<P>burst of Emma's feelings:&nbsp; "Oh God! that I had never seen her!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough



<P>for her thoughts.--She was bewildered amidst the confusion



<P>of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours.



<P>Every moment had brought a fresh surprize; and every surprize



<P>must be matter of humiliation to her.--How to understand it all!



<P>How to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising



<P>on herself, and living under!--The blunders, the blindness of her



<P>own head and heart!--she sat still, she walked about, she tried her



<P>own room, she tried the shrubbery--in every place, every posture,



<P>she perceived that she had acted most weakly; that she had been imposed



<P>on by others in a most mortifying degree; that she had been imposing



<P>on herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that she was wretched,



<P>and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To understand, thoroughly understand her own heart, was the



<P>first endeavour.&nbsp; To that point went every leisure moment which

her



<P>father's claims on her allowed, and every moment of involuntary



<P>absence of mind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>How long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her, as every feeling



<P>declared him now to be?&nbsp; When had his influence, such influence

begun?--



<P>When had he succeeded to that place in her affection, which Frank



<P>Churchill had once, for a short period, occupied?--She looked back;



<P>she compared the two--compared them, as they had always stood in



<P>her estimation, from the time of the latter's becoming known to her--



<P>and as they must at any time have been compared by her, had it--



<P>oh! had it, by any blessed felicity, occurred to her, to institute



<P>the comparison.--She saw that there never had been a time when she



<P>did not consider Mr. Knightley as infinitely the superior, or when



<P>his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear.&nbsp; She

saw,



<P>that in persuading herself, in fancying, in acting to the contrary,



<P>she had been entirely under a delusion, totally ignorant of her



<P>own heart--and, in short, that she had never really cared for Frank



<P>Churchill at all!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection.



<P>This was the knowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry,



<P>which she reached; and without being long in reaching it.--



<P>She was most sorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation



<P>but the one revealed to her--her affection for Mr. Knightley.--



<P>Every other part of her mind was disgusting.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every



<P>body's feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every



<P>body's destiny.&nbsp; She was proved to have been universally mistaken;



<P>and she had not quite done nothing--for she had done mischief.



<P>She had brought evil on Harriet, on herself, and she too much feared,



<P>on Mr. Knightley.--Were this most unequal of all connexions to



<P>take place, on her must rest all the reproach of having given it



<P>a beginning; for his attachment, she must believe to be produced only



<P>by a consciousness of Harriet's;--and even were this not the case,



<P>he would never have known Harriet at all but for her folly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--It was a union to distance every



<P>wonder of the kind.--The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane



<P>Fairfax became commonplace, threadbare, stale in the comparison,



<P>exciting no surprize, presenting no disparity, affording nothing



<P>to be said or thought.--Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--Such an



<P>elevation on her side!&nbsp; Such a debasement on his!&nbsp; It was

horrible



<P>to Emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion,



<P>to foresee the smiles, the sneers, the merriment it would prompt at



<P>his expense; the mortification and disdain of his brother, the thousand



<P>inconveniences to himself.--Could it be?--No; it was impossible.



<P>And yet it was far, very far, from impossible.--Was it a new



<P>circumstance for a man of first-rate abilities to be captivated by



<P>very inferior powers?&nbsp; Was it new for one, perhaps too busy to

seek,



<P>to be the prize of a girl who would seek him?--Was it new for any



<P>thing in this world to be unequal, inconsistent, incongruous--or for



<P>chance and circumstance (as second causes) to direct the human fate?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Oh! had she never brought Harriet forward!&nbsp; Had she left her where



<P>she ought, and where he had told her she ought!--Had she not,



<P>with a folly which no tongue could express, prevented her marrying



<P>the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy



<P>and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong--



<P>all would have been safe; none of this dreadful sequel would have been.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise



<P>her thoughts to Mr. Knightley!--How she could dare to fancy



<P>herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it!--



<P>But Harriet was less humble, had fewer scruples than formerly.--



<P>Her inferiority, whether of mind or situation, seemed little felt.--



<P>She had seemed more sensible of Mr. Elton's being to stoop



<P>in marrying her, than she now seemed of Mr. Knightley's.--



<P>Alas! was not that her own doing too?&nbsp; Who had been at pains to

give



<P>Harriet notions of self-consequence but herself?--Who but herself



<P>had taught her, that she was to elevate herself if possible,



<P>and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment?--



<P>If Harriet, from being humble, were grown vain, it was her doing too.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>In this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June opened



<P>upon Hartfield.&nbsp; To Highbury in general it brought no material

change.



<P>The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings,



<P>and of the use to be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax



<P>was still at her grandmother's; and as the return of the Campbells



<P>from Ireland was again delayed, and August, instead of Midsummer,



<P>fixed for it, she was likely to remain there full two months longer,



<P>provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs. Elton's activity



<P>in her service, and save herself from being hurried into a delightful



<P>situation against her will.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had certainly



<P>taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growing to dislike



<P>him more.&nbsp; He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his



<P>pursuit of Emma.&nbsp; That Emma was his object appeared indisputable.



<P>Every thing declared it; his own attentions, his father's hints,



<P>his mother-in-law's guarded silence; it was all in unison;



<P>words, conduct, discretion, and indiscretion, told the same story.



<P>But while so many were devoting him to Emma, and Emma herself making

him



<P>over to Harriet, Mr. Knightley began to suspect him of some inclination



<P>to trifle with Jane Fairfax.&nbsp; He could not understand it; but there



<P>were symptoms of intelligence between them--he thought so at least--



<P>symptoms of admiration on his side, which, having once observed,



<P>he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning,



<P>however he might wish to escape any of Emma's errors of imagination.



<P>She was not present when the suspicion first arose.&nbsp; He was dining



<P>with the Randalls family, and Jane, at the Eltons'; and he had



<P>seen a look, more than a single look, at Miss Fairfax, which,



<P>from the admirer of Miss Woodhouse, seemed somewhat out of place.



<P>When he was again in their company, he could not help remembering



<P>what he had seen; nor could he avoid observations which, unless it



<P>were like Cowper and his fire at twilight,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Myself creating what I saw,"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something



<P>of private liking, of private understanding even, between Frank



<P>Churchill and Jane.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had walked up one day after dinner, as he very often did,



<P>to spend his evening at Hartfield.&nbsp; Emma and Harriet were going



<P>to walk; he joined them; and, on returning, they fell in with a



<P>larger party, who, like themselves, judged it wisest to take their



<P>exercise early, as the weather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston



<P>and their son, Miss Bates and her niece, who had accidentally met.



<P>They all united; and, on reaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it



<P>was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father,



<P>pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him.&nbsp; The Randalls



<P>party agreed to it immediately; and after a pretty long speech



<P>from Miss Bates, which few persons listened to, she also found it



<P>possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse's most obliging invitation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As they were turning into the grounds, Mr. Perry passed by on horseback.



<P>The gentlemen spoke of his horse.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"By the bye," said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently,



<P>"what became of Mr. Perry's plan of setting up his carriage?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, "I did not know that he



<P>ever had any such plan."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nay, I had it from you.&nbsp; You wrote me word of it three months

ago."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Me! impossible!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed you did.&nbsp; I remember it perfectly.&nbsp; You mentioned

it as



<P>what was certainly to be very soon.&nbsp; Mrs. Perry had told somebody,



<P>and was extremely happy about it.&nbsp; It was owing to her persuasion,



<P>as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal



<P>of harm.&nbsp; You must remember it now?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Never! really, never!--Bless me! how could it be?--Then I must



<P>have dreamt it--but I was completely persuaded--Miss Smith,



<P>you walk as if you were tired.&nbsp; You will not be sorry to find



<P>yourself at home."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What is this?--What is this?" cried Mr. Weston, "about Perry



<P>and a carriage?&nbsp; Is Perry going to set up his carriage, Frank?



<P>I am glad he can afford it.&nbsp; You had it from himself, had you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, sir," replied his son, laughing, "I seem to have had it



<P>from nobody.--Very odd!--I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston's



<P>having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago,



<P>with all these particulars--but as she declares she never heard



<P>a syllable of it before, of course it must have been a dream.&nbsp;

I am



<P>a great dreamer.&nbsp; I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away--



<P>and when I have gone through my particular friends, then I begin



<P>dreaming of Mr. and Mrs. Perry."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is odd though," observed his father, "that you should have had such



<P>a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you



<P>should be thinking of at Enscombe.&nbsp; Perry's setting up his carriage!



<P>and his wife's persuading him to it, out of care for his health--



<P>just what will happen, I have no doubt, some time or other;



<P>only a little premature.&nbsp; What an air of probability sometimes



<P>runs through a dream!&nbsp; And at others, what a heap of absurdities



<P>it is!&nbsp; Well, Frank, your dream certainly shews that Highbury is

in



<P>your thoughts when you are absent.&nbsp; Emma, you are a great dreamer,



<P>I think?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma was out of hearing.&nbsp; She had hurried on before her guests



<P>to prepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach



<P>of Mr. Weston's hint.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, to own the truth," cried Miss Bates, who had been trying in vain



<P>to be heard the last two minutes, "if I must speak on this subject,



<P>there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have--I do not



<P>mean to say that he did not dream it--I am sure I have sometimes



<P>the oddest dreams in the world--but if I am questioned about it,



<P>I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring;



<P>for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother, and the Coles



<P>knew of it as well as ourselves--but it was quite a secret,



<P>known to nobody else, and only thought of about three days.



<P>Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage, and came



<P>to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she



<P>had prevailed.&nbsp; Jane, don't you remember grandmama's telling us



<P>of it when we got home?&nbsp; I forget where we had been walking to--



<P>very likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to Randalls.



<P>Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother--indeed I do



<P>not know who is not--and she had mentioned it to her in confidence;



<P>she had no objection to her telling us, of course, but it was not



<P>to go beyond:&nbsp; and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it



<P>to a soul that I know of.&nbsp; At the same time, I will not positively



<P>answer for my having never dropt a hint, because I know I do



<P>sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware.&nbsp; I am a talker,



<P>you know; I am rather a talker; and now and then I have let a thing



<P>escape me which I should not.&nbsp; I am not like Jane; I wish I were.



<P>I will answer for it she never betrayed the least thing in the world.



<P>Where is she?--Oh! just behind.&nbsp; Perfectly remember Mrs. Perry's

coming.--



<P>Extraordinary dream, indeed!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They were entering the hall.&nbsp; Mr. Knightley's eyes had preceded



<P>Miss Bates's in a glance at Jane.&nbsp; From Frank Churchill's face,



<P>where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away,



<P>he had involuntarily turned to hers; but she was indeed behind,



<P>and too busy with her shawl.&nbsp; Mr. Weston had walked in.&nbsp; The

two



<P>other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass.&nbsp; Mr. Knightley



<P>suspected in Frank Churchill the determination of catching her eye--



<P>he seemed watching her intently--in vain, however, if it were so--



<P>Jane passed between them into the hall, and looked at neither.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was no time for farther remark or explanation.&nbsp; The dream

must



<P>be borne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round



<P>the large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield,



<P>and which none but Emma could have had power to place there and



<P>persuade her father to use, instead of the small-sized Pembroke,



<P>on which two of his daily meals had, for forty years been crowded.



<P>Tea passed pleasantly, and nobody seemed in a hurry to move.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Miss Woodhouse," said Frank Churchill, after examining a table



<P>behind him, which he could reach as he sat, "have your nephews taken



<P>away their alphabets--their box of letters?&nbsp; It used to stand here.



<P>Where is it?&nbsp; This is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought



<P>to be treated rather as winter than summer.&nbsp; We had great amusement



<P>with those letters one morning.&nbsp; I want to puzzle you again."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table



<P>was quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much



<P>disposed to employ as their two selves.&nbsp; They were rapidly forming



<P>words for each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled.



<P>The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for



<P>Mr. Woodhouse, who had often been distressed by the more animated sort,



<P>which Mr. Weston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily



<P>occupied in lamenting, with tender melancholy, over the departure



<P>of the "poor little boys," or in fondly pointing out, as he took



<P>up any stray letter near him, how beautifully Emma had written it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax.&nbsp; She gave



<P>a slight glance round the table, and applied herself to it.



<P>Frank was next to Emma, Jane opposite to them--and Mr. Knightley



<P>so placed as to see them all; and it was his object to see as much



<P>as he could, with as little apparent observation.&nbsp; The word



<P>was discovered, and with a faint smile pushed away.&nbsp; If meant



<P>to be immediately mixed with the others, and buried from sight,



<P>she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across,



<P>for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after every fresh word,



<P>and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell to work.



<P>She was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him for help.



<P>The word was blunder; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it,



<P>there was a blush on Jane's cheek which gave it a meaning not



<P>otherwise ostensible.&nbsp; Mr. Knightley connected it with the dream;



<P>but how it could all be, was beyond his comprehension.



<P>How the delicacy, the discretion of his favourite could have been



<P>so lain asleep!&nbsp; He feared there must be some decided involvement.



<P>Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn.



<P>These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick.



<P>It was a child's play, chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank



<P>Churchill's part.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With great indignation did he continue to observe him; with great



<P>alarm and distrust, to observe also his two blinded companions.



<P>He saw a short word prepared for Emma, and given to her with a look



<P>sly and demure.&nbsp; He saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found



<P>it highly entertaining, though it was something which she judged it



<P>proper to appear to censure; for she said, "Nonsense! for shame!"



<P>He heard Frank Churchill next say, with a glance towards Jane,



<P>"I will give it to her--shall I?"--and as clearly heard Emma



<P>opposing it with eager laughing warmth.&nbsp; "No, no, you must not;



<P>you shall not, indeed."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was done however.&nbsp; This gallant young man, who seemed to love



<P>without feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance,



<P>directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular



<P>degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it.&nbsp; Mr. Knightley's



<P>excessive curiosity to know what this word might be, made him seize



<P>every possible moment for darting his eye towards it, and it was



<P>not long before he saw it to be Dixon.&nbsp; Jane Fairfax's perception



<P>seemed to accompany his; her comprehension was certainly more equal



<P>to the covert meaning, the superior intelligence, of those five letters



<P>so arranged.&nbsp; She was evidently displeased; looked up, and seeing



<P>herself watched, blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her,



<P>and saying only, "I did not know that proper names were allowed,"



<P>pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit, and looked



<P>resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered.



<P>Her face was averted from those who had made the attack, and turned



<P>towards her aunt.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Aye, very true, my dear," cried the latter, though Jane had not



<P>spoken a word--"I was just going to say the same thing.&nbsp; It is

time



<P>for us to be going indeed.&nbsp; The evening is closing in, and grandmama



<P>will be looking for us.&nbsp; My dear sir, you are too obliging.



<P>We really must wish you good night."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jane's alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt



<P>had preconceived.&nbsp; She was immediately up, and wanting to quit



<P>the table; but so many were also moving, that she could not get away;



<P>and Mr. Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously



<P>pushed towards her, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined.



<P>She was afterwards looking for her shawl--Frank Churchill was



<P>looking also--it was growing dusk, and the room was in confusion;



<P>and how they parted, Mr. Knightley could not tell.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his thoughts full



<P>of what he had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist



<P>his observations, he must--yes, he certainly must, as a friend--



<P>an anxious friend--give Emma some hint, ask her some question.



<P>He could not see her in a situation of such danger, without trying to



<P>preserve her.&nbsp; It was his duty.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Pray, Emma," said he, "may I ask in what lay the great amusement,



<P>the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax?



<P>I saw the word, and am curious to know how it could be so very



<P>entertaining to the one, and so very distressing to the other."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma was extremely confused.&nbsp; She could not endure to give him

the



<P>true explanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed,



<P>she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh!" she cried in evident embarrassment, "it all meant nothing;



<P>a mere joke among ourselves."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The joke," he replied gravely, "seemed confined to you



<P>and Mr. Churchill."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had hoped she would speak again, but she did not.&nbsp; She would



<P>rather busy herself about any thing than speak.&nbsp; He sat a little



<P>while in doubt.&nbsp; A variety of evils crossed his mind.&nbsp; Interference--



<P>fruitless interference.&nbsp; Emma's confusion, and the acknowledged

intimacy,



<P>seemed to declare her affection engaged.&nbsp; Yet he would speak.



<P>He owed it to her, to risk any thing that might be involved in



<P>an unwelcome interference, rather than her welfare; to encounter



<P>any thing, rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Emma," said he at last, with earnest kindness, "do you



<P>think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between



<P>the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax?&nbsp; Oh! yes, perfectly.--



<P>Why do you make a doubt of it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her,



<P>or that she admired him?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Never, never!" she cried with a most open eagerness--"Never, for



<P>the twentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me.



<P>And how could it possibly come into your head?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them--



<P>certain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to be public."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! you amuse me excessively.&nbsp; I am delighted to find that you



<P>can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander--but it will not do--



<P>very sorry to check you in your first essay--but indeed it will



<P>not do.&nbsp; There is no admiration between them, I do assure you;



<P>and the appearances which have caught you, have arisen from some



<P>peculiar circumstances--feelings rather of a totally different nature--



<P>it is impossible exactly to explain:--there is a good deal of



<P>nonsense in it--but the part which is capable of being communicated,



<P>which is sense, is, that they are as far from any attachment or



<P>admiration for one another, as any two beings in the world can be.



<P>That is, I presume it to be so on her side, and I can answer for its



<P>being so on his.&nbsp; I will answer for the gentleman's indifference."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction



<P>which silenced, Mr. Knightley.&nbsp; She was in gay spirits, and would



<P>have prolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars



<P>of his suspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows



<P>of a circumstance which highly entertained her:&nbsp; but his gaiety

did



<P>not meet hers.&nbsp; He found he could not be useful, and his feelings



<P>were too much irritated for talking.&nbsp; That he might not be irritated



<P>into an absolute fever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse's tender



<P>habits required almost every evening throughout the year, he soon



<P>afterwards took a hasty leave, and walked home to the coolness



<P>and solitude of Donwell Abbey.

<B>CHAPTER XIII</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>The weather continued much the same all the following morning;



<P>and the same loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to



<P>reign at Hartfield--but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind



<P>changed into a softer quarter; the clouds were carried off;



<P>the sun appeared; it was summer again.&nbsp; With all the eagerness



<P>which such a transition gives, Emma resolved to be out of doors



<P>as soon as possible.&nbsp; Never had the exquisite sight, smell,



<P>sensation of nature, tranquil, warm, and brilliant after a storm,



<P>been more attractive to her.&nbsp; She longed for the serenity they

might



<P>gradually introduce; and on Mr. Perry's coming in soon after dinner,



<P>with a disengaged hour to give her father, she lost no time ill



<P>hurrying into the shrubbery.--There, with spirits freshened,



<P>and thoughts a little relieved, she had taken a few turns, when she



<P>saw Mr. Knightley passing through the garden door, and coming



<P>towards her.--It was the first intimation of his being returned



<P>from London.&nbsp; She had been thinking of him the moment before,



<P>as unquestionably sixteen miles distant.--There was time only for



<P>the quickest arrangement of mind.&nbsp; She must be collected and calm.



<P>In half a minute they were together.&nbsp; The "How d'ye do's" were

quiet



<P>and constrained on each side.&nbsp; She asked after their mutual friends;



<P>they were all well.--When had he left them?--Only that morning.



<P>He must have had a wet ride.--Yes.--He meant to walk with her,



<P>she found.&nbsp; "He had just looked into the dining-room, and as he



<P>was not wanted there, preferred being out of doors."--She thought



<P>he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully; and the first possible



<P>cause for it, suggested by her fears, was, that he had perhaps been



<P>communicating his plans to his brother, and was pained by the manner



<P>in which they had been received.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They walked together.&nbsp; He was silent.&nbsp; She thought he was

often



<P>looking at her, and trying for a fuller view of her face than it



<P>suited her to give.&nbsp; And this belief produced another dread.



<P>Perhaps he wanted to speak to her, of his attachment to Harriet;



<P>he might be watching for encouragement to begin.--She did not,



<P>could not, feel equal to lead the way to any such subject.



<P>He must do it all himself.&nbsp; Yet she could not bear this silence.



<P>With him it was most unnatural.&nbsp; She considered--resolved--and,

trying



<P>to smile, began--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather



<P>surprize you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Have I?" said he quietly, and looking at her; "of what nature?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! the best nature in the world--a wedding."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After waiting a moment, as if to be sure she intended to say no more,



<P>he replied,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard



<P>that already."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How is it possible?" cried Emma, turning her glowing cheeks



<P>towards him; for, while she spoke, it occurred to her that he



<P>might have called at Mrs. Goddard's in his way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning,



<P>and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little



<P>more composure,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you have



<P>had your suspicions.--I have not forgotten that you once tried to give



<P>me a caution.--I wish I had attended to it--but--(with a sinking



<P>voice and a heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed to blindness."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For a moment or two nothing was said, and she was unsuspicious



<P>of having excited any particular interest, till she found her arm



<P>drawn within his, and pressed against his heart, and heard him



<P>thus saying, in a tone of great sensibility, speaking low,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.--Your own



<P>excellent sense--your exertions for your father's sake--I know



<P>you will not allow yourself--."&nbsp; Her arm was pressed again,



<P>as he added, in a more broken and subdued accent, "The feelings



<P>of the warmest friendship--Indignation--Abominable scoundrel!"--



<P>And in a louder, steadier tone, he concluded with, "He will soon



<P>be gone.&nbsp; They will soon be in Yorkshire.&nbsp; I am sorry for

her.



<P>She deserves a better fate."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma understood him; and as soon as she could recover from the



<P>flutter of pleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are very kind--but you are mistaken--and I must set you right.--



<P>I am not in want of that sort of compassion.&nbsp; My blindness to what



<P>was going on, led me to act by them in a way that I must always



<P>be ashamed of, and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many



<P>things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures, but I



<P>have no other reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Emma!" cried he, looking eagerly at her, "are you, indeed?"--



<P>but checking himself--"No, no, I understand you--forgive me--I am



<P>pleased that you can say even so much.--He is no object of regret,



<P>indeed! and it will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes



<P>the acknowledgment of more than your reason.--Fortunate that your



<P>affections were not farther entangled!--I could never, I confess,



<P>from your manners, assure myself as to the degree of what you felt--



<P>I could only be certain that there was a preference--and a preference



<P>which I never believed him to deserve.--He is a disgrace to the name



<P>of man.--And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman?--



<P>Jane, Jane, you will be a miserable creature."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr. Knightley," said Emma, trying to be lively, but really confused--



<P>"I am in a very extraordinary situation.&nbsp; I cannot let you continue

in



<P>your error; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an impression,



<P>I have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have



<P>been at all attached to the person we are speaking of, as it might



<P>be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.--



<P>But I never have."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He listened in perfect silence.&nbsp; She wished him to speak, but he



<P>would not.&nbsp; She supposed she must say more before she were entitled



<P>to his clemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower



<P>herself in his opinion.&nbsp; She went on, however.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have very little to say for my own conduct.--I was tempted



<P>by his attentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.--



<P>An old story, probably--a common case--and no more than has happened



<P>to hundreds of my sex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable



<P>in one who sets up as I do for Understanding.&nbsp; Many circumstances



<P>assisted the temptation.&nbsp; He was the son of Mr. Weston--he was



<P>continually here--I always found him very pleasant--and, in short,



<P>for (with a sigh) let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously,



<P>they all centre in this at last--my vanity was flattered, and I



<P>allowed his attentions.&nbsp; Latterly, however--for some time, indeed--



<P>I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.--I thought them



<P>a habit, a trick, nothing that called for seriousness on my side.



<P>He has imposed on me, but he has not injured me.&nbsp; I have never

been



<P>attached to him.&nbsp; And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour.



<P>He never wished to attach me.&nbsp; It was merely a blind to conceal



<P>his real situation with another.--It was his object to blind



<P>all about him; and no one, I am sure, could be more effectually



<P>blinded than myself--except that I was not blinded--that it was my



<P>good fortune--that, in short, I was somehow or other safe from him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had hoped for an answer here--for a few words to say that her



<P>conduct was at least intelligible; but he was silent; and, as far



<P>as she could judge, deep in thought.&nbsp; At last, and tolerably



<P>in his usual tone, he said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.--I can suppose,



<P>however, that I may have underrated him.&nbsp; My acquaintance with



<P>him has been but trifling.--And even if I have not underrated



<P>him hitherto, he may yet turn out well.--With such a woman he has



<P>a chance.--I have no motive for wishing him ill--and for her sake,



<P>whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct,



<P>I shall certainly wish him well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have no doubt of their being happy together," said Emma;



<P>"I believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He is a most fortunate man!" returned Mr. Knightley, with energy.



<P>"So early in life--at three-and-twenty--a period when, if a man



<P>chuses a wife, he generally chuses ill.&nbsp; At three-and-twenty



<P>to have drawn such a prize!&nbsp; What years of felicity that man,



<P>in all human calculation, has before him!--Assured of the love of



<P>such a woman--the disinterested love, for Jane Fairfax's character



<P>vouches for her disinterestedness; every thing in his favour,--



<P>equality of situation--I mean, as far as regards society, and all the



<P>habits and manners that are important; equality in every point but one--



<P>and that one, since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted,



<P>such as must increase his felicity, for it will be his to bestow the



<P>only advantages she wants.--A man would always wish to give a woman



<P>a better home than the one he takes her from; and he who can do it,



<P>where there is no doubt of her regard, must, I think, be the happiest



<P>of mortals.--Frank Churchill is, indeed, the favourite of fortune.



<P>Every thing turns out for his good.--He meets with a young woman



<P>at a watering-place, gains her affection, cannot even weary her



<P>by negligent treatment--and had he and all his family sought round



<P>the world for a perfect wife for him, they could not have found



<P>her superior.--His aunt is in the way.--His aunt dies.--He has



<P>only to speak.--His friends are eager to promote his happiness.--



<P>He had used every body ill--and they are all delighted to forgive him.--



<P>He is a fortunate man indeed!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You speak as if you envied him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And I do envy him, Emma.&nbsp; In one respect he is the object of my

envy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma could say no more.&nbsp; They seemed to be within half a sentence



<P>of Harriet, and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject,



<P>if possible.&nbsp; She made her plan; she would speak of something



<P>totally different--the children in Brunswick Square; and she



<P>only waited for breath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her,



<P>by saying,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You will not ask me what is the point of envy.--You are determined,



<P>I see, to have no curiosity.--You are wise--but I cannot be wise.



<P>Emma, I must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it



<P>unsaid the next moment."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! then, don't speak it, don't speak it," she eagerly cried.



<P>"Take a little time, consider, do not commit yourself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you," said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and not



<P>another syllable followed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma could not bear to give him pain.&nbsp; He was wishing to confide

in her--



<P>perhaps to consult her;--cost her what it would, she would listen.



<P>She might assist his resolution, or reconcile him to it;



<P>she might give just praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him



<P>his own independence, relieve him from that state of indecision,



<P>which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind



<P>as his.--They had reached the house.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are going in, I suppose?" said he.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No,"--replied Emma--quite confirmed by the depressed manner



<P>in which he still spoke--"I should like to take another turn.



<P>Mr. Perry is not gone."&nbsp; And, after proceeding a few steps, she

added--



<P>"I stopped you ungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid,



<P>gave you pain.--But if you have any wish to speak openly to me



<P>as a friend, or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have



<P>in contemplation--as a friend, indeed, you may command me.--I will



<P>hear whatever you like.&nbsp; I will tell you exactly what I think."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"As a friend!"--repeated Mr. Knightley.--"Emma, that I fear is



<P>a word--No, I have no wish--Stay, yes, why should I hesitate?--



<P>I have gone too far already for concealment.--Emma, I accept your offer--



<P>Extraordinary as it may seem, I accept it, and refer myself to you



<P>as a friend.--Tell me, then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He stopped in his earnestness to look the question, and the expression



<P>of his eyes overpowered her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dearest Emma," said he, "for dearest you will always be,



<P>whatever the event of this hour's conversation, my dearest,



<P>most beloved Emma--tell me at once.&nbsp; Say `No,' if it is to be said."--



<P>She could really say nothing.--"You are silent," he cried,



<P>with great animation; "absolutely silent! at present I ask no more."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment.



<P>The dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps



<P>the most prominent feeling.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I cannot make speeches, Emma:"&nbsp; he soon resumed; and in a tone



<P>of such sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was



<P>tolerably convincing.--"If I loved you less, I might be able



<P>to talk about it more.&nbsp; But you know what I am.--You hear nothing



<P>but truth from me.--I have blamed you, and lectured you, and you



<P>have borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it.--



<P>Bear with the truths I would tell you now, dearest Emma, as well as



<P>you have borne with them.&nbsp; The manner, perhaps, may have as little



<P>to recommend them.&nbsp; God knows, I have been a very indifferent lover.--



<P>But you understand me.--Yes, you see, you understand my feelings--



<P>and will return them if you can.&nbsp; At present, I ask only to hear,



<P>once to hear your voice."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While he spoke, Emma's mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderful



<P>velocity of thought, had been able--and yet without losing a word--



<P>to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that



<P>Harriet's hopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion,



<P>as complete a delusion as any of her own--that Harriet was nothing;



<P>that she was every thing herself; that what she had been saying



<P>relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her



<P>own feelings; and that her agitation, her doubts, her reluctance,



<P>her discouragement, had been all received as discouragement



<P>from herself.--And not only was there time for these convictions,



<P>with all their glow of attendant happiness; there was time also to



<P>rejoice that Harriet's secret had not escaped her, and to resolve



<P>that it need not, and should not.--It was all the service she could



<P>now render her poor friend; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment



<P>which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection



<P>from herself to Harriet, as infinitely the most worthy of the two--



<P>or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him



<P>at once and for ever, without vouchsafing any motive, because he



<P>could not marry them both, Emma had it not.&nbsp; She felt for Harriet,



<P>with pain and with contrition; but no flight of generosity run mad,



<P>opposing all that could be probable or reasonable, entered her brain.



<P>She had led her friend astray, and it would be a reproach to



<P>her for ever; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings,



<P>and as strong as it had ever been before, in reprobating any such



<P>alliance for him, as most unequal and degrading.&nbsp; Her way was clear,



<P>though not quite smooth.--She spoke then, on being so entreated.--



<P>What did she say?--Just what she ought, of course.&nbsp; A lady always

does.--



<P>She said enough to shew there need not be despair--and to invite him



<P>to say more himself.&nbsp; He had despaired at one period; he had received



<P>such an injunction to caution and silence, as for the time crushed



<P>every hope;--she had begun by refusing to hear him.--The change had



<P>perhaps been somewhat sudden;--her proposal of taking another turn,



<P>her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to,



<P>might be a little extraordinary!--She felt its inconsistency;



<P>but Mr. Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it, and seek no



<P>farther explanation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure;



<P>seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised,



<P>or a little mistaken; but where, as in this case, though the conduct



<P>is mistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be very material.--



<P>Mr. Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than



<P>she possessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence.



<P>He had followed her into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it.



<P>He had come, in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill's



<P>engagement, with no selfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring,



<P>if she allowed him an opening, to soothe or to counsel her.--The rest



<P>had been the work of the moment, the immediate effect of what he heard,



<P>on his feelings.&nbsp; The delightful assurance of her total indifference



<P>towards Frank Churchill, of her having a heart completely disengaged



<P>from him, had given birth to the hope, that, in time, he might gain



<P>her affection himself;--but it had been no present hope--he had only,



<P>in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment, aspired to be



<P>told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her.--The superior



<P>hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting.--



<P>The affection, which he had been asking to be allowed to create,



<P>if he could, was already his!--Within half an hour, he had passed



<P>from a thoroughly distressed state of mind, to something so like



<P>perfect happiness, that it could bear no other name.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her change was equal.--This one half-hour had given to each the



<P>same precious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each



<P>the same degree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.--On his side,



<P>there had been a long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival,



<P>or even the expectation, of Frank Churchill.--He had been in love



<P>with Emma, and jealous of Frank Churchill, from about the same period,



<P>one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other.



<P>It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill that had taken him from



<P>the country.--The Box Hill party had decided him on going away.



<P>He would save himself from witnessing again such permitted,



<P>encouraged attentions.--He had gone to learn to be indifferent.--



<P>But he had gone to a wrong place.&nbsp; There was too much domestic



<P>happiness in his brother's house; woman wore too amiable a form in it;



<P>Isabella was too much like Emma--differing only in those striking



<P>inferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy before him,



<P>for much to have been done, even had his time been longer.--He had



<P>stayed on, however, vigorously, day after day--till this very morning's



<P>post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.--Then, with the



<P>gladness which must be felt, nay, which he did not scruple to feel,



<P>having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma,



<P>was there so much fond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her,



<P>that he could stay no longer.&nbsp; He had ridden home through the rain;



<P>and had walked up directly after dinner, to see how this sweetest



<P>and best of all creatures, faultless in spite of all her faults,



<P>bore the discovery.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had found her agitated and low.--Frank Churchill was a villain.--



<P>He heard her declare that she had never loved him.&nbsp; Frank Churchill's



<P>character was not desperate.--She was his own Emma, by hand and word,



<P>when they returned into the house; and if he could have thought



<P>of Frank Churchill then, he might have deemed him a very good sort



<P>of fellow.

<B>CHAPTER VII</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>They had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward



<P>circumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality,



<P>were in favour of a pleasant party.&nbsp; Mr. Weston directed the whole,



<P>officiating safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every



<P>body was in good time.&nbsp; Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates



<P>and her niece, with the Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback.



<P>Mrs. Weston remained with Mr. Woodhouse.&nbsp; Nothing was wanting



<P>but to be happy when they got there.&nbsp; Seven miles were travelled



<P>in expectation of enjoyment, and every body had a burst of admiration



<P>on first arriving; but in the general amount of the day there



<P>was deficiency.&nbsp; There was a languor, a want of spirits, a want

of union,



<P>which could not be got over.&nbsp; They separated too much into parties.



<P>The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took charge of Miss



<P>Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill.



<P>And Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise better.&nbsp;

It seemed



<P>at first an accidental division, but it never materially varied.



<P>Mr. and Mrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness to mix,



<P>and be as agreeable as they could; but during the two whole hours



<P>that were spent on the hill, there seemed a principle of separation,



<P>between the other parties, too strong for any fine prospects, or any



<P>cold collation, or any cheerful Mr. Weston, to remove.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At first it was downright dulness to Emma.&nbsp; She had never seen

Frank



<P>Churchill so silent and stupid.&nbsp; He said nothing worth hearing--



<P>looked without seeing--admired without intelligence--listened without



<P>knowing what she said.&nbsp; While he was so dull, it was no wonder

that



<P>Harriet should be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When they all sat down it was better; to her taste a great deal better,



<P>for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her his first object.



<P>Every distinguishing attention that could be paid, was paid to her.



<P>To amuse her, and be agreeable in her eyes, seemed all that he



<P>cared for--and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to be flattered,



<P>was gay and easy too, and gave him all the friendly encouragement,



<P>the admission to be gallant, which she had ever given in the first



<P>and most animating period of their acquaintance; but which now,



<P>in her own estimation, meant nothing, though in the judgment of most



<P>people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no English



<P>word but flirtation could very well describe.&nbsp; "Mr. Frank Churchill



<P>and Miss Woodhouse flirted together excessively."&nbsp; They were laying



<P>themselves open to that very phrase--and to having it sent off



<P>in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady, to Ireland by another.



<P>Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity;



<P>it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected.



<P>She laughed because she was disappointed; and though she liked him



<P>for his attentions, and thought them all, whether in friendship,



<P>admiration, or playfulness, extremely judicious, they were not winning



<P>back her heart.&nbsp; She still intended him for her friend.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How much I am obliged to you," said he, "for telling me to come to-day!--



<P>If it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost all the



<P>happiness of this party.&nbsp; I had quite determined to go away again."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about,



<P>except that you were too late for the best strawberries.



<P>I was a kinder friend than you deserved.&nbsp; But you were humble.



<P>You begged hard to be commanded to come."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't say I was cross.&nbsp; I was fatigued.&nbsp; The heat overcame

me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is hotter to-day."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not to my feelings.&nbsp; I am perfectly comfortable to-day."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are comfortable because you are under command."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your command?--Yes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. You had,



<P>somehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from your



<P>own management; but to-day you are got back again--and as I cannot



<P>be always with you, it is best to believe your temper under your



<P>own command rather than mine."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It comes to the same thing.&nbsp; I can have no self-command without



<P>a motive.&nbsp; You order me, whether you speak or not.&nbsp; And you

can



<P>be always with me.&nbsp; You are always with me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dating from three o'clock yesterday.&nbsp; My perpetual influence



<P>could not begin earlier, or you would not have been so much



<P>out of humour before."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Three o'clock yesterday!&nbsp; That is your date.&nbsp; I thought I

had seen



<P>you first in February."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your gallantry is really unanswerable.&nbsp; But (lowering her voice)--



<P>nobody speaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much to be



<P>talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I say nothing of which I am ashamed," replied he, with lively impudence.



<P>"I saw you first in February.&nbsp; Let every body on the Hill hear

me if



<P>they can.&nbsp; Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side, and Dorking



<P>on the other.&nbsp; I saw you first in February."&nbsp; And then whispering--



<P>"Our companions are excessively stupid.&nbsp; What shall we do to rouse

them?



<P>Any nonsense will serve.&nbsp; They shall talk.&nbsp; Ladies and gentlemen,



<P>I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, wherever she is, presides)



<P>to say, that she desires to know what you are all thinking of?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Some laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a great

deal;



<P>Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse's presiding;



<P>Mr. Knightley's answer was the most distinct.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are



<P>all thinking of?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! no, no"--cried Emma, laughing as carelessly as she could--



<P>"Upon no account in the world.&nbsp; It is the very last thing I



<P>would stand the brunt of just now.&nbsp; Let me hear any thing rather



<P>than what you are all thinking of.&nbsp; I will not say quite all.



<P>There are one or two, perhaps, (glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet,)



<P>whose thoughts I might not be afraid of knowing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is a sort of thing," cried Mrs. Elton emphatically,



<P>"which I should not have thought myself privileged to



<P>inquire into.&nbsp; Though, perhaps, as the Chaperon of the party--



<P>I never was in any circle--exploring parties--young ladies--married

women--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband; and he murmured,



<P>in reply,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very true, my love, very true.&nbsp; Exactly so, indeed--quite unheard

of--



<P>but some ladies say any thing.&nbsp; Better pass it off as a joke.



<P>Every body knows what is due to you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It will not do," whispered Frank to Emma; "they are most



<P>of them affronted.&nbsp; I will attack them with more address.



<P>Ladies and gentlemen--I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she



<P>waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of,



<P>and only requires something very entertaining from each of you,



<P>in a general way.&nbsp; Here are seven of you, besides myself, (who,

she



<P>is pleased to say, am very entertaining already,) and she only



<P>demands from each of you either one thing very clever, be it prose



<P>or verse, original or repeated--or two things moderately clever--



<P>or three things very dull indeed, and she engages to laugh heartily



<P>at them all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! very well," exclaimed Miss Bates, "then I need not be uneasy.



<P>`Three things very dull indeed.'&nbsp; That will just do for me, you

know.



<P>I shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open



<P>my mouth, shan't I? (looking round with the most good-humoured



<P>dependence on every body's assent)--Do not you all think I shall?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma could not resist.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! ma'am, but there may be a difficulty.&nbsp; Pardon me--but you



<P>will be limited as to number--only three at once."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner, did not



<P>immediately catch her meaning; but, when it burst on her, it could



<P>not anger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah!--well--to be sure.&nbsp; Yes, I see what she means, (turning to



<P>Mr. Knightley,) and I will try to hold my tongue.&nbsp; I must make



<P>myself very disagreeable, or she would not have said such a thing



<P>to an old friend."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I like your plan," cried Mr. Weston.&nbsp; "Agreed, agreed.&nbsp; I

will do



<P>my best.&nbsp; I am making a conundrum.&nbsp; How will a conundrum reckon?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Low, I am afraid, sir, very low," answered his son;--"but we shall



<P>be indulgent--especially to any one who leads the way."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, no," said Emma, "it will not reckon low.&nbsp; A conundrum of



<P>Mr. Weston's shall clear him and his next neighbour.&nbsp; Come, sir,



<P>pray let me hear it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I doubt its being very clever myself," said Mr. Weston.



<P>"It is too much a matter of fact, but here it is.--What two letters



<P>of the alphabet are there, that express perfection?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What two letters!--express perfection!&nbsp; I am sure I do not know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! you will never guess.&nbsp; You, (to Emma), I am certain, will



<P>never guess.--I will tell you.--M. and A.--Em-ma.--Do you understand?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Understanding and gratification came together.&nbsp; It might be a very



<P>indifferent piece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh



<P>at and enjoy in it--and so did Frank and Harriet.--It did not seem



<P>to touch the rest of the party equally; some looked very stupid



<P>about it, and Mr. Knightley gravely said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr. Weston



<P>has done very well for himself; but he must have knocked up every



<P>body else.&nbsp; Perfection should not have come quite so soon."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! for myself, I protest I must be excused," said Mrs. Elton;



<P>"I really cannot attempt--I am not at all fond of the sort of thing.



<P>I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not



<P>at all pleased with.&nbsp; I knew who it came from.&nbsp; An abominable

puppy!--



<P>You know who I mean (nodding to her husband). These kind of things



<P>are very well at Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire;



<P>but quite out of place, in my opinion, when one is exploring



<P>about the country in summer.&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse must excuse me.



<P>I am not one of those who have witty things at every body's service.



<P>I do not pretend to be a wit.&nbsp; I have a great deal of vivacity



<P>in my own way, but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak



<P>and when to hold my tongue.&nbsp; Pass us, if you please, Mr. Churchill.



<P>Pass Mr. E., Knightley, Jane, and myself.&nbsp; We have nothing clever

to say--



<P>not one of us.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, yes, pray pass me," added her husband, with a sort of



<P>sneering consciousness; "I have nothing to say that can entertain



<P>Miss Woodhouse, or any other young lady.&nbsp; An old married man--



<P>quite good for nothing.&nbsp; Shall we walk, Augusta?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"With all my heart.&nbsp; I am really tired of exploring so long



<P>on one spot.&nbsp; Come, Jane, take my other arm."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off.



<P>"Happy couple!" said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out



<P>of hearing:--"How well they suit one another!--Very lucky--marrying

as



<P>they did, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!--They

only



<P>knew each other, I think, a few weeks in Bath!&nbsp; Peculiarly lucky!--



<P>for as to any real knowledge of a person's disposition that Bath,



<P>or any public place, can give--it is all nothing; there can be



<P>no knowledge.&nbsp; It is only by seeing women in their own homes,



<P>among their own set, just as they always are, that you can form



<P>any just judgment.&nbsp; Short of that, it is all guess and luck--



<P>and will generally be ill-luck. How many a man has committed himself



<P>on a short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest of his life!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her



<P>own confederates, spoke now.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Such things do occur, undoubtedly."--She was stopped by a cough.



<P>Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You were speaking," said he, gravely.&nbsp; She recovered her voice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate circumstances



<P>do sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot imagine them



<P>to be very frequent.&nbsp; A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise--



<P>but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards.&nbsp; I would



<P>be understood to mean, that it can be only weak, irresolute characters,



<P>(whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance,)



<P>who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience,



<P>an oppression for ever."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and soon



<P>afterwards said, in a lively tone,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever



<P>I marry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me.&nbsp; Will you?



<P>(turning to Emma.) Will you chuse a wife for me?--I am sure I



<P>should like any body fixed on by you.&nbsp; You provide for the family,



<P>you know, (with a smile at his father). Find some body for me.



<P>I am in no hurry.&nbsp; Adopt her, educate her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And make her like myself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"By all means, if you can."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very well.&nbsp; I undertake the commission.&nbsp; You shall have a

charming wife."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She must be very lively, and have hazle eyes.&nbsp; I care for nothing

else.



<P>I shall go abroad for a couple of years--and when I return,



<P>I shall come to you for my wife.&nbsp; Remember."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma was in no danger of forgetting.&nbsp; It was a commission to touch

every



<P>favourite feeling.&nbsp; Would not Harriet be the very creature described?



<P>Hazle eyes excepted, two years more might make her all that he wished.



<P>He might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment;



<P>who could say?&nbsp; Referring the education to her seemed to imply

it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now, ma'am," said Jane to her aunt, "shall we join Mrs. Elton?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If you please, my dear.&nbsp; With all my heart.&nbsp; I am quite ready.



<P>I was ready to have gone with her, but this will do just as well.



<P>We shall soon overtake her.&nbsp; There she is--no, that's somebody

else.



<P>That's one of the ladies in the Irish car party, not at all like her.--



<P>Well, I declare--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley.



<P>Mr. Weston, his son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young



<P>man's spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant.&nbsp; Even Emma

grew



<P>tired at last of flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather



<P>walking quietly about with any of the others, or sitting almost alone,



<P>and quite unattended to, in tranquil observation of the beautiful



<P>views beneath her.&nbsp; The appearance of the servants looking out



<P>for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight;



<P>and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart,



<P>and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have her carriage first,



<P>were gladly endured, in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was



<P>to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure.



<P>Such another scheme, composed of so many ill-assorted people,



<P>she hoped never to be betrayed into again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While waiting for the carriage, she found Mr. Knightley by her side.



<P>He looked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do:



<P>a privilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still



<P>use it.&nbsp; I cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance.



<P>How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates?&nbsp; How could you be

so



<P>insolent in your wit to a woman of her character, age, and situation?--



<P>Emma, I had not thought it possible."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nay, how could I help saying what I did?--Nobody could have helped

it.



<P>It was not so very bad.&nbsp; I dare say she did not understand me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I assure you she did.&nbsp; She felt your full meaning.&nbsp; She has

talked



<P>of it since.&nbsp; I wish you could have heard how she talked of it--



<P>with what candour and generosity.&nbsp; I wish you could have heard

her



<P>honouring your forbearance, in being able to pay her such attentions,



<P>as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father,



<P>when her society must be so irksome."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh!" cried Emma, "I know there is not a better creature in the world:



<P>but you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous are



<P>most unfortunately blended in her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They are blended," said he, "I acknowledge; and, were she prosperous,



<P>I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous



<P>over the good.&nbsp; Were she a woman of fortune, I would leave every



<P>harmless absurdity to take its chance, I would not quarrel with you



<P>for any liberties of manner.&nbsp; Were she your equal in situation--



<P>but, Emma, consider how far this is from being the case.&nbsp; She is

poor;



<P>she has sunk from the comforts she was born to; and, if she live



<P>to old age, must probably sink more.&nbsp; Her situation should secure



<P>your compassion.&nbsp; It was badly done, indeed!&nbsp; You, whom she

had known



<P>from an infant, whom she had seen grow up from a period when her



<P>notice was an honour, to have you now, in thoughtless spirits,



<P>and the pride of the moment, laugh at her, humble her--and before



<P>her niece, too--and before others, many of whom (certainly some,)



<P>would be entirely guided by your treatment of her.--This is not



<P>pleasant to you, Emma--and it is very far from pleasant to me;



<P>but I must, I will,--I will tell you truths while I can;



<P>satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel,



<P>and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice



<P>than you can do now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage;



<P>it was ready; and, before she could speak again, he had handed her in.



<P>He had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted,



<P>and her tongue motionless.&nbsp; They were combined only of anger



<P>against herself, mortification, and deep concern.&nbsp; She had not



<P>been able to speak; and, on entering the carriage, sunk back



<P>for a moment overcome--then reproaching herself for having taken



<P>no leave, making no acknowledgment, parting in apparent sullenness,



<P>she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference;



<P>but it was just too late.&nbsp; He had turned away, and the horses were



<P>in motion.&nbsp; She continued to look back, but in vain; and soon,



<P>with what appeared unusual speed, they were half way down the hill,



<P>and every thing left far behind.&nbsp; She was vexed beyond what could



<P>have been expressed--almost beyond what she could conceal.



<P>Never had she felt so agitated, mortified, grieved, at any circumstance



<P>in her life.&nbsp; She was most forcibly struck.&nbsp; The truth of

this



<P>representation there was no denying.&nbsp; She felt it at her heart.



<P>How could she have been so brutal, so cruel to Miss Bates!&nbsp; How

could



<P>she have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she valued!



<P>And how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude,



<P>of concurrence, of common kindness!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Time did not compose her.&nbsp; As she reflected more, she seemed



<P>but to feel it more.&nbsp; She never had been so depressed.&nbsp; Happily

it



<P>was not necessary to speak.&nbsp; There was only Harriet, who seemed

not



<P>in spirits herself, fagged, and very willing to be silent; and Emma



<P>felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home,



<P>without being at any trouble to check them, extraordinary as they were.

<B>CHAPTER VI</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>After being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and



<P>Mrs. Suckling, the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification



<P>of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn.



<P>No such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores



<P>at present.&nbsp; In the daily interchange of news, they must be again



<P>restricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings'



<P>coming had been united, such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill,



<P>whose health seemed every day to supply a different report,



<P>and the situation of Mrs. Weston, whose happiness it was to be hoped



<P>might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child,



<P>as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Elton was very much disappointed.&nbsp; It was the delay of a great



<P>deal of pleasure and parade.&nbsp; Her introductions and recommendations



<P>must all wait, and every projected party be still only talked of.



<P>So she thought at first;--but a little consideration convinced



<P>her that every thing need not be put off.&nbsp; Why should not they



<P>explore to Box Hill though the Sucklings did not come?&nbsp; They could



<P>go there again with them in the autumn.&nbsp; It was settled that they



<P>should go to Box Hill.&nbsp; That there was to be such a party had been



<P>long generally known:&nbsp; it had even given the idea of another.



<P>Emma had never been to Box Hill; she wished to see what every body



<P>found so well worth seeing, and she and Mr. Weston had agreed



<P>to chuse some fine morning and drive thither.&nbsp; Two or three more



<P>of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to



<P>be done in a quiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior



<P>to the bustle and preparation, the regular eating and drinking,



<P>and picnic parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was so very well understood between them, that Emma could



<P>not but feel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing



<P>from Mr. Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her



<P>brother and sister had failed her, that the two parties should unite,



<P>and go together; and that as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded



<P>to it, so it was to be, if she had no objection.&nbsp; Now, as her



<P>objection was nothing but her very great dislike of Mrs. Elton,



<P>of which Mr. Weston must already be perfectly aware, it was not worth



<P>bringing forward again:--it could not be done without a reproof



<P>to him, which would be giving pain to his wife; and she found



<P>herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she



<P>would have done a great deal to avoid; an arrangement which would



<P>probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of



<P>Mrs. Elton's party!&nbsp; Every feeling was offended; and the forbearance



<P>of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity



<P>in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston's temper.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am glad you approve of what I have done," said he very comfortably.



<P>"But I thought you would.&nbsp; Such schemes as these are nothing



<P>without numbers.&nbsp; One cannot have too large a party.&nbsp; A large

party



<P>secures its own amusement.&nbsp; And she is a good-natured woman after

all.



<P>One could not leave her out."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton



<P>was growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston



<P>as to pigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw



<P>every thing into sad uncertainty.&nbsp; It might be weeks, it might

be



<P>only a few days, before the horse were useable; but no preparations



<P>could be ventured on, and it was all melancholy stagnation.



<P>Mrs. Elton's resources were inadequate to such an attack.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Is not this most vexations, Knightley?" she cried.--"And such weather



<P>for exploring!--These delays and disappointments are quite odious.



<P>What are we to do?--The year will wear away at this rate,



<P>and nothing done.&nbsp; Before this time last year I assure you we had



<P>had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You had better explore to Donwell," replied Mr. Knightley.



<P>"That may be done without horses.&nbsp; Come, and eat my strawberries.



<P>They are ripening fast."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed

so,



<P>for his proposal was caught at with delight; and the "Oh!&nbsp; I should



<P>like it of all things," was not plainer in words than manner.



<P>Donwell was famous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for



<P>the invitation:&nbsp; but no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would

have



<P>been enough to tempt the lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere.



<P>She promised him again and again to come--much oftener than



<P>he doubted--and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy,



<P>such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You may depend upon me," said she.&nbsp; "I certainly will come.



<P>Name your day, and I will come.&nbsp; You will allow me to bring



<P>Jane Fairfax?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I cannot name a day," said he, "till I have spoken to some others



<P>whom I would wish to meet you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! leave all that to me.&nbsp; Only give me a carte-blanche.--I am



<P>Lady Patroness, you know.&nbsp; It is my party.&nbsp; I will bring friends



<P>with me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hope you will bring Elton," said he:&nbsp; "but I will not trouble



<P>you to give any other invitations."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! now you are looking very sly.&nbsp; But consider--you need not

be afraid



<P>of delegating power to me.&nbsp; I am no young lady on her preferment.



<P>Married women, you know, may be safely authorised.&nbsp; It is my party.



<P>Leave it all to me.&nbsp; I will invite your guests."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No,"--he calmly replied,--"there is but one married woman in the world



<P>whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell,



<P>and that one is--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"--Mrs. Weston, I suppose," interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather mortified.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No--Mrs. Knightley;--and till she is in being, I will manage



<P>such matters myself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! you are an odd creature!" she cried, satisfied to have no



<P>one preferred to herself.--"You are a humourist, and may say what



<P>you like.&nbsp; Quite a humourist.&nbsp; Well, I shall bring Jane with

me--



<P>Jane and her aunt.--The rest I leave to you.&nbsp; I have no objections



<P>at all to meeting the Hartfield family.&nbsp; Don't scruple.&nbsp; I

know



<P>you are attached to them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call



<P>on Miss Bates in my way home."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:--but as you like.



<P>It is to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing.



<P>I shall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets



<P>hanging on my arm.&nbsp; Here,--probably this basket with pink ribbon.



<P>Nothing can be more simple, you see.&nbsp; And Jane will have such another.



<P>There is to be no form or parade--a sort of gipsy party.&nbsp; We are



<P>to walk about your gardens, and gather the strawberries ourselves,



<P>and sit under trees;--and whatever else you may like to provide,



<P>it is to be all out of doors--a table spread in the shade, you know.



<P>Every thing as natural and simple as possible.&nbsp; Is not that your

idea?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not quite.&nbsp; My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have



<P>the table spread in the dining-room. The nature and the simplicity



<P>of gentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think



<P>is best observed by meals within doors.&nbsp; When you are tired of

eating



<P>strawberries in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well--as you please; only don't have a great set out.&nbsp; And, by

the bye,



<P>can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?--



<P>Pray be sincere, Knightley.&nbsp; If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges,



<P>or to inspect anything--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have not the least wish for it, I thank you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well--but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper



<P>is extremely clever."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as clever,



<P>and would spurn any body's assistance."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wish we had a donkey.&nbsp; The thing would be for us all to come



<P>on donkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me--and my caro sposo walking by.



<P>I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey.&nbsp; In a country



<P>life I conceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have



<P>ever so many resources, it is not possible for her to be always shut



<P>up at home;--and very long walks, you know--in summer there is dust,



<P>and in winter there is dirt."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury.



<P>Donwell Lane is never dusty, and now it is perfectly dry.&nbsp; Come

on



<P>a donkey, however, if you prefer it.&nbsp; You can borrow Mrs. Cole's.



<P>I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That I am sure you would.&nbsp; Indeed I do you justice, my good friend.



<P>Under that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have the



<P>warmest heart.&nbsp; As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist.--



<P>Yes, believe me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention



<P>to me in the whole of this scheme.&nbsp; You have hit upon the very

thing



<P>to please me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade.



<P>He wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party;



<P>and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors



<P>to eat would inevitably make him ill.&nbsp; Mr. Woodhouse must not,



<P>under the specious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two



<P>spent at Donwell, be tempted away to his misery.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was invited on good faith.&nbsp; No lurking horrors were to upbraid



<P>him for his easy credulity.&nbsp; He did consent.&nbsp; He had not been



<P>at Donwell for two years.&nbsp; "Some very fine morning, he, and Emma,



<P>and Harriet, could go very well; and he could sit still with



<P>Mrs. Weston, while the dear girls walked about the gardens.



<P>He did not suppose they could be damp now, in the middle of



<P>the day.&nbsp; He should like to see the old house again exceedingly,



<P>and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton, and any other



<P>of his neighbours.--He could not see any objection at all to his,



<P>and Emma's, and Harriet's going there some very fine morning.



<P>He thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them--



<P>very kind and sensible--much cleverer than dining out.--He was not



<P>fond of dining out."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Knightley was fortunate in every body's most ready concurrence.



<P>The invitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if,



<P>like Mrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular



<P>compliment to themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high



<P>expectations of pleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked,



<P>promised to get Frank over to join them, if possible; a proof



<P>of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with.--



<P>Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad



<P>to see him; and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no time in writing,



<P>and spare no arguments to induce him to come.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party



<P>to Box Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell



<P>was settled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,--the weather



<P>appearing exactly right.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Under a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse



<P>was safely conveyed in his carriage, with one window down,



<P>to partake of this al-fresco party; and in one of the most



<P>comfortable rooms in the Abbey, especially prepared for him by a



<P>fire all the morning, he was happily placed, quite at his ease,



<P>ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved, and advise



<P>every body to come and sit down, and not to heat themselves.--



<P>Mrs. Weston, who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired,



<P>and sit all the time with him, remained, when all the others



<P>were invited or persuaded out, his patient listener and sympathiser.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as she



<P>was satisfied of her father's comfort, she was glad to leave him,



<P>and look around her; eager to refresh and correct her memory with



<P>more particular observation, more exact understanding of a house



<P>and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance



<P>with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant,



<P>as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building,



<P>its suitable, becoming, characteristic situation, low and sheltered--



<P>its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream,



<P>of which the Abbey, with all the old neglect of prospect,



<P>had scarcely a sight--and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues,



<P>which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up.--The house



<P>was larger than Hartfield, and totally unlike it, covering a good



<P>deal of ground, rambling and irregular, with many comfortable,



<P>and one or two handsome rooms.--It was just what it ought to be,



<P>and it looked what it was--and Emma felt an increasing respect



<P>for it, as the residence of a family of such true gentility,



<P>untainted in blood and understanding.--Some faults of temper John



<P>Knightley had; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably.



<P>She had given them neither men, nor names, nor places, that could



<P>raise a blush.&nbsp; These were pleasant feelings, and she walked about



<P>and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did,



<P>and collect round the strawberry-beds.--The whole party were assembled,



<P>excepting Frank Churchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond;



<P>and Mrs. Elton, in all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet



<P>and her basket, was very ready to lead the way in gathering,



<P>accepting, or talking--strawberries, and only strawberries,



<P>could now be thought or spoken of.--"The best fruit in England--



<P>every body's favourite--always wholesome.--These the finest beds



<P>and finest sorts.--Delightful to gather for one's self--the only way



<P>of really enjoying them.--Morning decidedly the best time--never tired--



<P>every sort good--hautboy infinitely superior--no comparison--



<P>the others hardly eatable--hautboys very scarce--Chili preferred--



<P>white wood finest flavour of all--price of strawberries in London--



<P>abundance about Bristol--Maple Grove--cultivation--beds when to



<P>be renewed--gardeners thinking exactly different--no general rule--



<P>gardeners never to be put out of their way--delicious fruit--



<P>only too rich to be eaten much of--inferior to cherries--



<P>currants more refreshing--only objection to gathering strawberries



<P>the stooping--glaring sun--tired to death--could bear it no longer--



<P>must go and sit in the shade."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Such, for half an hour, was the conversation--interrupted only



<P>once by Mrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her



<P>son-in-law, to inquire if he were come--and she was a little uneasy.--



<P>She had some fears of his horse.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Seats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged



<P>to overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.--



<P>A situation, a most desirable situation, was in question.&nbsp; Mrs.

Elton



<P>had received notice of it that morning, and was in raptures.



<P>It was not with Mrs. Suckling, it was not with Mrs. Bragge,



<P>but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them:&nbsp; it was



<P>with a cousin of Mrs. Bragge, an acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling,



<P>a lady known at Maple Grove.&nbsp; Delightful, charming, superior,



<P>first circles, spheres, lines, ranks, every thing--and Mrs. Elton



<P>was wild to have the offer closed with immediately.--On her side,



<P>all was warmth, energy, and triumph--and she positively refused



<P>to take her friend's negative, though Miss Fairfax continued



<P>to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing,



<P>repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before.--



<P>Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence



<P>by the morrow's post.--How Jane could bear it at all, was astonishing



<P>to Emma.--She did look vexed, she did speak pointedly--and at last,



<P>with a decision of action unusual to her, proposed a removal.--



<P>"Should not they walk?&nbsp; Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the gardens--



<P>all the gardens?--She wished to see the whole extent."--The pertinacity



<P>of her friend seemed more than she could bear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered,



<P>dispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensibly



<P>followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short



<P>avenue of limes, which stretching beyond the garden at an equal



<P>distance from the river, seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds.--



<P>It led to nothing; nothing but a view at the end over a low stone



<P>wall with high pillars, which seemed intended, in their erection,



<P>to give the appearance of an approach to the house, which never had



<P>been there.&nbsp; Disputable, however, as might be the taste of such



<P>a termination, it was in itself a charming walk, and the view



<P>which closed it extremely pretty.--The considerable slope, at nearly



<P>the foot of which the Abbey stood, gradually acquired a steeper



<P>form beyond its grounds; and at half a mile distant was a bank



<P>of considerable abruptness and grandeur, well clothed with wood;--



<P>and at the bottom of this bank, favourably placed and sheltered,



<P>rose the Abbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the river



<P>making a close and handsome curve around it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was a sweet view--sweet to the eye and the mind.&nbsp; English verdure,



<P>English culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright,



<P>without being oppressive.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled;



<P>and towards this view she immediately perceived Mr. Knightley



<P>and Harriet distinct from the rest, quietly leading the way.



<P>Mr. Knightley and Harriet!--It was an odd tete-a-tete; but she was



<P>glad to see it.--There had been a time when he would have scorned



<P>her as a companion, and turned from her with little ceremony.



<P>Now they seemed in pleasant conversation.&nbsp; There had been a time



<P>also when Emma would have been sorry to see Harriet in a spot



<P>so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm; but now she feared it not.



<P>It might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity



<P>and beauty, its rich pastures, spreading flocks, orchard in blossom,



<P>and light column of smoke ascending.--She joined them at the wall,



<P>and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around.



<P>He was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture, etc.



<P>and Emma received a smile which seemed to say, "These are my



<P>own concerns.&nbsp; I have a right to talk on such subjects, without

being



<P>suspected of introducing Robert Martin."--She did not suspect him.



<P>It was too old a story.--Robert Martin had probably ceased to think



<P>of Harriet.--They took a few turns together along the walk.--The shade



<P>was most refreshing, and Emma found it the pleasantest part of



<P>the day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;--



<P>and they were all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did



<P>not come.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston looked, and looked in vain.&nbsp; His father

would



<P>not own himself uneasy, and laughed at her fears; but she could



<P>not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare.



<P>He had expressed himself as to coming, with more than common certainty.



<P>"His aunt was so much better, that he had not a doubt of getting



<P>over to them."--Mrs. Churchill's state, however, as many were ready



<P>to remind her, was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint



<P>her nephew in the most reasonable dependence--and Mrs. Weston



<P>was at last persuaded to believe, or to say, that it must be



<P>by some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he was prevented coming.--



<P>Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration;



<P>she behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more



<P>to see what had not yet been seen, the old Abbey fish-ponds;



<P>perhaps get as far as the clover, which was to be begun cutting



<P>on the morrow, or, at any rate, have the pleasure of being hot,



<P>and growing cool again.--Mr. Woodhouse, who had already taken



<P>his little round in the highest part of the gardens, where no



<P>damps from the river were imagined even by him, stirred no more;



<P>and his daughter resolved to remain with him, that Mrs. Weston



<P>might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety



<P>which her spirits seemed to need.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Knightley had done all in his power for Mr. Woodhouse's



<P>entertainment.&nbsp; Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos,



<P>corals, shells, and every other family collection within his cabinets,



<P>had been prepared for his old friend, to while away the morning;



<P>and the kindness had perfectly answered.&nbsp; Mr. Woodhouse had been



<P>exceedingly well amused.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all

to him,



<P>and now he would shew them all to Emma;--fortunate in having no other



<P>resemblance to a child, than in a total want of taste for what he saw,



<P>for he was slow, constant, and methodical.--Before this second looking



<P>over was begun, however, Emma walked into the hall for the sake



<P>of a few moments' free observation of the entrance and ground-plot



<P>of the house--and was hardly there, when Jane Fairfax appeared,



<P>coming quickly in from the garden, and with a look of escape.--



<P>Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon, there was a start



<P>at first; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Will you be so kind," said she, "when I am missed, as to say



<P>that I am gone home?--I am going this moment.--My aunt is not aware



<P>how late it is, nor how long we have been absent--but I am sure we



<P>shall be wanted, and I am determined to go directly.--I have said



<P>nothing about it to any body.&nbsp; It would only be giving trouble



<P>and distress.&nbsp; Some are gone to the ponds, and some to the lime

walk.



<P>Till they all come in I shall not be missed; and when they do,



<P>will you have the goodness to say that I am gone?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Certainly, if you wish it;--but you are not going to walk



<P>to Highbury alone?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes--what should hurt me?--I walk fast.&nbsp; I shall be at home



<P>in twenty minutes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone.



<P>Let my father's servant go with you.--Let me order the carriage.



<P>It can be round in five minutes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you, thank you--but on no account.--I would rather walk.--



<P>And for me to be afraid of walking alone!--I, who may so soon have



<P>to guard others!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied,



<P>"That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now.



<P>I must order the carriage.&nbsp; The heat even would be danger.--You

are



<P>fatigued already."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am,"--she answered--"I am fatigued; but it is not the sort



<P>of fatigue--quick walking will refresh me.--Miss Woodhouse, we all



<P>know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits.&nbsp; Mine, I confess,



<P>are exhausted.&nbsp; The greatest kindness you can shew me, will be

to let



<P>me have my own way, and only say that I am gone when it is necessary."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma had not another word to oppose.&nbsp; She saw it all; and entering



<P>into her feelings, promoted her quitting the house immediately,



<P>and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend.&nbsp; Her parting



<P>look was grateful--and her parting words, "Oh!&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse,



<P>the comfort of being sometimes alone!"--seemed to burst from



<P>an overcharged heart, and to describe somewhat of the continual



<P>endurance to be practised by her, even towards some of those who



<P>loved her best.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Such a home, indeed! such an aunt!" said Emma, as she turned back



<P>into the hall again.&nbsp; "I do pity you.&nbsp; And the more sensibility



<P>you betray of their just horrors, the more I shall like you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had only



<P>accomplished some views of St. Mark's Place, Venice, when Frank



<P>Churchill entered the room.&nbsp; Emma had not been thinking of him,



<P>she had forgotten to think of him--but she was very glad to see him.



<P>Mrs. Weston would be at ease.&nbsp; The black mare was blameless;



<P>they were right who had named Mrs. Churchill as the cause.



<P>He had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her;



<P>a nervous seizure, which had lasted some hours--and he had quite given



<P>up every thought of coming, till very late;--and had he known how hot



<P>a ride he should have, and how late, with all his hurry, he must be,



<P>he believed he should not have come at all.&nbsp; The heat was excessive;



<P>he had never suffered any thing like it--almost wished he had staid



<P>at home--nothing killed him like heat--he could bear any degree of cold,



<P>etc., but heat was intolerable--and he sat down, at the greatest



<P>possible distance from the slight remains of Mr. Woodhouse's fire,



<P>looking very deplorable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You will soon be cooler, if you sit still," said Emma.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again.&nbsp; I could very



<P>ill be spared--but such a point had been made of my coming!



<P>You will all be going soon I suppose; the whole party breaking up.



<P>I met one as I came--Madness in such weather!--absolute madness!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill's



<P>state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being



<P>out of humour.&nbsp; Some people were always cross when they were hot.



<P>Such might be his constitution; and as she knew that eating



<P>and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints,



<P>she recommended his taking some refreshment; he would find abundance



<P>of every thing in the dining-room--and she humanely pointed out



<P>the door.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No--he should not eat.&nbsp; He was not hungry; it would only make



<P>him hotter."&nbsp; In two minutes, however, he relented in his own favour;



<P>and muttering something about spruce-beer, walked off.&nbsp; Emma returned



<P>all her attention to her father, saying in secret--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am glad I have done being in love with him.&nbsp; I should not like

a



<P>man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning.&nbsp; Harriet's sweet



<P>easy temper will not mind it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, and came



<P>back all the better--grown quite cool--and, with good manners,



<P>like himself--able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest



<P>in their employment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he



<P>should be so late.&nbsp; He was not in his best spirits, but seemed



<P>trying to improve them; and, at last, made himself talk nonsense



<P>very agreeably.&nbsp; They were looking over views in Swisserland.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad," said he.



<P>"I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places.



<P>You will have my sketches, some time or other, to look at--or my tour



<P>to read--or my poem.&nbsp; I shall do something to expose myself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That may be--but not by sketches in Swisserland.&nbsp; You will



<P>never go to Swisserland.&nbsp; Your uncle and aunt will never allow



<P>you to leave England."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They may be induced to go too.&nbsp; A warm climate may be prescribed



<P>for her.&nbsp; I have more than half an expectation of our all going

abroad.



<P>I assure you I have.&nbsp; I feel a strong persuasion, this morning,



<P>that I shall soon be abroad.&nbsp; I ought to travel.&nbsp; I am tired



<P>of doing nothing.&nbsp; I want a change.&nbsp; I am serious, Miss Woodhouse,



<P>whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy--I am sick of England--



<P>and would leave it to-morrow, if I could."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are sick of prosperity and indulgence.&nbsp; Cannot you invent



<P>a few hardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I sick of prosperity and indulgence!&nbsp; You are quite mistaken.



<P>I do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged.&nbsp; I

am



<P>thwarted in every thing material.&nbsp; I do not consider myself at

all



<P>a fortunate person."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came.



<P>Go and eat and drink a little more, and you will do very well.



<P>Another slice of cold meat, another draught of Madeira and water,



<P>will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No--I shall not stir.&nbsp; I shall sit by you.&nbsp; You are my best

cure."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We are going to Box Hill to-morrow;--you will join us.



<P>It is not Swisserland, but it will be something for a young



<P>man so much in want of a change.&nbsp; You will stay, and go with us?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No--It will not be worth while.&nbsp; If I come, I shall be cross."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then pray stay at Richmond."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But if I do, I shall be crosser still.&nbsp; I can never bear to think



<P>of you all there without me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself.



<P>Chuse your own degree of crossness.&nbsp; I shall press you no more."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The rest of the party were now returning, and all were soon collected.



<P>With some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill;



<P>others took it very composedly; but there was a very general distress



<P>and disturbance on Miss Fairfax's disappearance being explained.



<P>That it was time for every body to go, concluded the subject; and with



<P>a short final arrangement for the next day's scheme, they parted.



<P>Frank Churchill's little inclination to exclude himself increased



<P>so much, that his last words to Emma were,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well;--if you wish me to stay and join the party, I will."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She smiled her acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from



<P>Richmond was to take him back before the following evening.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Till now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known



<P>how much of her happiness depended on being first with Mr. Knightley,



<P>first in interest and affection.--Satisfied that it was so,



<P>and feeling it her due, she had enjoyed it without reflection;



<P>and only in the dread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly



<P>important it had been.--Long, very long, she felt she had been first;



<P>for, having no female connexions of his own, there had been



<P>only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers, and she



<P>had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella.



<P>She had herself been first with him for many years past.



<P>She had not deserved it; she had often been negligent or perverse,



<P>slighting his advice, or even wilfully opposing him, insensible of



<P>half his merits, and quarrelling with him because he would not



<P>acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own--but still,



<P>from family attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of mind,



<P>he had loved her, and watched over her from a girl, with an endeavour



<P>to improve her, and an anxiety for her doing right, which no



<P>other creature had at all shared.&nbsp; In spite of all her faults,



<P>she knew she was dear to him; might she not say, very dear?--



<P>When the suggestions of hope, however, which must follow here,



<P>presented themselves, she could not presume to indulge them.



<P>Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly,



<P>exclusively, passionately loved by Mr. Knightley.&nbsp; She could not.



<P>She could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment



<P>to her.&nbsp; She had received a very recent proof of its impartiality.--



<P>How shocked had he been by her behaviour to Miss Bates!&nbsp; How directly,



<P>how strongly had he expressed himself to her on the subject!--Not too



<P>strongly for the offence--but far, far too strongly to issue from



<P>any feeling softer than upright justice and clear-sighted goodwill.--



<P>She had no hope, nothing to deserve the name of hope, that he could



<P>have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question;



<P>but there was a hope (at times a slight one, at times much stronger,)



<P>that Harriet might have deceived herself, and be overrating his



<P>regard for her.--Wish it she must, for his sake--be the consequence



<P>nothing to herself, but his remaining single all his life.



<P>Could she be secure of that, indeed, of his never marrying at all,



<P>she believed she should be perfectly satisfied.--Let him but continue



<P>the same Mr. Knightley to her and her father, the same Mr. Knightley



<P>to all the world; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their



<P>precious intercourse of friendship and confidence, and her peace



<P>would be fully secured.--Marriage, in fact, would not do for her.



<P>It would be incompatible with what she owed to her father, and with



<P>what she felt for him.&nbsp; Nothing should separate her from her father.



<P>She would not marry, even if she were asked by Mr. Knightley.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed;



<P>and she hoped, that when able to see them together again, she might

at



<P>least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She should



<P>see them henceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly



<P>as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching,



<P>she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here.--



<P>He was expected back every day.&nbsp; The power of observation would

be



<P>soon given--frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in



<P>one course.&nbsp; In the meanwhile, she resolved against seeing Harriet.--



<P>It would do neither of them good, it would do the subject no good,



<P>to be talking of it farther.--She was resolved not to be convinced,



<P>as long as she could doubt, and yet had no authority for opposing



<P>Harriet's confidence.&nbsp; To talk would be only to irritate.--She

wrote



<P>to her, therefore, kindly, but decisively, to beg that she would not,



<P>at present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it to be her conviction,



<P>that all farther confidential discussion of one topic had better



<P>be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were allowed to pass before



<P>they met again, except in the company of others--she objected only



<P>to a tete-a-tete--they might be able to act as if they had forgotten



<P>the conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted, and approved,



<P>and was grateful.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma's



<P>thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them,



<P>sleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours--Mrs. Weston, who had



<P>been calling on her daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in her



<P>way home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself,



<P>to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Weston had accompanied her to Mrs. Bates's, and gone through his



<P>share of this essential attention most handsomely; but she having



<P>then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing, was now returned



<P>with much more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction,



<P>than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates's parlour, with all



<P>the encumbrance of awkward feelings, could have afforded.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A little curiosity Emma had; and she made the most of it while



<P>her friend related.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit



<P>in a good deal of agitation herself; and in the first place had



<P>wished not to go at all at present, to be allowed merely to write



<P>to Miss Fairfax instead, and to defer this ceremonious call till



<P>a little time had passed, and Mr. Churchill could be reconciled



<P>to the engagement's becoming known; as, considering every thing,



<P>she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports:--



<P>but Mr. Weston had thought differently; he was extremely anxious



<P>to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her family, and did not



<P>conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it; or if it were,



<P>that it would be of any consequence; for "such things," he observed,



<P>"always got about."&nbsp; Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston had



<P>very good reason for saying so.&nbsp; They had gone, in short--and very



<P>great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady.



<P>She had hardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action



<P>had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness.&nbsp; The

quiet,



<P>heart-felt satisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight



<P>of her daughter--who proved even too joyous to talk as usual,



<P>had been a gratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene.&nbsp; They were



<P>both so truly respectable in their happiness, so disinterested



<P>in every sensation; thought so much of Jane; so much of every body,



<P>and so little of themselves, that every kindly feeling was at work



<P>for them.&nbsp; Miss Fairfax's recent illness had offered a fair plea



<P>for Mrs. Weston to invite her to an airing; she had drawn back and



<P>declined at first, but, on being pressed had yielded; and, in the



<P>course of their drive, Mrs. Weston had, by gentle encouragement,



<P>overcome so much of her embarrassment, as to bring her to converse



<P>on the important subject.&nbsp; Apologies for her seemingly ungracious



<P>silence in their first reception, and the warmest expressions of the



<P>gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and Mr. Weston,



<P>must necessarily open the cause; but when these effusions were put by,



<P>they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state



<P>of the engagement.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston was convinced that such conversation



<P>must be the greatest relief to her companion, pent up within her own



<P>mind as every thing had so long been, and was very much pleased



<P>with all that she had said on the subject.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"On the misery of what she had suffered, during the concealment



<P>of so many months," continued Mrs. Weston, "she was energetic.



<P>This was one of her expressions.&nbsp; `I will not say, that since I



<P>entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments; but I



<P>can say, that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:'--



<P>and the quivering lip, Emma, which uttered it, was an attestation



<P>that I felt at my heart."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Poor girl!" said Emma.&nbsp; "She thinks herself wrong, then, for having



<P>consented to a private engagement?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Wrong!&nbsp; No one, I believe, can blame her more than she is disposed



<P>to blame herself.&nbsp; `The consequence,' said she, `has been a state



<P>of perpetual suffering to me; and so it ought.&nbsp; But after all the



<P>punishment that misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct.



<P>Pain is no expiation.&nbsp; I never can be blameless.&nbsp; I have been

acting



<P>contrary to all my sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every



<P>thing has taken, and the kindness I am now receiving, is what my



<P>conscience tells me ought not to be.'&nbsp; `Do not imagine, madam,'



<P>she continued, `that I was taught wrong.&nbsp; Do not let any reflection



<P>fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought



<P>me up.&nbsp; The error has been all my own; and I do assure you that,



<P>with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give,



<P>I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell.'"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Poor girl!" said Emma again.&nbsp; "She loves him then excessively,



<P>I suppose.&nbsp; It must have been from attachment only, that she could



<P>be led to form the engagement.&nbsp; Her affection must have overpowered



<P>her judgment."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am afraid," returned Emma, sighing, "that I must often have



<P>contributed to make her unhappy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"On your side, my love, it was very innocently done.&nbsp; But she



<P>probably had something of that in her thoughts, when alluding



<P>to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before.



<P>One natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in,"



<P>she said, "was that of making her unreasonable.&nbsp; The consciousness



<P>of having done amiss, had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes,



<P>and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been--



<P>that had been--hard for him to bear.&nbsp; `I did not make the allowances,'



<P>said she, `which I ought to have done, for his temper and spirits--



<P>his delightful spirits, and that gaiety, that playfulness



<P>of disposition, which, under any other circumstances, would, I am sure,



<P>have been as constantly bewitching to me, as they were at first.'



<P>She then began to speak of you, and of the great kindness you



<P>had shewn her during her illness; and with a blush which shewed me



<P>how it was all connected, desired me, whenever I had an opportunity,



<P>to thank you--I could not thank you too much--for every wish and



<P>every endeavour to do her good.&nbsp; She was sensible that you had

never



<P>received any proper acknowledgment from herself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If I did not know her to be happy now," said Emma, seriously,



<P>"which, in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous



<P>conscience, she must be, I could not bear these thanks;--for, oh!



<P>Mrs. Weston, if there were an account drawn up of the evil



<P>and the good I have done Miss Fairfax!--Well (checking herself,



<P>and trying to be more lively), this is all to be forgotten.



<P>You are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars.



<P>They shew her to the greatest advantage.&nbsp; I am sure she is very

good--



<P>I hope she will be very happy.&nbsp; It is fit that the fortune



<P>should be on his side, for I think the merit will be all on hers."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston.



<P>She thought well of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more,



<P>she loved him very much, and her defence was, therefore, earnest.



<P>She talked with a great deal of reason, and at least equal affection--



<P>but she had too much to urge for Emma's attention; it was soon gone



<P>to Brunswick Square or to Donwell; she forgot to attempt to listen;



<P>and when Mrs. Weston ended with, "We have not yet had the letter



<P>we are so anxious for, you know, but I hope it will soon come,"



<P>she was obliged to pause before she answered, and at last obliged



<P>to answer at random, before she could at all recollect what letter it



<P>was which they were so anxious for.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Are you well, my Emma?" was Mrs. Weston's parting question.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! perfectly.&nbsp; I am always well, you know.&nbsp; Be sure to give

me



<P>intelligence of the letter as soon as possible."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Weston's communications furnished Emma with more food for



<P>unpleasant reflection, by increasing her esteem and compassion,



<P>and her sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax.&nbsp; She bitterly



<P>regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her, and blushed



<P>for the envious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure,



<P>the cause.&nbsp; Had she followed Mr. Knightley's known wishes, in paying



<P>that attention to Miss Fairfax, which was every way her due; had she



<P>tried to know her better; had she done her part towards intimacy;



<P>had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith;



<P>she must, in all probability, have been spared from every pain



<P>which pressed on her now.--Birth, abilities, and education,



<P>had been equally marking one as an associate for her, to be received



<P>with gratitude; and the other--what was she?--Supposing even that



<P>they had never become intimate friends; that she had never been



<P>admitted into Miss Fairfax's confidence on this important matter--



<P>which was most probable--still, in knowing her as she ought,



<P>and as she might, she must have been preserved from the abominable



<P>suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had



<P>not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so



<P>unpardonably imparted; an idea which she greatly feared had been made



<P>a subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane's feelings,



<P>by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill's.&nbsp; Of all the

sources



<P>of evil surrounding the former, since her coming to Highbury,



<P>she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst.



<P>She must have been a perpetual enemy.&nbsp; They never could have been



<P>all three together, without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax's peace



<P>in a thousand instances; and on Box Hill, perhaps, it had been



<P>the agony of a mind that would bear no more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield.



<P>The weather added what it could of gloom.&nbsp; A cold stormy rain set

in,



<P>and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the



<P>wind was despoiling, and the length of the day, which only made



<P>such cruel sights the longer visible.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he could only be kept tolerably



<P>comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his daughter's side,



<P>and by exertions which had never cost her half so much before.



<P>It reminded her of their first forlorn tete-a-tete, on the evening



<P>of Mrs. Weston's wedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked



<P>in then, soon after tea, and dissipated every melancholy fancy.



<P>Alas! such delightful proofs of Hartfield's attraction, as those



<P>sort of visits conveyed, might shortly be over.&nbsp; The picture which



<P>she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter,



<P>had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them, no pleasures



<P>had been lost.--But her present forebodings she feared would



<P>experience no similar contradiction.&nbsp; The prospect before her now,



<P>was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled--



<P>that might not be even partially brightened.&nbsp; If all took place



<P>that might take place among the circle of her friends, Hartfield must



<P>be comparatively deserted; and she left to cheer her father with the



<P>spirits only of ruined happiness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer



<P>than herself; and Mrs. Weston's heart and time would be occupied



<P>by it.&nbsp; They should lose her; and, probably, in great measure,



<P>her husband also.--Frank Churchill would return among them no more;



<P>and Miss Fairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease



<P>to belong to Highbury.&nbsp; They would be married, and settled either



<P>at or near Enscombe.&nbsp; All that were good would be withdrawn; and

if



<P>to these losses, the loss of Donwell were to be added, what would



<P>remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach?



<P>Mr. Knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort!--



<P>No longer walking in at all hours, as if ever willing to change



<P>his own home for their's!--How was it to be endured?&nbsp; And if he

were



<P>to be lost to them for Harriet's sake; if he were to be thought



<P>of hereafter, as finding in Harriet's society all that he wanted;



<P>if Harriet were to be the chosen, the first, the dearest, the friend,



<P>the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence;



<P>what could be increasing Emma's wretchedness but the reflection never

far



<P>distant from her mind, that it had been all her own work?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When it came to such a pitch as this, she was not able to refrain



<P>from a start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room



<P>for a few seconds--and the only source whence any thing like consolation



<P>or composure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her own



<P>better conduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and



<P>gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life



<P>to the past, it would yet find her more rational, more acquainted



<P>with herself, and leave her less to regret when it were gone.

<B>CHAPTER VIII</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>The wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma's thoughts all



<P>the evening.&nbsp; How it might be considered by the rest of the party,



<P>she could not tell.&nbsp; They, in their different homes, and their

different



<P>ways, might be looking back on it with pleasure; but in her view it



<P>was a morning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rational



<P>satisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection,



<P>than any she had ever passed.&nbsp; A whole evening of back-gammon with



<P>her father, was felicity to it.&nbsp; There, indeed, lay real pleasure,



<P>for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four



<P>to his comfort; and feeling that, unmerited as might be the degree



<P>of his fond affection and confiding esteem, she could not, in her



<P>general conduct, be open to any severe reproach.&nbsp; As a daughter,



<P>she hoped she was not without a heart.&nbsp; She hoped no one could



<P>have said to her, "How could you be so unfeeling to your father?--



<P>I must, I will tell you truths while I can."&nbsp; Miss Bates should



<P>never again--no, never!&nbsp; If attention, in future, could do away



<P>the past, she might hope to be forgiven.&nbsp; She had been often remiss,



<P>her conscience told her so; remiss, perhaps, more in thought



<P>than fact; scornful, ungracious.&nbsp; But it should be so no more.



<P>In the warmth of true contrition, she would call upon her the



<P>very next morning, and it should be the beginning, on her side,



<P>of a regular, equal, kindly intercourse.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early,



<P>that nothing might prevent her.&nbsp; It was not unlikely, she thought,



<P>that she might see Mr. Knightley in her way; or, perhaps, he might



<P>come in while she were paying her visit.&nbsp; She had no objection.



<P>She would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence, so justly



<P>and truly hers.&nbsp; Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked, but

she



<P>saw him not.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The ladies were all at home."&nbsp; She had never rejoiced at the sound



<P>before, nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked up the stairs,



<P>with any wish of giving pleasure, but in conferring obligation,



<P>or of deriving it, except in subsequent ridicule.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a bustle on her approach; a good deal of moving and talking.



<P>She heard Miss Bates's voice, something was to be done in a hurry;



<P>the maid looked frightened and awkward; hoped she would be pleased



<P>to wait a moment, and then ushered her in too soon.&nbsp; The aunt and



<P>niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room.&nbsp; Jane she had



<P>a distinct glimpse of, looking extremely ill; and, before the door



<P>had shut them out, she heard Miss Bates saying, "Well, my dear,



<P>I shall say you are laid down upon the bed, and I am sure you are



<P>ill enough."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Poor old Mrs. Bates, civil and humble as usual, looked as if she



<P>did not quite understand what was going on.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am afraid Jane is not very well," said she, "but I do not know;



<P>they tell me she is well.&nbsp; I dare say my daughter will be here

presently,



<P>Miss Woodhouse.&nbsp; I hope you find a chair.&nbsp; I wish Hetty had

not gone.



<P>I am very little able--Have you a chair, ma'am? Do you sit where



<P>you like?&nbsp; I am sure she will be here presently."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma seriously hoped she would.&nbsp; She had a moment's fear of Miss



<P>Bates keeping away from her.&nbsp; But Miss Bates soon came--"Very happy



<P>and obliged"--but Emma's conscience told her that there was not the



<P>same cheerful volubility as before--less ease of look and manner.



<P>A very friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she hoped, might lead



<P>the way to a return of old feelings.&nbsp; The touch seemed immediate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah!&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!--I suppose you have heard--



<P>and are come to give us joy.&nbsp; This does not seem much like joy,



<P>indeed, in me--(twinkling away a tear or two)--but it will be



<P>very trying for us to part with her, after having had her so long,



<P>and she has a dreadful headach just now, writing all the morning:--



<P>such long letters, you know, to be written to Colonel Campbell,



<P>and Mrs. Dixon.&nbsp; `My dear,' said I, `you will blind yourself'--



<P>for tears were in her eyes perpetually.&nbsp; One cannot wonder,



<P>one cannot wonder.&nbsp; It is a great change; and though she is



<P>amazingly fortunate--such a situation, I suppose, as no young woman



<P>before ever met with on first going out--do not think us ungrateful,



<P>Miss Woodhouse, for such surprising good fortune--(again dispersing



<P>her tears)--but, poor dear soul! if you were to see what a headache



<P>she has.&nbsp; When one is in great pain, you know one cannot feel



<P>any blessing quite as it may deserve.&nbsp; She is as low as possible.



<P>To look at her, nobody would think how delighted and happy she



<P>is to have secured such a situation.&nbsp; You will excuse her not



<P>coming to you--she is not able--she is gone into her own room--



<P>I want her to lie down upon the bed.&nbsp; `My dear,' said I, `I shall



<P>say you are laid down upon the bed:'&nbsp; but, however, she is not;



<P>she is walking about the room.&nbsp; But, now that she has written



<P>her letters, she says she shall soon be well.&nbsp; She will be extremely



<P>sorry to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse, but your kindness will



<P>excuse her.&nbsp; You were kept waiting at the door--I was quite ashamed--



<P>but somehow there was a little bustle--for it so happened that we



<P>had not heard the knock, and till you were on the stairs, we did



<P>not know any body was coming.&nbsp; `It is only Mrs. Cole,' said I,



<P>`depend upon it.&nbsp; Nobody else would come so early.'&nbsp; `Well,'

said she,



<P>`it must be borne some time or other, and it may as well be now.'



<P>But then Patty came in, and said it was you.&nbsp; `Oh!' said I,



<P>`it is Miss Woodhouse:&nbsp; I am sure you will like to see her.'--



<P>`I can see nobody,' said she; and up she got, and would go away;



<P>and that was what made us keep you waiting--and extremely sorry



<P>and ashamed we were.&nbsp; `If you must go, my dear,' said I, `you must,



<P>and I will say you are laid down upon the bed.'"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma was most sincerely interested.&nbsp; Her heart had been long growing



<P>kinder towards Jane; and this picture of her present sufferings acted



<P>as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left her nothing



<P>but pity; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle



<P>sensations of the past, obliged her to admit that Jane might very



<P>naturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend,



<P>when she might not bear to see herself.&nbsp; She spoke as she felt,



<P>with earnest regret and solicitude--sincerely wishing that the



<P>circumstances which she collected from Miss Bates to be now actually



<P>determined on, might be as much for Miss Fairfax's advantage



<P>and comfort as possible.&nbsp; "It must be a severe trial to them all.



<P>She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell's return."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So very kind! " replied Miss Bates.&nbsp; "But you are always kind."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was no bearing such an "always;" and to break through her



<P>dreadful gratitude, Emma made the direct inquiry of--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Where--may I ask?--is Miss Fairfax going?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To a Mrs. Smallridge--charming woman--most superior--to have



<P>the charge of her three little girls--delightful children.



<P>Impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort;



<P>if we except, perhaps, Mrs. Suckling's own family, and Mrs. Bragge's;



<P>but Mrs. Smallridge is intimate with both, and in the very



<P>same neighbourhood:--lives only four miles from Maple Grove.



<P>Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mrs. Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, our good Mrs. Elton.&nbsp; The most indefatigable, true friend.



<P>She would not take a denial.&nbsp; She would not let Jane say, `No;'

for



<P>when Jane first heard of it, (it was the day before yesterday,



<P>the very morning we were at Donwell,) when Jane first heard of it,



<P>she was quite decided against accepting the offer, and for the



<P>reasons you mention; exactly as you say, she had made up her mind



<P>to close with nothing till Colonel Campbell's return, and nothing



<P>should induce her to enter into any engagement at present--and so she



<P>told Mrs. Elton over and over again--and I am sure I had no more



<P>idea that she would change her mind!--but that good Mrs. Elton,



<P>whose judgment never fails her, saw farther than I did.&nbsp; It is

not



<P>every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did,



<P>and refuse to take Jane's answer; but she positively declared she



<P>would not write any such denial yesterday, as Jane wished her;



<P>she would wait--and, sure enough, yesterday evening it was all



<P>settled that Jane should go.&nbsp; Quite a surprize to me!&nbsp; I had

not



<P>the least idea!--Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her at once,



<P>that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge's situation,



<P>she had come to the resolution of accepting it.--I did not know a word



<P>of it till it was all settled."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come.&nbsp; It was settled

so,



<P>upon the hill, while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley.



<P>`You must all spend your evening with us,' said she--`I positively must



<P>have you all come.'"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr. Knightley was there too, was he?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, not Mr. Knightley; he declined it from the first; and though I



<P>thought he would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she would not let



<P>him off, he did not;--but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there,



<P>and a very agreeable evening we had.&nbsp; Such kind friends, you know,



<P>Miss Woodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body



<P>seemed rather fagged after the morning's party.&nbsp; Even pleasure,



<P>you know, is fatiguing--and I cannot say that any of them seemed



<P>very much to have enjoyed it.&nbsp; However, I shall always think it



<P>a very pleasant party, and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends



<P>who included me in it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had been



<P>making up her mind the whole day?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I dare say she had."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Whenever the time may come, it must be unwelcome to her and all



<P>her friends--but I hope her engagement will have every alleviation



<P>that is possible--I mean, as to the character and manners of the family."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse.&nbsp; Yes, indeed, there is every thing



<P>in the world that can make her happy in it.&nbsp; Except the Sucklings



<P>and Bragges, there is not such another nursery establishment,



<P>so liberal and elegant, in all Mrs. Elton's acquaintance.



<P>Mrs. Smallridge, a most delightful woman!--A style of living almost



<P>equal to Maple Grove--and as to the children, except the little



<P>Sucklings and little Bragges, there are not such elegant sweet



<P>children anywhere.&nbsp; Jane will be treated with such regard and kindness!--



<P>It will be nothing but pleasure, a life of pleasure.--And her salary!--



<P>I really cannot venture to name her salary to you, Miss Woodhouse.



<P>Even you, used as you are to great sums, would hardly believe that



<P>so much could be given to a young person like Jane."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! madam," cried Emma, "if other children are at all like what I



<P>remember to have been myself, I should think five times the amount



<P>of what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions,



<P>dearly earned."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are so noble in your ideas!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very soon, very soon, indeed; that's the worst of it.



<P>Within a fortnight.&nbsp; Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry.&nbsp;

My poor



<P>mother does not know how to bear it.&nbsp; So then, I try to put it

out of



<P>her thoughts, and say, Come ma'am, do not let us think about it any

more."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Her friends must all be sorry to lose her; and will not Colonel



<P>and Mrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself



<P>before their return?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes; Jane says she is sure they will; but yet, this is such



<P>a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining.



<P>I was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying



<P>to Mrs. Elton, and when Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating



<P>me upon it!&nbsp; It was before tea--stay--no, it could not be before

tea,



<P>because we were just going to cards--and yet it was before tea,



<P>because I remember thinking--Oh! no, now I recollect, now I have it;



<P>something happened before tea, but not that.&nbsp; Mr. Elton was called



<P>out of the room before tea, old John Abdy's son wanted to speak



<P>with him.&nbsp; Poor old John, I have a great regard for him; he was

clerk



<P>to my poor father twenty-seven years; and now, poor old man, he is



<P>bed-ridden, and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his joints--



<P>I must go and see him to-day; and so will Jane, I am sure, if she



<P>gets out at all.&nbsp; And poor John's son came to talk to Mr. Elton



<P>about relief from the parish; he is very well to do himself,



<P>you know, being head man at the Crown, ostler, and every thing



<P>of that sort, but still he cannot keep his father without some help;



<P>and so, when Mr. Elton came back, he told us what John ostler



<P>had been telling him, and then it came out about the chaise having



<P>been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond.



<P>That was what happened before tea.&nbsp; It was after tea that Jane

spoke



<P>to Mrs. Elton."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly



<P>new this circumstance was to her; but as without supposing it



<P>possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars



<P>of Mr. Frank Churchill's going, she proceeded to give them all,



<P>it was of no consequence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the



<P>accumulation of the ostler's own knowledge, and the knowledge



<P>of the servants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over



<P>from Richmond soon after the return of the party from Box Hill--



<P>which messenger, however, had been no more than was expected;



<P>and that Mr. Churchill had sent his nephew a few lines, containing,



<P>upon the whole, a tolerable account of Mrs. Churchill, and only



<P>wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early;



<P>but that Mr. Frank Churchill having resolved to go home directly,



<P>without waiting at all, and his horse seeming to have got a cold,



<P>Tom had been sent off immediately for the Crown chaise, and the



<P>ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy going a good pace,



<P>and driving very steady.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest,



<P>and it caught Emma's attention only as it united with the subject



<P>which already engaged her mind.&nbsp; The contrast between Mrs. Churchill's



<P>importance in the world, and Jane Fairfax's, struck her; one was



<P>every thing, the other nothing--and she sat musing on the difference



<P>of woman's destiny, and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed,



<P>till roused by Miss Bates's saying,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte.&nbsp; What is

to become



<P>of that?--Very true.&nbsp; Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.--



<P>`You must go,' said she.&nbsp; `You and I must part.&nbsp; You will

have no



<P>business here.--Let it stay, however,' said she; `give it houseroom



<P>till Colonel Campbell comes back.&nbsp; I shall talk about it to him;



<P>he will settle for me; he will help me out of all my difficulties.'--



<P>And to this day, I do believe, she knows not whether it was his



<P>present or his daughter's."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembrance



<P>of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing,



<P>that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been



<P>long enough; and, with a repetition of every thing that she could



<P>venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt, took leave.

<B>CHAPTER IX</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Emma's pensive meditations, as she walked home, were not interrupted;



<P>but on entering the parlour, she found those who must rouse her.



<P>Mr. Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence, and were



<P>sitting with her father.--Mr. Knightley immediately got up, and in a



<P>manner decidedly graver than usual, said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare,



<P>and therefore must now be gone directly.&nbsp; I am going to London,



<P>to spend a few days with John and Isabella.&nbsp; Have you any thing

to



<P>send or say, besides the `love,' which nobody carries?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nothing at all.&nbsp; But is not this a sudden scheme?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes--rather--I have been thinking of it some little time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself.



<P>Time, however, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be



<P>friends again.&nbsp; While he stood, as if meaning to go, but not going--



<P>her father began his inquiries.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?--And how did you



<P>find my worthy old friend and her daughter?--I dare say they must



<P>have been very much obliged to you for coming.&nbsp; Dear Emma has been



<P>to call on Mrs. and Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you before.



<P>She is always so attentive to them!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma's colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with a smile,



<P>and shake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at Mr. Knightley.--



<P>It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour,



<P>as if his eyes received the truth from her's, and all that had



<P>passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.--



<P>He looked at her with a glow of regard.&nbsp; She was warmly gratified--



<P>and in another moment still more so, by a little movement of



<P>more than common friendliness on his part.--He took her hand;--



<P>whether she had not herself made the first motion, she could not say--



<P>she might, perhaps, have rather offered it--but he took her hand,



<P>pressed it, and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips--



<P>when, from some fancy or other, he suddenly let it go.--Why he should

feel



<P>such a scruple, why he should change his mind when it was all but done,



<P>she could not perceive.--He would have judged better, she thought,



<P>if he had not stopped.--The intention, however, was indubitable;



<P>and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry,



<P>or however else it happened, but she thought nothing became him more.--



<P>It was with him, of so simple, yet so dignified a nature.--



<P>She could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction.



<P>It spoke such perfect amity.--He left them immediately afterwards--



<P>gone in a moment.&nbsp; He always moved with the alertness of a mind

which



<P>could neither be undecided nor dilatory, but now he seemed more sudden



<P>than usual in his disappearance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates, but she wished



<P>she had left her ten minutes earlier;--it would have been a great



<P>pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax's situation with Mr. Knightley.--



<P>Neither would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square,



<P>for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed--but it might have



<P>happened at a better time--and to have had longer notice of it,



<P>would have been pleasanter.--They parted thorough friends, however;



<P>she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance,



<P>and his unfinished gallantry;--it was all done to assure her that she



<P>had fully recovered his good opinion.--He had been sitting with them



<P>half an hour, she found.&nbsp; It was a pity that she had not come



<P>back earlier!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the hope of diverting her father's thoughts from the disagreeableness



<P>of Mr. Knightley's going to London; and going so suddenly;



<P>and going on horseback, which she knew would be all very bad;



<P>Emma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax, and her dependence



<P>on the effect was justified; it supplied a very useful check,--



<P>interested, without disturbing him.&nbsp; He had long made up his mind

to Jane



<P>Fairfax's going out as governess, and could talk of it cheerfully,



<P>but Mr. Knightley's going to London had been an unexpected blow.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she is to be so



<P>comfortably settled.&nbsp; Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable,



<P>and I dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought



<P>to be.&nbsp; I hope it is a dry situation, and that her health



<P>will be taken good care of.&nbsp; It ought to be a first object,



<P>as I am sure poor Miss Taylor's always was with me.&nbsp; You know,



<P>my dear, she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor



<P>was to us.&nbsp; And I hope she will be better off in one respect,



<P>and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every



<P>thing else into the background.&nbsp; An express arrived at Randalls



<P>to announce the death of Mrs. Churchill!&nbsp; Though her nephew



<P>had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account,



<P>she had not lived above six-and-thirty hours after his return.



<P>A sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded



<P>by her general state, had carried her off after a short struggle.



<P>The great Mrs. Churchill was no more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was felt as such things must be felt.&nbsp; Every body had a



<P>degree of gravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed,



<P>solicitude for the surviving friends; and, in a reasonable time,



<P>curiosity to know where she would be buried.&nbsp; Goldsmith tells us,



<P>that when lovely woman stoops to folly, she has nothing to do



<P>but to die; and when she stoops to be disagreeable, it is equally



<P>to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame. Mrs. Churchill,



<P>after being disliked at least twenty-five years, was now spoken of



<P>with compassionate allowances.&nbsp; In one point she was fully justified.



<P>She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill.&nbsp; The event



<P>acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness



<P>of imaginary complaints.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Poor Mrs. Churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal:



<P>more than any body had ever supposed--and continual pain would try



<P>the temper.&nbsp; It was a sad event--a great shock--with all her faults,



<P>what would Mr. Churchill do without her?&nbsp; Mr. Churchill's loss



<P>would be dreadful indeed.&nbsp; Mr. Churchill would never get over it."--



<P>Even Mr. Weston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said,



<P>"Ah! poor woman, who would have thought it!" and resolved, that his



<P>mourning should be as handsome as possible; and his wife sat sighing



<P>and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense,



<P>true and steady.&nbsp; How it would affect Frank was among the earliest



<P>thoughts of both.&nbsp; It was also a very early speculation with Emma.



<P>The character of Mrs. Churchill, the grief of her husband--her mind



<P>glanced over them both with awe and compassion--and then rested



<P>with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event,



<P>how benefited, how freed.&nbsp; She saw in a moment all the possible

good.



<P>Now, an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter.



<P>Mr. Churchill, independent of his wife, was feared by nobody;



<P>an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew.



<P>All that remained to be wished was, that the nephew should form



<P>the attachment, as, with all her goodwill in the cause, Emma could feel



<P>no certainty of its being already formed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great self-command.



<P>What ever she might feel of brighter hope, she betrayed nothing.&nbsp;

Emma was



<P>gratified, to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character,



<P>and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance.



<P>They spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill's death with mutual forbearance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls, communicating



<P>all that was immediately important of their state and plans.



<P>Mr. Churchill was better than could be expected; and their



<P>first removal, on the departure of the funeral for Yorkshire,



<P>was to be to the house of a very old friend in Windsor, to whom



<P>Mr. Churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years.



<P>At present, there was nothing to be done for Harriet; good wishes



<P>for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma's side.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax,



<P>whose prospects were closing, while Harriet's opened, and whose



<P>engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wished



<P>to shew her kindness--and with Emma it was grown into a first wish.



<P>She had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness;



<P>and the person, whom she had been so many months neglecting, was now



<P>the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of



<P>regard or sympathy.&nbsp; She wanted to be of use to her; wanted to

shew



<P>a value for her society, and testify respect and consideration.



<P>She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at Hartfield.



<P>A note was written to urge it.&nbsp; The invitation was refused, and

by



<P>a verbal message.&nbsp; "Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write;"



<P>and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield, the same morning,



<P>it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited,



<P>though against her own consent, by himself, and that she was suffering



<P>under severe headaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made



<P>him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge's at the



<P>time proposed.&nbsp; Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged--



<P>appetite quite gone--and though there were no absolutely



<P>alarming symptoms, nothing touching the pulmonary complaint,



<P>which was the standing apprehension of the family, Mr. Perry was



<P>uneasy about her.&nbsp; He thought she had undertaken more than she



<P>was equal to, and that she felt it so herself, though she would



<P>not own it.&nbsp; Her spirits seemed overcome.&nbsp; Her present home,



<P>he could not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous disorder:--



<P>confined always to one room;--he could have wished it otherwise--



<P>and her good aunt, though his very old friend, he must acknowledge



<P>to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description.



<P>Her care and attention could not be questioned; they were, in fact,



<P>only too great.&nbsp; He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived

more



<P>evil than good from them.&nbsp; Emma listened with the warmest concern;



<P>grieved for her more and more, and looked around eager to discover



<P>some way of being useful.&nbsp; To take her--be it only an hour



<P>or two--from her aunt, to give her change of air and scene,



<P>and quiet rational conversation, even for an hour or two,



<P>might do her good; and the following morning she wrote again to say,



<P>in the most feeling language she could command, that she would



<P>call for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name--



<P>mentioning that she had Mr. Perry's decided opinion, in favour



<P>of such exercise for his patient.&nbsp; The answer was only in this



<P>short note:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Miss Fairfax's compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal



<P>to any exercise."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but it



<P>was impossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality



<P>shewed indisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she



<P>might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted.



<P>In spite of the answer, therefore, she ordered the carriage, and drove



<P>to Mrs. Bates's, in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her--



<P>but it would not do;--Miss Bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude,



<P>and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be

of



<P>the greatest service--and every thing that message could do was tried--



<P>but all in vain.&nbsp; Miss Bates was obliged to return without success;



<P>Jane was quite unpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out



<P>seemed to make her worse.--Emma wished she could have seen her,



<P>and tried her own powers; but, almost before she could hint the wish,



<P>Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on



<P>no account to let Miss Woodhouse in.&nbsp; "Indeed, the truth was,



<P>that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any body--any body at all--



<P>Mrs. Elton, indeed, could not be denied--and Mrs. Cole had made



<P>such a point--and Mrs. Perry had said so much--but, except them,



<P>Jane would really see nobody."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons, the Mrs. Perrys,



<P>and the Mrs. Coles, who would force themselves anywhere;



<P>neither could she feel any right of preference herself--



<P>she submitted, therefore, and only questioned Miss Bates farther



<P>as to her niece's appetite and diet, which she longed to be able



<P>to assist.&nbsp; On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy,



<P>and very communicative; Jane would hardly eat any thing:--



<P>Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food; but every thing they could



<P>command (and never had any body such good neighbours) was distasteful.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to an



<P>examination of her stores; and some arrowroot of very superior quality



<P>was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note.



<P>In half an hour the arrowroot was returned, with a thousand thanks



<P>from Miss Bates, but "dear Jane would not be satisfied without its



<P>being sent back; it was a thing she could not take--and, moreover,



<P>she insisted on her saying, that she was not at all in want of any thing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering



<P>about the meadows, at some distance from Highbury, on the afternoon



<P>of the very day on which she had, under the plea of being unequal



<P>to any exercise, so peremptorily refused to go out with her in



<P>the carriage, she could have no doubt--putting every thing together--



<P>that Jane was resolved to receive no kindness from her.&nbsp; She was

sorry,



<P>very sorry.&nbsp; Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed



<P>but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits,



<P>inconsistency of action, and inequality of powers; and it mortified



<P>her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling, or esteemed



<P>so little worthy as a friend:&nbsp; but she had the consolation of knowing



<P>that her intentions were good, and of being able to say to herself,



<P>that could Mr. Knightley have been privy to all her attempts



<P>of assisting Jane Fairfax, could he even have seen into her heart,



<P>he would not, on this occasion, have found any thing to reprove.

<B>CHAPTER XIX</B>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>If Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet,



<P>a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured



<P>of her attachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept



<P>another man from unbiased inclination, it was not long that she



<P>had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty.



<P>A very few days brought the party from London, and she had no



<P>sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet,



<P>than she became perfectly satisfied--unaccountable as it was!--



<P>that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley,



<P>and was now forming all her views of happiness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet was a little distressed--did look a little foolish at first:



<P>but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly,



<P>and self-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die



<P>away with the words, and leave her without a care for the past,



<P>and with the fullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to



<P>her friend's approbation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of



<P>that nature, by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.--



<P>Harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at



<P>Astley's, and the dinner the next day; she could dwell on it all



<P>with the utmost delight.&nbsp; But what did such particulars explain?--



<P>The fact was, as Emma could now acknowledge, that Harriet had



<P>always liked Robert Martin; and that his continuing to love her had



<P>been irresistible.--Beyond this, it must ever be unintelligible



<P>to Emma.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her



<P>fresh reason for thinking so.--Harriet's parentage became known.



<P>She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford



<P>her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent



<P>enough to have always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood



<P>of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!--



<P>It was likely to be as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many



<P>a gentleman:&nbsp; but what a connexion had she been preparing for



<P>Mr. Knightley--or for the Churchills--or even for Mr. Elton!--



<P>The stain of illegitimacy, unbleached by nobility or wealth,



<P>would have been a stain indeed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>No objection was raised on the father's side; the young man was



<P>treated liberally; it was all as it should be:&nbsp; and as Emma became



<P>acquainted with Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield,



<P>she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth



<P>which could bid fairest for her little friend.&nbsp; She had no doubt



<P>of Harriet's happiness with any good-tempered man; but with him,



<P>and in the home he offered, there would be the hope of more,



<P>of security, stability, and improvement.&nbsp; She would be placed in

the



<P>midst of those who loved her, and who had better sense than herself;



<P>retired enough for safety, and occupied enough for cheerfulness.



<P>She would be never led into temptation, nor left for it to find her

out.



<P>She would be respectable and happy; and Emma admitted her to be



<P>the luckiest creature in the world, to have created so steady and



<P>persevering an affection in such a man;--or, if not quite the luckiest,



<P>to yield only to herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins,



<P>was less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.--



<P>The intimacy between her and Emma must sink; their friendship must



<P>change into a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought



<P>to be, and must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual,



<P>natural manner.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Before the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and saw



<P>her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction,



<P>as no remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he stood



<P>before them, could impair.--Perhaps, indeed, at that time she



<P>scarcely saw Mr. Elton, but as the clergyman whose blessing at the



<P>altar might next fall on herself.--Robert Martin and Harriet Smith,



<P>the latest couple engaged of the three, were the first to be married.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to the



<P>comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells.--The Mr. Churchills



<P>were also in town; and they were only waiting for November.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared,



<P>by Emma and Mr. Knightley.--They had determined that their marriage



<P>ought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield,



<P>to allow them the fortnight's absence in a tour to the seaside,



<P>which was the plan.--John and Isabella, and every other friend,



<P>were agreed in approving it.&nbsp; But Mr. Woodhouse--how was Mr. Woodhouse



<P>to be induced to consent?--he, who had never yet alluded to their



<P>marriage but as a distant event.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When first sounded on the subject, he was so miserable, that they



<P>were almost hopeless.--A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.--



<P>He began to think it was to be, and that he could not prevent it--



<P>a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation.



<P>Still, however, he was not happy.&nbsp; Nay, he appeared so much otherwise,



<P>that his daughter's courage failed.&nbsp; She could not bear to see



<P>him suffering, to know him fancying himself neglected; and though



<P>her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the



<P>Mr. Knightleys, that when once the event were over, his distress



<P>would be soon over too, she hesitated--she could not proceed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden



<P>illumination of Mr. Woodhouse's mind, or any wonderful change of his



<P>nervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another way.--



<P>Mrs. Weston's poultry-house was robbed one night of all her turkeys--



<P>evidently by the ingenuity of man.&nbsp; Other poultry-yards in the



<P>neighbourhood also suffered.--Pilfering was housebreaking to



<P>Mr. Woodhouse's fears.--He was very uneasy; and but for the sense



<P>of his son-in-law's protection, would have been under wretched alarm



<P>every night of his life.&nbsp; The strength, resolution, and presence



<P>of mind of the Mr. Knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence.



<P>While either of them protected him and his, Hartfield was safe.--



<P>But Mr. John Knightley must be in London again by the end of the



<P>first week in November.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary,



<P>cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at



<P>the moment, she was able to fix her wedding-day--and Mr. Elton was



<P>called on, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert



<P>Martin, to join the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties



<P>have no taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the



<P>particulars detailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby,



<P>and very inferior to her own.--"Very little white satin, very few



<P>lace veils; a most pitiful business!--Selina would stare when she



<P>heard of it."--But, in spite of these deficiencies, the wishes,



<P>the hopes, the confidence, the predictions of the small band



<P>of true friends who witnessed the ceremony, were fully answered



<P>in the perfect happiness of the union.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Time passed on.&nbsp; A few more to-morrows, and the party from London



<P>would be arriving.&nbsp; It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking



<P>of it one morning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and



<P>grieve her, when Mr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts



<P>were put by.&nbsp; After the first chat of pleasure he was silent;



<P>and then, in a graver tone, began with,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have something to tell you, Emma; some news."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Good or bad?" said she, quickly, looking up in his face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not know which it ought to be called."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! good I am sure.--I see it in your countenance.&nbsp; You are trying



<P>not to smile."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am afraid," said he, composing his features, "I am very much afraid,



<P>my dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed! but why so?--I can hardly imagine that any thing which



<P>pleases or amuses you, should not please and amuse me too."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is one subject," he replied, "I hope but one, on which



<P>we do not think alike."&nbsp; He paused a moment, again smiling,



<P>with his eyes fixed on her face.&nbsp; "Does nothing occur to you?--



<P>Do not you recollect?--Harriet Smith."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her cheeks flushed at the name, and she felt afraid of something,



<P>though she knew not what.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Have you heard from her yourself this morning?" cried he.



<P>"You have, I believe, and know the whole."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are prepared for the worst, I see--and very bad it is.



<P>Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared--



<P>and her eyes, in eager gaze, said, "No, this is impossible!"



<P>but her lips were closed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is so, indeed," continued Mr. Knightley; "I have it from Robert



<P>Martin himself.&nbsp; He left me not half an hour ago."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.--I wish our opinions were



<P>the same.&nbsp; But in time they will.&nbsp; Time, you may be sure,

will make



<P>one or the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile,



<P>we need not talk much on the subject."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You mistake me, you quite mistake me," she replied, exerting herself.



<P>"It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy,



<P>but I cannot believe it.&nbsp; It seems an impossibility!--You cannot

mean



<P>to say, that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin.&nbsp; You cannot



<P>mean that he has even proposed to her again--yet.&nbsp; You only mean,



<P>that he intends it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I mean that he has done it," answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling



<P>but determined decision, "and been accepted."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Good God!" she cried.--"Well!"--Then having recourse to her workbasket,



<P>in excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing all the



<P>exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she



<P>must be expressing, she added, "Well, now tell me every thing;



<P>make this intelligible to me.&nbsp; How, where, when?--Let me know it

all.



<P>I never was more surprized--but it does not make me unhappy,



<P>I assure you.--How--how has it been possible?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is a very simple story.&nbsp; He went to town on business three

days ago,



<P>and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting



<P>to send to John.--He delivered these papers to John, at his chambers,



<P>and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley's.



<P>They were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley's. The party



<P>was to be our brother and sister, Henry, John--and Miss Smith.



<P>My friend Robert could not resist.&nbsp; They called for him in their

way;



<P>were all extremely amused; and my brother asked him to dine with



<P>them the next day--which he did--and in the course of that visit



<P>(as I understand) he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet;



<P>and certainly did not speak in vain.--She made him, by her acceptance,



<P>as happy even as he is deserving.&nbsp; He came down by yesterday's

coach,



<P>and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast, to report



<P>his proceedings, first on my affairs, and then on his own.



<P>This is all that I can relate of the how, where, and when.



<P>Your friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her.--



<P>She will give you all the minute particulars, which only woman's



<P>language can make interesting.--In our communications we deal only



<P>in the great.--However, I must say, that Robert Martin's heart seemed



<P>for him, and to me, very overflowing; and that he did mention,



<P>without its being much to the purpose, that on quitting their



<P>box at Astley's, my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley



<P>and little John, and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry;



<P>and that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith



<P>rather uneasy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He stopped.--Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply.&nbsp; To speak,



<P>she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree



<P>of happiness.&nbsp; She must wait a moment, or he would think her mad.



<P>Her silence disturbed him; and after observing her a little while,



<P>he added,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make



<P>you unhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected.



<P>His situation is an evil--but you must consider it as what satisfies



<P>your friend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better



<P>of him as you know him more.&nbsp; His good sense and good principles

would



<P>delight you.--As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your



<P>friend in better hands.&nbsp; His rank in society I would alter if I

could,



<P>which is saying a great deal I assure you, Emma.--You laugh at me



<P>about William Larkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself



<P>not to smile too broadly--she did--cheerfully answering,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match.&nbsp; I

think



<P>Harriet is doing extremely well.&nbsp; Her connexions may be worse than

his.



<P>In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they are.



<P>I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize.



<P>You cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly



<P>unprepared I was!--for I had reason to believe her very lately more



<P>determined against him, much more, than she was before."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You ought to know your friend best," replied Mr. Knightley;



<P>"but I should say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl,



<P>not likely to be very, very determined against any young man who told



<P>her he loved her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma could not help laughing as she answered, "Upon my word,



<P>I believe you know her quite as well as I do.--But, Mr. Knightley,



<P>are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright



<P>accepted him.&nbsp; I could suppose she might in time--but can she already?--



<P>Did not you misunderstand him?--You were both talking of other things;



<P>of business, shows of cattle, or new drills--and might not you,



<P>in the confusion of so many subjects, mistake him?--It was not



<P>Harriet's hand that he was certain of--it was the dimensions of some



<P>famous ox."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and



<P>Robert Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma's feelings,



<P>and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently



<P>passed on Harriet's side, so fresh the sound of those words,



<P>spoken with such emphasis, "No, I hope I know better than to think



<P>of Robert Martin," that she was really expecting the intelligence



<P>to prove, in some measure, premature.&nbsp; It could not be otherwise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you dare say this?" cried Mr. Knightley.&nbsp; "Do you dare to suppose



<P>me so great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?--



<P>What do you deserve?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh!&nbsp; I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put



<P>up with any other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain,



<P>direct answer.&nbsp; Are you quite sure that you understand the terms



<P>on which Mr. Martin and Harriet now are?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am quite sure," he replied, speaking very distinctly, "that he



<P>told me she had accepted him; and that there was no obscurity,



<P>nothing doubtful, in the words he used; and I think I can give you



<P>a proof that it must be so.&nbsp; He asked my opinion as to what he



<P>was now to do.&nbsp; He knew of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he



<P>could apply for information of her relations or friends.&nbsp; Could

I



<P>mention any thing more fit to be done, than to go to Mrs. Goddard?



<P>I assured him that I could not.&nbsp; Then, he said, he would endeavour



<P>to see her in the course of this day."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am perfectly satisfied," replied Emma, with the brightest smiles,



<P>"and most sincerely wish them happy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hope so--for at that time I was a fool."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all



<P>Harriet's good qualities.&nbsp; I have taken some pains for your sake,



<P>and for Robert Martin's sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe



<P>as much in love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her.



<P>I have often talked to her a good deal.&nbsp; You must have seen that



<P>I did.&nbsp; Sometimes, indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting

me



<P>of pleading poor Martin's cause, which was never the case; but, from

all



<P>my observations, I am convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl,



<P>with very good notions, very seriously good principles, and placing



<P>her happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.--



<P>Much of this, I have no doubt, she may thank you for."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Me!" cried Emma, shaking her head.--"Ah! poor Harriet!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little



<P>more praise than she deserved.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of



<P>her father.&nbsp; She was not sorry.&nbsp; She wanted to be alone.&nbsp;

Her mind



<P>was in a state of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her



<P>to be collected.&nbsp; She was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits;



<P>and till she had moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed



<P>and reflected, she could be fit for nothing rational.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her father's business was to announce James's being gone out to put



<P>the horses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls;



<P>and she had, therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her sensations



<P>may be imagined.&nbsp; The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in

the



<P>prospect of Harriet's welfare, she was really in danger of becoming



<P>too happy for security.--What had she to wish for?&nbsp; Nothing, but

to



<P>grow more worthy of him, whose intentions and judgment had been



<P>ever so superior to her own.&nbsp; Nothing, but that the lessons



<P>of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Serious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in her resolutions;



<P>and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the very midst



<P>of them.&nbsp; She must laugh at such a close!&nbsp; Such an end of

the doleful



<P>disappointment of five weeks back!&nbsp; Such a heart--such a Harriet!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now there would be pleasure in her returning--Every thing would



<P>be a pleasure.&nbsp; It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities,



<P>was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from



<P>Mr. Knightley would soon be over.&nbsp; The disguise, equivocation,



<P>mystery, so hateful to her to practise, might soon be over.



<P>She could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect



<P>confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father;



<P>not always listening, but always agreeing to what he said;



<P>and, whether in speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable



<P>persuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day,



<P>or poor Mrs. Weston would be disappointed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They arrived.--Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:--



<P>but hardly had they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse



<P>received the thanks for coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse



<P>was caught through the blind, of two figures passing near the window.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is Frank and Miss Fairfax," said Mrs. Weston.&nbsp; "I was just



<P>going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive



<P>this morning.&nbsp; He stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been



<P>persuaded to spend the day with us.--They are coming in, I hope."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In half a minute they were in the room.&nbsp; Emma was extremely glad



<P>to see him--but there was a degree of confusion--a number of



<P>embarrassing recollections on each side.&nbsp; They met readily and

smiling,



<P>but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said;



<P>and having all sat down again, there was for some time such a blank



<P>in the circle, that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged,



<P>which she had long felt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more,



<P>and of seeing him with Jane, would yield its proportion of pleasure.



<P>When Mr. Weston joined the party, however, and when the baby



<P>was fetched, there was no longer a want of subject or animation--



<P>or of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her



<P>and say,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving



<P>message in one of Mrs. Weston's letters.&nbsp; I hope time has not made



<P>you less willing to pardon.&nbsp; I hope you do not retract what you



<P>then said."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, indeed," cried Emma, most happy to begin, "not in the least.



<P>I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you--and to give



<P>you joy in person."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak



<P>with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Is not she looking well?" said he, turning his eyes towards Jane.



<P>"Better than she ever used to do?--You see how my father and



<P>Mrs. Weston doat upon her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But his spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes,



<P>after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he named



<P>the name of Dixon.--Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced



<P>in her hearing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I can never think of it," she cried, "without extreme shame."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The shame," he answered, "is all mine, or ought to be.&nbsp; But is

it



<P>possible that you had no suspicion?--I mean of late.&nbsp; Early, I

know,



<P>you had none."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I never had the smallest, I assure you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That appears quite wonderful.&nbsp; I was once very near--and I wish

I had--



<P>it would have been better.&nbsp; But though I was always doing wrong

things,



<P>they were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no service.--



<P>It would have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond



<P>of secrecy and told you every thing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is not now worth a regret," said Emma.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have some hope," resumed he, "of my uncle's being persuaded



<P>to pay a visit at Randalls; he wants to be introduced to her.



<P>When the Campbells are returned, we shall meet them in London,



<P>and continue there, I trust, till we may carry her northward.--But now,



<P>I am at such a distance from her--is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?--



<P>Till this morning, we have not once met since the day of reconciliation.



<P>Do not you pity me?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma spoke her pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession



<P>of gay thought, he cried,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! by the bye," then sinking his voice, and looking demure for



<P>the moment--"I hope Mr. Knightley is well?"&nbsp; He paused.--She coloured



<P>and laughed.--"I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember



<P>my wish in your favour.&nbsp; Let me return your congratulations.--



<P>I assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest



<P>and satisfaction.--He is a man whom I cannot presume to praise."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma was delighted, and only wanted him to go on in the same style;



<P>but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his



<P>own Jane, and his next words were,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Did you ever see such a skin?--such smoothness! such delicacy!--



<P>and yet without being actually fair.--One cannot call her fair.



<P>It is a most uncommon complexion, with her dark eye-lashes and hair--



<P>a most distinguishing complexion!&nbsp; So peculiarly the lady in it.--



<P>Just colour enough for beauty."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have always admired her complexion," replied Emma, archly; "but do

not



<P>I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale?--



<P>When we first began to talk of her.--Have you quite forgotten?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! no--what an impudent dog I was!--How could I dare--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But he laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could



<P>not help saying,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time,



<P>you had very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.--



<P>I am sure it was a consolation to you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! no, no, no--how can you suspect me of such a thing?



<P>I was the most miserable wretch!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth.&nbsp; I am sure

it



<P>was a source of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking



<P>us all in.--Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell



<P>you the truth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself



<P>in the same situation.&nbsp; I think there is a little likeness between

us."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He bowed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If not in our dispositions," she presently added, with a look of



<P>true sensibility, "there is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny



<P>which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior



<P>to our own."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"True, true," he answered, warmly.&nbsp; "No, not true on your side.&nbsp;

You can



<P>have no superior, but most true on mine.--She is a complete angel.



<P>Look at her.&nbsp; Is not she an angel in every gesture?&nbsp; Observe

the turn



<P>of her throat.&nbsp; Observe her eyes, as she is looking up at my father.--



<P>You will be glad to hear (inclining his head, and whispering seriously)



<P>that my uncle means to give her all my aunt's jewels.&nbsp; They are

to be



<P>new set.&nbsp; I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head.



<P>Will not it be beautiful in her dark hair?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very beautiful, indeed," replied Emma; and she spoke so kindly,



<P>that he gratefully burst out,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in such



<P>excellent looks!--I would not have missed this meeting for the world.



<P>I should certainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving an



<P>account of a little alarm she had been under, the evening before,



<P>from the infant's appearing not quite well.&nbsp; She believed she had



<P>been foolish, but it had alarmed her, and she had been within half



<P>a minute of sending for Mr. Perry.&nbsp; Perhaps she ought to be ashamed,



<P>but Mr. Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself.--In ten minutes,



<P>however, the child had been perfectly well again.&nbsp; This was



<P>her history; and particularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse,



<P>who commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry,



<P>and only regretted that she had not done it.&nbsp; "She should always

send



<P>for Perry, if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered,



<P>were it only for a moment.&nbsp; She could not be too soon alarmed,



<P>nor send for Perry too often.&nbsp; It was a pity, perhaps, that he



<P>had not come last night; for, though the child seemed well now,



<P>very well considering, it would probably have been better if Perry



<P>had seen it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Frank Churchill caught the name.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Perry!" said he to Emma, and trying, as he spoke, to catch Miss



<P>Fairfax's eye.&nbsp; "My friend Mr. Perry!&nbsp; What are they saying



<P>about Mr. Perry?--Has he been here this morning?--And how does



<P>he travel now?--Has he set up his carriage?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma soon recollected, and understood him; and while she joined



<P>in the laugh, it was evident from Jane's countenance that she



<P>too was really hearing him, though trying to seem deaf.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Such an extraordinary dream of mine!" he cried.&nbsp; "I can never

think



<P>of it without laughing.--She hears us, she hears us, Miss Woodhouse.



<P>I see it in her cheek, her smile, her vain attempt to frown.



<P>Look at her.&nbsp; Do not you see that, at this instant, the very passage



<P>of her own letter, which sent me the report, is passing under her eye--



<P>that the whole blunder is spread before her--that she can attend to



<P>nothing else, though pretending to listen to the others?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile



<P>partly remained as she turned towards him, and said in a conscious,



<P>low, yet steady voice,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!--



<P>They will sometimes obtrude--but how you can court them!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly;



<P>but Emma's feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on



<P>leaving Randalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two

men,



<P>she felt, that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill,



<P>and really regarding him as she did with friendship, she had never



<P>been more sensible of Mr. Knightley's high superiority of character.



<P>The happiness of this most happy day, received its completion, in the



<P>animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced.

<B>CHAPTER XVI</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Every body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton,



<P>was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage.&nbsp; Dinner-parties

and



<P>evening-parties were made for him and his lady; and invitations



<P>flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending



<P>they were never to have a disengaged day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I see how it is," said she.&nbsp; "I see what a life I am to lead



<P>among you.&nbsp; Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated.



<P>We really seem quite the fashion.&nbsp; If this is living in the country,



<P>it is nothing very formidable.&nbsp; From Monday next to Saturday,



<P>I assure you we have not a disengaged day!--A woman with fewer



<P>resources than I have, need not have been at a loss."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>No invitation came amiss to her.&nbsp; Her Bath habits made evening-parties



<P>perfectly natural to her, and Maple Grove had given her a taste



<P>for dinners.&nbsp; She was a little shocked at the want of two



<P>drawing rooms, at the poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being



<P>no ice in the Highbury card-parties. Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry,



<P>Mrs. Goddard and others, were a good deal behind-hand in knowledge



<P>of the world, but she would soon shew them how every thing ought



<P>to be arranged.&nbsp; In the course of the spring she must return their



<P>civilities by one very superior party--in which her card-tables



<P>should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs



<P>in the true style--and more waiters engaged for the evening



<P>than their own establishment could furnish, to carry round



<P>the refreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner



<P>at Hartfield for the Eltons.&nbsp; They must not do less than others,



<P>or she should be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable



<P>of pitiful resentment.&nbsp; A dinner there must be.&nbsp; After Emma

had



<P>talked about it for ten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness,



<P>and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom



<P>of the table himself, with the usual regular difficulty of deciding



<P>who should do it for him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The persons to be invited, required little thought.&nbsp; Besides the

Eltons,



<P>it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all of course--



<P>and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must



<P>be asked to make the eighth:--but this invitation was not given



<P>with equal satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was particularly



<P>pleased by Harriet's begging to be allowed to decline it.



<P>"She would rather not be in his company more than she could help.



<P>She was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy



<P>wife together, without feeling uncomfortable.&nbsp; If Miss Woodhouse



<P>would not be displeased, she would rather stay at home."



<P>It was precisely what Emma would have wished, had she deemed it



<P>possible enough for wishing.&nbsp; She was delighted with the fortitude



<P>of her little friend--for fortitude she knew it was in her to give



<P>up being in company and stay at home; and she could now invite the



<P>very person whom she really wanted to make the eighth, Jane Fairfax.--



<P>Since her last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley,



<P>she was more conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than she had



<P>often been.--Mr. Knightley's words dwelt with her.&nbsp; He had said



<P>that Jane Fairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody



<P>else paid her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This is very true," said she, "at least as far as relates to me,



<P>which was all that was meant--and it is very shameful.--Of the same

age--



<P>and always knowing her--I ought to have been more her friend.--



<P>She will never like me now.&nbsp; I have neglected her too long.&nbsp;

But I



<P>will shew her greater attention than I have done."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Every invitation was successful.&nbsp; They were all disengaged and

all happy.--



<P>The preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was not yet over.



<P>A circumstance rather unlucky occurred.&nbsp; The two eldest little



<P>Knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of



<P>some weeks in the spring, and their papa now proposed bringing them,



<P>and staying one whole day at Hartfield--which one day would be



<P>the very day of this party.--His professional engagements did



<P>not allow of his being put off, but both father and daughter were



<P>disturbed by its happening so.&nbsp; Mr. Woodhouse considered eight



<P>persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear--



<P>and here would be a ninth--and Emma apprehended that it would



<P>be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even



<P>to Hartfield for forty-eight hours without falling in with a dinner-party.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself,



<P>by representing that though he certainly would make them nine,



<P>yet he always said so little, that the increase of noise would be



<P>very immaterial.&nbsp; She thought it in reality a sad exchange for

herself,



<P>to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed



<P>to her instead of his brother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma.



<P>John Knightley came; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town



<P>and must be absent on the very day.&nbsp; He might be able to join them



<P>in the evening, but certainly not to dinner.&nbsp; Mr. Woodhouse was

quite



<P>at ease; and the seeing him so, with the arrival of the little boys



<P>and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate,



<P>removed the chief of even Emma's vexation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The day came, the party were punctually assembled, and Mr. John Knightley



<P>seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable.



<P>Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited



<P>for dinner, he was talking to Miss Fairfax.&nbsp; Mrs. Elton, as elegant



<P>as lace and pearls could make her, he looked at in silence--



<P>wanting only to observe enough for Isabella's information--but Miss



<P>Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he could



<P>talk to her.&nbsp; He had met her before breakfast as he was returning



<P>from a walk with his little boys, when it had been just beginning



<P>to rain.&nbsp; It was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject,



<P>and he said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I



<P>am sure you must have been wet.--We scarcely got home in time.



<P>I hope you turned directly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I went only to the post-office," said she, "and reached home



<P>before the rain was much.&nbsp; It is my daily errand.&nbsp; I always

fetch



<P>the letters when I am here.&nbsp; It saves trouble, and is a something



<P>to get me out.&nbsp; A walk before breakfast does me good."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. John Knightley smiled, and replied,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six



<P>yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you;



<P>and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before.



<P>The post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives.



<P>When you have lived to my age, you will begin to think letters are



<P>never worth going through the rain for."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a little blush, and then this answer,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of



<P>every dearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply



<P>growing older should make me indifferent about letters."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indifferent!&nbsp; Oh! no--I never conceived you could become indifferent.



<P>Letters are no matter of indifference; they are generally a very



<P>positive curse."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters



<P>of friendship."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have often thought them the worst of the two," replied he coolly.



<P>"Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly



<P>ever does."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! you are not serious now.&nbsp; I know Mr. John Knightley too well--



<P>I am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as



<P>any body.&nbsp; I can easily believe that letters are very little to

you,



<P>much less than to me, but it is not your being ten years older than



<P>myself which makes the difference, it is not age, but situation.



<P>You have every body dearest to you always at hand, I, probably,



<P>never shall again; and therefore till I have outlived all my affections,



<P>a post-office, I think, must always have power to draw me out,



<P>in worse weather than to-day."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"When I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of years,"



<P>said John Knightley, "I meant to imply the change of situation



<P>which time usually brings.&nbsp; I consider one as including the other.



<P>Time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within



<P>the daily circle--but that is not the change I had in view for you.



<P>As an old friend, you will allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten



<P>years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was kindly said, and very far from giving offence.&nbsp; A pleasant



<P>"thank you" seemed meant to laugh it off, but a blush, a quivering lip,



<P>a tear in the eye, shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh.



<P>Her attention was now claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being,



<P>according to his custom on such occasions, making the circle of



<P>his guests, and paying his particular compliments to the ladies,



<P>was ending with her--and with all his mildest urbanity, said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out this



<P>morning in the rain.&nbsp; Young ladies should take care of themselves.--



<P>Young ladies are delicate plants.&nbsp; They should take care of their



<P>health and their complexion.&nbsp; My dear, did you change your stockings?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, sir, I did indeed; and I am very much obliged by your kind



<P>solicitude about me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared for.--



<P>I hope your good grand-mama and aunt are well.&nbsp; They are some



<P>of my very old friends.&nbsp; I wish my health allowed me to be a



<P>better neighbour.&nbsp; You do us a great deal of honour to-day, I am

sure.



<P>My daughter and I are both highly sensible of your goodness,



<P>and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel



<P>that he had done his duty, and made every fair lady welcome and easy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>By this time, the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton,



<P>and her remonstrances now opened upon Jane.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Jane, what is this I hear?--Going to the post-office



<P>in the rain!--This must not be, I assure you.--You sad girl,



<P>how could you do such a thing?--It is a sign I was not there



<P>to take care of you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jane very patiently assured her that she had not caught any cold.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! do not tell me.&nbsp; You really are a very sad girl, and do not



<P>know how to take care of yourself.--To the post-office indeed!



<P>Mrs. Weston, did you ever hear the like?&nbsp; You and I must positively



<P>exert our authority."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My advice," said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively, "I certainly



<P>do feel tempted to give.&nbsp; Miss Fairfax, you must not run such risks.--



<P>Liable as you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought



<P>to be particularly careful, especially at this time of year.



<P>The spring I always think requires more than common care.



<P>Better wait an hour or two, or even half a day for your letters,



<P>than run the risk of bringing on your cough again.&nbsp; Now do not

you



<P>feel that you had?&nbsp; Yes, I am sure you are much too reasonable.



<P>You look as if you would not do such a thing again."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! she shall not do such a thing again," eagerly rejoined



<P>Mrs. Elton.&nbsp; "We will not allow her to do such a thing again:"--



<P>and nodding significantly--"there must be some arrangement made,



<P>there must indeed.&nbsp; I shall speak to Mr. E. The man who fetches



<P>our letters every morning (one of our men, I forget his name)



<P>shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you.&nbsp; That will obviate



<P>all difficulties you know; and from us I really think, my dear Jane,



<P>you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are extremely kind," said Jane; "but I cannot give up my



<P>early walk.&nbsp; I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can,



<P>I must walk somewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon



<P>my word, I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Jane, say no more about it.&nbsp; The thing is determined,



<P>that is (laughing affectedly) as far as I can presume to determine



<P>any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master.&nbsp; You know,



<P>Mrs. Weston, you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves.



<P>But I do flatter myself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely



<P>worn out.&nbsp; If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore,



<P>consider that point as settled."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Excuse me," said Jane earnestly, "I cannot by any means consent



<P>to such an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant.



<P>If the errand were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it



<P>always is when I am not here, by my grandmama's."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!--And it is a kindness



<P>to employ our men."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered; but instead



<P>of answering, she began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The post-office is a wonderful establishment!" said she.--



<P>"The regularity and despatch of it!&nbsp; If one thinks of all that

it



<P>has to do, and all that it does so well, it is really astonishing!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is certainly very well regulated."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears!&nbsp; So seldom



<P>that a letter, among the thousands that are constantly passing



<P>about the kingdom, is even carried wrong--and not one in a million,



<P>I suppose, actually lost!&nbsp; And when one considers the variety



<P>of hands, and of bad hands too, that are to be deciphered,



<P>it increases the wonder."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The clerks grow expert from habit.--They must begin with some



<P>quickness of sight and hand, and exercise improves them.&nbsp; If you



<P>want any farther explanation," continued he, smiling, "they are



<P>paid for it.&nbsp; That is the key to a great deal of capacity.



<P>The public pays and must be served well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usual



<P>observations made.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have heard it asserted," said John Knightley, "that the same



<P>sort of handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the



<P>same master teaches, it is natural enough.&nbsp; But for that reason,



<P>I should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females,



<P>for boys have very little teaching after an early age, and scramble



<P>into any hand they can get.&nbsp; Isabella and Emma, I think, do write



<P>very much alike.&nbsp; I have not always known their writing apart."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," said his brother hesitatingly, "there is a likeness.



<P>I know what you mean--but Emma's hand is the strongest."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Isabella and Emma both write beautifully," said Mr. Woodhouse;



<P>"and always did.&nbsp; And so does poor Mrs. Weston"--with half a sigh



<P>and half a smile at her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I never saw any gentleman's handwriting"--Emma began, looking also



<P>at Mrs. Weston; but stopped, on perceiving that Mrs. Weston was



<P>attending to some one else--and the pause gave her time to reflect,



<P>"Now, how am I going to introduce him?--Am I unequal to speaking



<P>his name at once before all these people?&nbsp; Is it necessary



<P>for me to use any roundabout phrase?--Your Yorkshire friend--



<P>your correspondent in Yorkshire;--that would be the way, I suppose,



<P>if I were very bad.--No, I can pronounce his name without the



<P>smallest distress.&nbsp; I certainly get better and better.--Now for

it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again--"Mr. Frank Churchill



<P>writes one of the best gentleman's hands I ever saw."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not admire it," said Mr. Knightley.&nbsp; "It is too small--



<P>wants strength.&nbsp; It is like a woman's writing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was not submitted to by either lady.&nbsp; They vindicated him



<P>against the base aspersion.&nbsp; "No, it by no means wanted strength--



<P>it was not a large hand, but very clear and certainly strong.



<P>Had not Mrs. Weston any letter about her to produce?"&nbsp; No, she

had



<P>heard from him very lately, but having answered the letter, had put



<P>it away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If we were in the other room," said Emma, "if I had my writing-desk,



<P>I am sure I could produce a specimen.&nbsp; I have a note of his.--



<P>Do not you remember, Mrs. Weston, employing him to write for you



<P>one day?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He chose to say he was employed"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner



<P>to convince Mr. Knightley."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill,"



<P>said Mr. Knightley dryly, "writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse,



<P>he will, of course, put forth his best."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Dinner was on table.--Mrs. Elton, before she could be spoken to,



<P>was ready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her with his request



<P>to be allowed to hand her into the dining-parlour, was saying--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Must I go first?&nbsp; I really am ashamed of always leading the way."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jane's solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma.



<P>She had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to know



<P>whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any.&nbsp; She suspected



<P>that it had; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered



<P>but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear,



<P>and that it had not been in vain.&nbsp; She thought there was an air



<P>of greater happiness than usual--a glow both of complexion and spirits.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition



<P>and the expense of the Irish mails;--it was at her tongue's end--



<P>but she abstained.&nbsp; She was quite determined not to utter a word



<P>that should hurt Jane Fairfax's feelings; and they followed



<P>the other ladies out of the room, arm in arm, with an appearance



<P>of good-will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each.

<B>CHAPTER II</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Jane Fairfax was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates's



<P>youngest daughter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the _______ regiment of infantry,



<P>and Miss Jane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure,



<P>hope and interest; but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholy



<P>remembrance of him dying in action abroad--of his widow sinking



<P>under consumption and grief soon afterwards--and this girl.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>By birth she belonged to Highbury:&nbsp; and when at three years old,



<P>on losing her mother, she became the property, the charge,



<P>the consolation, the fondling of her grandmother and aunt, there had



<P>seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there;



<P>of her being taught only what very limited means could command,



<P>and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement,



<P>to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person,



<P>good understanding, and warm-hearted, well-meaning relations.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave



<P>a change to her destiny.&nbsp; This was Colonel Campbell, who had



<P>very highly regarded Fairfax, as an excellent officer and most



<P>deserving young man; and farther, had been indebted to him for



<P>such attentions, during a severe camp-fever, as he believed had saved



<P>his life.&nbsp; These were claims which he did not learn to overlook,



<P>though some years passed away from the death of poor Fairfax,



<P>before his own return to England put any thing in his power.



<P>When he did return, he sought out the child and took notice of her.



<P>He was a married man, with only one living child, a girl,



<P>about Jane's age:&nbsp; and Jane became their guest, paying them long

visits



<P>and growing a favourite with all; and before she was nine years old,



<P>his daughter's great fondness for her, and his own wish of being



<P>a real friend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell



<P>of undertaking the whole charge of her education.&nbsp; It was accepted;



<P>and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell's family,



<P>and had lived with them entirely, only visiting her grandmother



<P>from time to time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others;



<P>the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father



<P>making independence impossible.&nbsp; To provide for her otherwise



<P>was out of Colonel Campbell's power; for though his income, by pay



<P>and appointments, was handsome, his fortune was moderate and must



<P>be all his daughter's; but, by giving her an education, he hoped



<P>to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Such was Jane Fairfax's history.&nbsp; She had fallen into good hands,



<P>known nothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given



<P>an excellent education.&nbsp; Living constantly with right-minded



<P>and well-informed people, her heart and understanding had received



<P>every advantage of discipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell's



<P>residence being in London, every lighter talent had been done



<P>full justice to, by the attendance of first-rate masters.



<P>Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that



<P>friendship could do; and at eighteen or nineteen she was, as far



<P>as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children,



<P>fully competent to the office of instruction herself; but she



<P>was too much beloved to be parted with.&nbsp; Neither father nor mother



<P>could promote, and the daughter could not endure it.&nbsp; The evil

day



<P>was put off.&nbsp; It was easy to decide that she was still too young;



<P>and Jane remained with them, sharing, as another daughter, in all



<P>the rational pleasures of an elegant society, and a judicious



<P>mixture of home and amusement, with only the drawback of the future,



<P>the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind



<P>her that all this might soon be over.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss



<P>Campbell in particular, was the more honourable to each party



<P>from the circumstance of Jane's decided superiority both in beauty



<P>and acquirements.&nbsp; That nature had given it in feature could not



<P>be unseen by the young woman, nor could her higher powers of mind



<P>be unfelt by the parents.&nbsp; They continued together with unabated



<P>regard however, till the marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance,



<P>that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs,



<P>giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior,



<P>engaged the affections of Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable,



<P>almost as soon as they were acquainted; and was eligibly



<P>and happily settled, while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to

be



<P>yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path



<P>of duty; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment



<P>had fixed on for beginning.&nbsp; She had long resolved that one-and-twenty



<P>should be the period.&nbsp; With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate,



<P>she had resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice,



<P>and retire from all the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse,



<P>equal society, peace and hope, to penance and mortification for ever.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such



<P>a resolution, though their feelings did.&nbsp; As long as they lived,



<P>no exertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever;



<P>and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly;



<P>but this would be selfishness:--what must be at last, had better



<P>be soon.&nbsp; Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder



<P>and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay, and spared



<P>her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must



<P>now be relinquished.&nbsp; Still, however, affection was glad to catch



<P>at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment.



<P>She had never been quite well since the time of their daughter's marriage;



<P>and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength,



<P>they must forbid her engaging in duties, which, so far from being



<P>compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits, seemed,



<P>under the most favourable circumstances, to require something



<P>more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with



<P>tolerable comfort.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland, her account



<P>to her aunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some



<P>truths not told.&nbsp; It was her own choice to give the time of their



<P>absence to Highbury; to spend, perhaps, her last months of perfect



<P>liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear:



<P>and the Campbells, whatever might be their motive or motives,



<P>whether single, or double, or treble, gave the arrangement



<P>their ready sanction, and said, that they depended more on a few



<P>months spent in her native air, for the recovery of her health,



<P>than on any thing else.&nbsp; Certain it was that she was to come;



<P>and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which



<P>had been so long promised it--Mr. Frank Churchill--must put up for



<P>the present with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the freshness



<P>of a two years' absence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she did



<P>not like through three long months!--to be always doing more than



<P>she wished, and less than she ought!&nbsp; Why she did not like Jane



<P>Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley



<P>had once told her it was because she saw in her the really



<P>accomplished young woman, which she wanted to be thought herself;



<P>and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time,



<P>there were moments of self-examination in which her conscience could



<P>not quite acquit her.&nbsp; But "she could never get acquainted with

her:



<P>she did not know how it was, but there was such coldness and reserve--



<P>such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not--and then,



<P>her aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she was made such a fuss



<P>with by every body!--and it had been always imagined that they were



<P>to be so intimate--because their ages were the same, every body had



<P>supposed they must be so fond of each other."&nbsp; These were her reasons--



<P>she had no better.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was a dislike so little just--every imputed fault was so magnified



<P>by fancy, that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any



<P>considerable absence, without feeling that she had injured her;



<P>and now, when the due visit was paid, on her arrival, after a two years'



<P>interval, she was particularly struck with the very appearance



<P>and manners, which for those two whole years she had been depreciating.



<P>Jane Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she had



<P>herself the highest value for elegance.&nbsp; Her height was pretty,



<P>just such as almost every body would think tall, and nobody could



<P>think very tall; her figure particularly graceful; her size a most



<P>becoming medium, between fat and thin, though a slight appearance



<P>of ill-health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two.



<P>Emma could not but feel all this; and then, her face--her features--



<P>there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered;



<P>it was not regular, but it was very pleasing beauty.&nbsp; Her eyes,



<P>a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, had never been denied



<P>their praise; but the skin, which she had been used to cavil at,



<P>as wanting colour, had a clearness and delicacy which really needed



<P>no fuller bloom.&nbsp; It was a style of beauty, of which elegance



<P>was the reigning character, and as such, she must, in honour,



<P>by all her principles, admire it:--elegance, which, whether of person



<P>or of mind, she saw so little in Highbury.&nbsp; There, not to be vulgar,



<P>was distinction, and merit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In short, she sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax



<P>with twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense



<P>of rendering justice, and was determining that she would dislike



<P>her no longer.&nbsp; When she took in her history, indeed, her situation,



<P>as well as her beauty; when she considered what all this elegance



<P>was destined to, what she was going to sink from, how she was going



<P>to live, it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion



<P>and respect; especially, if to every well-known particular entitling



<P>her to interest, were added the highly probable circumstance



<P>of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she had so naturally started



<P>to herself.&nbsp; In that case, nothing could be more pitiable



<P>or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on.



<P>Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced



<P>Mr. Dixon's actions from his wife, or of any thing mischievous



<P>which her imagination had suggested at first.&nbsp; If it were love,



<P>it might be simple, single, successless love on her side alone.



<P>She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison,



<P>while a sharer of his conversation with her friend; and from the best,



<P>the purest of motives, might now be denying herself this visit



<P>to Ireland, and resolving to divide herself effectually from



<P>him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Upon the whole, Emma left her with such softened, charitable feelings,



<P>as made her look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury



<P>afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence;



<P>nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These were charming feelings--but not lasting.&nbsp; Before she had



<P>committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for



<P>Jane Fairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices



<P>and errors, than saying to Mr. Knightley, "She certainly is handsome;



<P>she is better than handsome!"&nbsp; Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield



<P>with her grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much



<P>into its usual state.&nbsp; Former provocations reappeared.&nbsp; The

aunt



<P>was as tiresome as ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her



<P>health was now added to admiration of her powers; and they had to



<P>listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter



<P>she ate for breakfast, and how small a slice of mutton for dinner,



<P>as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her



<P>mother and herself; and Jane's offences rose again.&nbsp; They had music;



<P>Emma was obliged to play; and the thanks and praise which necessarily



<P>followed appeared to her an affectation of candour, an air



<P>of greatness, meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very



<P>superior performance.&nbsp; She was, besides, which was the worst of

all,



<P>so cold, so cautious!&nbsp; There was no getting at her real opinion.



<P>Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness, she seemed determined



<P>to hazard nothing.&nbsp; She was disgustingly, was suspiciously reserved.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If any thing could be more, where all was most, she was more



<P>reserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing.



<P>She seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon's character,



<P>or her own value for his company, or opinion of the suitableness



<P>of the match.&nbsp; It was all general approbation and smoothness;



<P>nothing delineated or distinguished.&nbsp; It did her no service however.



<P>Her caution was thrown away.&nbsp; Emma saw its artifice, and returned



<P>to her first surmises.&nbsp; There probably was something more to conceal



<P>than her own preference; Mr. Dixon, perhaps, had been very near



<P>changing one friend for the other, or been fixed only to Miss Campbell,



<P>for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The like reserve prevailed on other topics.&nbsp; She and Mr. Frank

Churchill



<P>had been at Weymouth at the same time.&nbsp; It was known that they

were



<P>a little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could Emma



<P>procure as to what he truly was.&nbsp; "Was he handsome?"--"She believed



<P>he was reckoned a very fine young man."&nbsp; "Was he agreeable?"--



<P>"He was generally thought so."&nbsp; "Did he appear a sensible young

man;



<P>a young man of information?"--"At a watering-place, or in a common



<P>London acquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points.



<P>Manners were all that could be safely judged of, under a much longer



<P>knowledge than they had yet had of Mr. Churchill.&nbsp; She believed



<P>every body found his manners pleasing."&nbsp; Emma could not forgive

her.

<P>Emma could not forgive her;--but as neither provocation nor resentment



<P>were discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the party, and had



<P>seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side,



<P>he was expressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on



<P>business with Mr. Woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not so



<P>openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room,



<P>but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma.



<P>He had been used to think her unjust to Jane, and had now great



<P>pleasure in marking an improvement.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A very pleasant evening," he began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse



<P>had been talked into what was necessary, told that he understood,



<P>and the papers swept away;--"particularly pleasant.&nbsp; You and Miss



<P>Fairfax gave us some very good music.&nbsp; I do not know a more



<P>luxurious state, sir, than sitting at one's ease to be entertained



<P>a whole evening by two such young women; sometimes with music



<P>and sometimes with conversation.&nbsp; I am sure Miss Fairfax must



<P>have found the evening pleasant, Emma.&nbsp; You left nothing undone.



<P>I was glad you made her play so much, for having no instrument



<P>at her grandmother's, it must have been a real indulgence."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am happy you approved," said Emma, smiling; "but I hope I am



<P>not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, my dear," said her father instantly; "that I am sure you



<P>are not.&nbsp; There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are.



<P>If any thing, you are too attentive.&nbsp; The muffin last night--if

it



<P>had been handed round once, I think it would have been enough."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No," said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; "you are not



<P>often deficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension.



<P>I think you understand me, therefore."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>An arch look expressed--"I understand you well enough;" but she



<P>said only, "Miss Fairfax is reserved."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I always told you she was--a little; but you will soon overcome



<P>all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that



<P>has its foundation in diffidence.&nbsp; What arises from discretion



<P>must be honoured."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You think her diffident.&nbsp; I do not see it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Emma," said he, moving from his chair into one close



<P>by her, "you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you



<P>had not a pleasant evening."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions;



<P>and amused to think how little information I obtained."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am disappointed," was his only answer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hope every body had a pleasant evening," said Mr. Woodhouse,



<P>in his quiet way.&nbsp; "I had.&nbsp; Once, I felt the fire rather too

much;



<P>but then I moved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did



<P>not disturb me.&nbsp; Miss Bates was very chatty and good-humoured,



<P>as she always is, though she speaks rather too quick.&nbsp; However,



<P>she is very agreeable, and Mrs. Bates too, in a different way.



<P>I like old friends; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of



<P>young lady, a very pretty and a very well-behaved young lady indeed.



<P>She must have found the evening agreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she



<P>had Emma."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"True, sir; and Emma, because she had Miss Fairfax."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for



<P>the present, said, and with a sincerity which no one could question--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one's eyes from.



<P>I am always watching her to admire; and I do pity her from my heart."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared



<P>to express; and before he could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse,



<P>whose thoughts were on the Bates's, said--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined!



<P>a great pity indeed! and I have often wished--but it is so little one



<P>can venture to do--small, trifling presents, of any thing uncommon--



<P>Now we have killed a porker, and Emma thinks of sending them



<P>a loin or a leg; it is very small and delicate--Hartfield pork is



<P>not like any other pork--but still it is pork--and, my dear Emma,



<P>unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks, nicely fried,



<P>as ours are fried, without the smallest grease, and not roast it,



<P>for no stomach can bear roast pork--I think we had better send the leg--



<P>do not you think so, my dear?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would wish

it.



<P>There will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so very nice,



<P>and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's right, my dear, very right.&nbsp; I had not thought of it before,



<P>but that is the best way.&nbsp; They must not over-salt the leg; and

then,



<P>if it is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled,



<P>just as Serle boils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a



<P>boiled turnip, and a little carrot or parsnip, I do not consider



<P>it unwholesome."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Emma," said Mr. Knightley presently, "I have a piece of news for you.



<P>You like news--and I heard an article in my way hither that I think



<P>will interest you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"News!&nbsp; Oh! yes, I always like news.&nbsp; What is it?--why do

you



<P>smile so?--where did you hear it?--at Randalls?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had time only to say,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls," when the door



<P>was thrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room.



<P>Full of thanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew not which to



<P>give quickest.&nbsp; Mr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment,



<P>and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! my dear sir, how are you this morning?&nbsp; My dear Miss Woodhouse--



<P>I come quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork!



<P>You are too bountiful!&nbsp; Have you heard the news?&nbsp; Mr. Elton

is going



<P>to be married."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she was



<P>so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start,



<P>and a little blush, at the sound.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is my news:--I thought it would interest you,"



<P>said Mr. Knightley, with a smile which implied a conviction



<P>of some part of what had passed between them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But where could you hear it?" cried Miss Bates.&nbsp; "Where could



<P>you possibly hear it, Mr. Knightley?&nbsp; For it is not five minutes



<P>since I received Mrs. Cole's note--no, it cannot be more than five--



<P>or at least ten--for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready



<P>to come out--I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about



<P>the pork--Jane was standing in the passage--were not you, Jane?--



<P>for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting-pan



<P>large enough.&nbsp; So I said I would go down and see, and Jane said,



<P>`Shall I go down instead? for I think you have a little cold,



<P>and Patty has been washing the kitchen.'--`Oh! my dear,'



<P>said I--well, and just then came the note.&nbsp; A Miss Hawkins--



<P>that's all I know.&nbsp; A Miss Hawkins of Bath.&nbsp; But, Mr. Knightley,



<P>how could you possibly have heard it? for the very moment Mr. Cole



<P>told Mrs. Cole of it, she sat down and wrote to me.&nbsp; A Miss Hawkins--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago.



<P>He had just read Elton's letter as I was shewn in, and handed it



<P>to me directly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well! that is quite--I suppose there never was a piece of news more



<P>generally interesting.&nbsp; My dear sir, you really are too bountiful.



<P>My mother desires her very best compliments and regards, and a



<P>thousand thanks, and says you really quite oppress her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We consider our Hartfield pork," replied Mr. Woodhouse--"indeed it



<P>certainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that Emma and I



<P>cannot have a greater pleasure than---"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too good



<P>to us.&nbsp; If ever there were people who, without having great wealth



<P>themselves, had every thing they could wish for, I am sure it is us.



<P>We may well say that `our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.'



<P>Well, Mr. Knightley, and so you actually saw the letter; well--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It was short--merely to announce--but cheerful, exulting, of course."--



<P>Here was a sly glance at Emma.&nbsp; "He had been so fortunate as to--



<P>I forget the precise words--one has no business to remember them.



<P>The information was, as you state, that he was going to be married



<P>to a Miss Hawkins.&nbsp; By his style, I should imagine it just settled."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr. Elton going to be married!" said Emma, as soon as she could speak.



<P>"He will have every body's wishes for his happiness."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He is very young to settle," was Mr. Woodhouse's observation.



<P>"He had better not be in a hurry.&nbsp; He seemed to me very well off



<P>as he was.&nbsp; We were always glad to see him at Hartfield."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!" said Miss Bates,



<P>joyfully; "my mother is so pleased!--she says she cannot



<P>bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress.



<P>This is great news, indeed.&nbsp; Jane, you have never seen



<P>Mr. Elton!--no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jane's curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly



<P>to occupy her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No--I have never seen Mr. Elton," she replied, starting on this appeal;



<P>"is he--is he a tall man?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Who shall answer that question?" cried Emma.&nbsp; "My father would



<P>say `yes,' Mr. Knightley `no;' and Miss Bates and I that he is



<P>just the happy medium.&nbsp; When you have been here a little longer,



<P>Miss Fairfax, you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard



<P>of perfection in Highbury, both in person and mind."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very true, Miss Woodhouse, so she will.&nbsp; He is the very best



<P>young man--But, my dear Jane, if you remember, I told you yesterday



<P>he was precisely the height of Mr. Perry.&nbsp; Miss Hawkins,--I dare

say,



<P>an excellent young woman.&nbsp; His extreme attention to my mother--



<P>wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew, that she might hear the better,



<P>for my mother is a little deaf, you know--it is not much, but she



<P>does not hear quite quick.&nbsp; Jane says that Colonel Campbell is

a



<P>little deaf.&nbsp; He fancied bathing might be good for it--the warm

bath--



<P>but she says it did him no lasting benefit.&nbsp; Colonel Campbell,



<P>you know, is quite our angel.&nbsp; And Mr. Dixon seems a very charming



<P>young man, quite worthy of him.&nbsp; It is such a happiness when good



<P>people get together--and they always do.&nbsp; Now, here will be Mr.

Elton



<P>and Miss Hawkins; and there are the Coles, such very good people;



<P>and the Perrys--I suppose there never was a happier or a better couple



<P>than Mr. and Mrs. Perry.&nbsp; I say, sir," turning to Mr. Woodhouse,



<P>"I think there are few places with such society as Highbury.



<P>I always say, we are quite blessed in our neighbours.--My dear sir,



<P>if there is one thing my mother loves better than another, it is pork--



<P>a roast loin of pork--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"As to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he has been



<P>acquainted with her," said Emma, "nothing I suppose can be known.



<P>One feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance.&nbsp; He has been



<P>gone only four weeks."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nobody had any information to give; and, after a few more wonderings,



<P>Emma said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are silent, Miss Fairfax--but I hope you mean to take



<P>an interest in this news.&nbsp; You, who have been hearing and seeing



<P>so much of late on these subjects, who must have been so deep



<P>in the business on Miss Campbell's account--we shall not excuse



<P>your being indifferent about Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"When I have seen Mr. Elton," replied Jane, " I dare say I



<P>shall be interested--but I believe it requires that with me.



<P>And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married, the impression



<P>may be a little worn off."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, he has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss Woodhouse,"



<P>said Miss Bates, "four weeks yesterday.--A Miss Hawkins!--Well, I had



<P>always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts;



<P>not that I ever--Mrs. Cole once whispered to me--but I immediately said,



<P>`No, Mr. Elton is a most worthy young man--but'--In short, I do



<P>not think I am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries.



<P>I do not pretend to it.&nbsp; What is before me, I see.&nbsp; At the

same time,



<P>nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired--Miss Woodhouse



<P>lets me chatter on, so good-humouredly. She knows I would not



<P>offend for the world.&nbsp; How does Miss Smith do?&nbsp; She seems

quite



<P>recovered now.&nbsp; Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately?



<P>Oh! those dear little children.&nbsp; Jane, do you know I always fancy



<P>Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley.&nbsp; I mean in person--tall, and

with



<P>that sort of look--and not very talkative."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Quite wrong, my dear aunt; there is no likeness at all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand.



<P>One takes up a notion, and runs away with it.&nbsp; Mr. Dixon, you say,



<P>is not, strictly speaking, handsome?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Handsome!&nbsp; Oh! no--far from it--certainly plain.&nbsp; I told

you he



<P>was plain."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain,



<P>and that you yourself--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing.&nbsp; Where I have a regard,



<P>I always think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed



<P>the general opinion, when I called him plain."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away.



<P>The weather does not look well, and grandmama will be uneasy.



<P>You are too obliging, my dear Miss Woodhouse; but we really must



<P>take leave.&nbsp; This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed.



<P>I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole's; but I shall not stop three minutes:



<P>and, Jane, you had better go home directly--I would not have you



<P>out in a shower!--We think she is the better for Highbury already.



<P>Thank you, we do indeed.&nbsp; I shall not attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard,



<P>for I really do not think she cares for any thing but boiled pork:



<P>when we dress the leg it will be another thing.&nbsp; Good morning to

you,



<P>my dear sir.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Mr. Knightley is coming too.&nbsp; Well,

that is



<P>so very!--I am sure if Jane is tired, you will be so kind as to



<P>give her your arm.--Mr. Elton, and Miss Hawkins!--Good morning



<P>to you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma, alone with her father, had half her attention wanted by him



<P>while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry--



<P>and to marry strangers too--and the other half she could give



<P>to her own view of the subject.&nbsp; It was to herself an amusing



<P>and a very welcome piece of news, as proving that Mr. Elton



<P>could not have suffered long; but she was sorry for Harriet:



<P>Harriet must feel it--and all that she could hope was, by giving



<P>the first information herself, to save her from hearing it abruptly



<P>from others.&nbsp; It was now about the time that she was likely to

call.



<P>If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!--and upon its beginning



<P>to rain, Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be



<P>detaining her at Mrs. Goddard's, and that the intelligence would



<P>undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes,



<P>when in came Harriet, with just the heated, agitated look which



<P>hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the



<P>"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what do you think has happened!" which instantly



<P>burst forth, had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation.



<P>As the blow was given, Emma felt that she could not now shew greater



<P>kindness than in listening; and Harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly



<P>through what she had to tell.&nbsp; "She had set out from Mrs. Goddard's



<P>half an hour ago--she had been afraid it would rain--she had been



<P>afraid it would pour down every moment--but she thought she might



<P>get to Hartfield first--she had hurried on as fast as possible;



<P>but then, as she was passing by the house where a young woman



<P>was making up a gown for her, she thought she would just step



<P>in and see how it went on; and though she did not seem to stay



<P>half a moment there, soon after she came out it began to rain,



<P>and she did not know what to do; so she ran on directly, as fast



<P>as she could, and took shelter at Ford's."--Ford's was the principal



<P>woollen-draper, linen-draper, and haberdasher's shop united;



<P>the shop first in size and fashion in the place.--"And so,



<P>there she had set, without an idea of any thing in the world,



<P>full ten minutes, perhaps--when, all of a sudden, who should come in--



<P>to be sure it was so very odd!--but they always dealt at Ford's--



<P>who should come in, but Elizabeth Martin and her brother!--



<P>Dear Miss Woodhouse! only think.&nbsp; I thought I should have fainted.



<P>I did not know what to do.&nbsp; I was sitting near the door--Elizabeth

saw



<P>me directly; but he did not; he was busy with the umbrella.



<P>I am sure she saw me, but she looked away directly, and took



<P>no notice; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop;



<P>and I kept sitting near the door!--Oh! dear; I was so miserable!



<P>I am sure I must have been as white as my gown.&nbsp; I could not go

away



<P>you know, because of the rain; but I did so wish myself anywhere



<P>in the world but there.--Oh! dear, Miss Woodhouse--well, at last,



<P>I fancy, he looked round and saw me; for instead of going



<P>on with her buyings, they began whispering to one another.



<P>I am sure they were talking of me; and I could not help thinking



<P>that he was persuading her to speak to me--(do you think he was,



<P>Miss Woodhouse?)--for presently she came forward--came quite up



<P>to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed ready to shake hands,



<P>if I would.&nbsp; She did not do any of it in the same way that she

used;



<P>I could see she was altered; but, however, she seemed to try to be



<P>very friendly, and we shook hands, and stood talking some time;



<P>but I know no more what I said--I was in such a tremble!--I remember



<P>she said she was sorry we never met now; which I thought almost



<P>too kind!&nbsp; Dear, Miss Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable!



<P>By that time, it was beginning to hold up, and I was determined



<P>that nothing should stop me from getting away--and then--only think!--



<P>I found he was coming up towards me too--slowly you know, and as



<P>if he did not quite know what to do; and so he came and spoke,



<P>and I answered--and I stood for a minute, feeling dreadfully,



<P>you know, one can't tell how; and then I took courage, and said it



<P>did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not got



<P>three yards from the door, when he came after me, only to say,



<P>if I was going to Hartfield, he thought I had much better go round



<P>by Mr. Cole's stables, for I should find the near way quite floated



<P>by this rain.&nbsp; Oh! dear, I thought it would have been the death

of me!



<P>So I said, I was very much obliged to him:&nbsp; you know I could



<P>not do less; and then he went back to Elizabeth, and I came round



<P>by the stables--I believe I did--but I hardly knew where I was,



<P>or any thing about it.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse, I would rather

done



<P>any thing than have it happen:&nbsp; and yet, you know, there was a

sort



<P>of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly.



<P>And Elizabeth, too.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse, do talk to me and

make



<P>me comfortable again."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately in



<P>her power.&nbsp; She was obliged to stop and think.&nbsp; She was not

thoroughly



<P>comfortable herself.&nbsp; The young man's conduct, and his sister's,



<P>seemed the result of real feeling, and she could not but pity them.



<P>As Harriet described it, there had been an interesting mixture



<P>of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour.



<P>But she had believed them to be well-meaning, worthy people before;



<P>and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion?



<P>It was folly to be disturbed by it.&nbsp; Of course, he must be sorry



<P>to lose her--they must be all sorry.&nbsp; Ambition, as well as love,



<P>had probably been mortified.&nbsp; They might all have hoped to rise



<P>by Harriet's acquaintance:&nbsp; and besides, what was the value of



<P>Harriet's description?--So easily pleased--so little discerning;--



<P>what signified her praise?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She exerted herself, and did try to make her comfortable,



<P>by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite



<P>unworthy of being dwelt on,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It might be distressing, for the moment," said she; "but you seem



<P>to have behaved extremely well; and it is over--and may never--



<P>can never, as a first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need



<P>not think about it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet said, "very true," and she "would not think about it;"



<P>but still she talked of it--still she could talk of nothing else;



<P>and Emma, at last, in order to put the Martins out of her head,



<P>was obliged to hurry on the news, which she had meant to give



<P>with so much tender caution; hardly knowing herself whether



<P>to rejoice or be angry, ashamed or only amused, at such a state



<P>of mind in poor Harriet--such a conclusion of Mr. Elton's importance



<P>with her!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Elton's rights, however, gradually revived.&nbsp; Though she did

not



<P>feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before,



<P>or an hour before, its interest soon increased; and before their



<P>first conversation was over, she had talked herself into all the



<P>sensations of curiosity, wonder and regret, pain and pleasure,



<P>as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins, which could conduce to place



<P>the Martins under proper subordination in her fancy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting.



<P>It had been serviceable in deadening the first shock, without retaining



<P>any influence to alarm.&nbsp; As Harriet now lived, the Martins could



<P>not get at her, without seeking her, where hitherto they had wanted



<P>either the courage or the condescension to seek her; for since her



<P>refusal of the brother, the sisters never had been at Mrs. Goddard's;



<P>and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again,



<P>with any necessity, or even any power of speech.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>When the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emma found



<P>it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;--



<P>with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton



<P>engross Jane Fairfax and slight herself.&nbsp; She and Mrs. Weston were



<P>obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together.



<P>Mrs. Elton left them no choice.&nbsp; If Jane repressed her for a



<P>little time, she soon began again; and though much that passed



<P>between them was in a half-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton's side,



<P>there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects:



<P>The post-office--catching cold--fetching letters--and friendship,



<P>were long under discussion; and to them succeeded one, which must



<P>be at least equally unpleasant to Jane--inquiries whether she had



<P>yet heard of any situation likely to suit her, and professions of



<P>Mrs. Elton's meditated activity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here is April come!" said she, "I get quite anxious about you.



<P>June will soon be here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But I have never fixed on June or any other month--merely looked



<P>forward to the summer in general."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But have you really heard of nothing?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any yet."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware



<P>of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I not aware!" said Jane, shaking her head; "dear Mrs. Elton,



<P>who can have thought of it as I have done?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But you have not seen so much of the world as I have.&nbsp; You do

not



<P>know how many candidates there always are for the first situations.



<P>I saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove.



<P>A cousin of Mr. Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an infinity



<P>of applications; every body was anxious to be in her family,



<P>for she moves in the first circle.&nbsp; Wax-candles in the schoolroom!



<P>You may imagine how desirable!&nbsp; Of all houses in the kingdom



<P>Mrs. Bragge's is the one I would most wish to see you in."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer,"



<P>said Jane.&nbsp; "I must spend some time with them; I am sure they will



<P>want it;--afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself.



<P>But I would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries



<P>at present."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Trouble! aye, I know your scruples.&nbsp; You are afraid of giving



<P>me trouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can



<P>hardly be more interested about you than I am.&nbsp; I shall write



<P>to Mrs. Partridge in a day or two, and shall give her a strict



<P>charge to be on the look-out for any thing eligible."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject



<P>to her; till the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving



<P>any body trouble."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April,



<P>and June, or say even July, is very near, with such business



<P>to accomplish before us.&nbsp; Your inexperience really amuses me!



<P>A situation such as you deserve, and your friends would require for

you,



<P>is no everyday occurrence, is not obtained at a moment's notice;



<P>indeed, indeed, we must begin inquiring directly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Excuse me, ma'am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no



<P>inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends.



<P>When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid



<P>of being long unemployed.&nbsp; There are places in town, offices,



<P>where inquiry would soon produce something--Offices for the sale--



<P>not quite of human flesh--but of human intellect."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! my dear, human flesh!&nbsp; You quite shock me; if you mean a fling



<P>at the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather



<P>a friend to the abolition."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade," replied Jane;



<P>"governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view;



<P>widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on;



<P>but as to the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where



<P>it lies.&nbsp; But I only mean to say that there are advertising offices,



<P>and that by applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon



<P>meeting with something that would do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Something that would do!" repeated Mrs. Elton.&nbsp; "Aye, that may



<P>suit your humble ideas of yourself;--I know what a modest creature



<P>you are; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up



<P>with any thing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation,



<P>in a family not moving in a certain circle, or able to command



<P>the elegancies of life."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very indifferent;



<P>it would be no object to me to be with the rich; my mortifications,



<P>I think, would only be the greater; I should suffer more from comparison.



<P>A gentleman's family is all that I should condition for."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; but I



<P>shall be a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will



<P>be quite on my side; with your superior talents, you have a right



<P>to move in the first circle.&nbsp; Your musical knowledge alone would



<P>entitle you to name your own terms, have as many rooms as you like,



<P>and mix in the family as much as you chose;--that is--I do not know--



<P>if you knew the harp, you might do all that, I am very sure;



<P>but you sing as well as play;--yes, I really believe you might,



<P>even without the harp, stipulate for what you chose;--and you must



<P>and shall be delightfully, honourably and comfortably settled before



<P>the Campbells or I have any rest."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort



<P>of such a situation together," said Jane, "they are pretty sure



<P>to be equal; however, I am very serious in not wishing any thing



<P>to be attempted at present for me.&nbsp; I am exceedingly obliged to

you,



<P>Mrs. Elton, I am obliged to any body who feels for me, but I am



<P>quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer.



<P>For two or three months longer I shall remain where I am, and as



<P>I am."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And I am quite serious too, I assure you," replied Mrs. Elton gaily,



<P>"in resolving to be always on the watch, and employing my friends



<P>to watch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In this style she ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing



<P>till Mr. Woodhouse came into the room; her vanity had then a change



<P>of object, and Emma heard her saying in the same half-whisper to Jane,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!--Only think of his



<P>gallantry in coming away before the other men!--what a dear creature



<P>he is;--I assure you I like him excessively.&nbsp; I admire all that

quaint,



<P>old-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern ease;



<P>modern ease often disgusts me.&nbsp; But this good old Mr. Woodhouse,



<P>I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp;

I assure



<P>you I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous.



<P>I fancy I am rather a favourite; he took notice of my gown.



<P>How do you like it?--Selina's choice--handsome, I think, but I



<P>do not know whether it is not over-trimmed; I have the greatest



<P>dislike to the idea of being over-trimmed--quite a horror of finery.



<P>I must put on a few ornaments now, because it is expected of me.



<P>A bride, you know, must appear like a bride, but my natural taste



<P>is all for simplicity; a simple style of dress is so infinitely



<P>preferable to finery.&nbsp; But I am quite in the minority, I believe;



<P>few people seem to value simplicity of dress,--show and finery



<P>are every thing.&nbsp; I have some notion of putting such a trimming



<P>as this to my white and silver poplin.&nbsp; Do you think it will



<P>look well?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room



<P>when Mr. Weston made his appearance among them.&nbsp; He had returned



<P>to a late dinner, and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over.



<P>He had been too much expected by the best judges, for surprize--



<P>but there was great joy.&nbsp; Mr. Woodhouse was almost as glad to see



<P>him now, as he would have been sorry to see him before.&nbsp; John Knightley



<P>only was in mute astonishment.--That a man who might have spent



<P>his evening quietly at home after a day of business in London,



<P>should set off again, and walk half a mile to another man's house,



<P>for the sake of being in mixed company till bed-time, of finishing



<P>his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers,



<P>was a circumstance to strike him deeply.&nbsp; A man who had been in

motion



<P>since eight o'clock in the morning, and might now have been still,



<P>who had been long talking, and might have been silent, who had been



<P>in more than one crowd, and might have been alone!--Such a man,



<P>to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside,



<P>and on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into



<P>the world!--Could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken



<P>back his wife, there would have been a motive; but his coming would



<P>probably prolong rather than break up the party.&nbsp; John Knightley



<P>looked at him with amazement, then shrugged his shoulders, and said,



<P>"I could not have believed it even of him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation



<P>he was exciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all



<P>the right of being principal talker, which a day spent anywhere



<P>from home confers, was making himself agreeable among the rest;



<P>and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner,



<P>convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants



<P>had been forgotten, and spread abroad what public news he had heard,



<P>was proceeding to a family communication, which, though principally



<P>addressed to Mrs. Weston, he had not the smallest doubt of being



<P>highly interesting to every body in the room.&nbsp; He gave her a letter,



<P>it was from Frank, and to herself; he had met with it in his way,



<P>and had taken the liberty of opening it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Read it, read it," said he, "it will give you pleasure;



<P>only a few lines--will not take you long; read it to Emma."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling



<P>and talking to them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued,



<P>but very audible to every body.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, he is coming, you see; good news, I think.&nbsp; Well, what do



<P>you say to it?--I always told you he would be here again soon,



<P>did not I?--Anne, my dear, did not I always tell you so, and you would



<P>not believe me?--In town next week, you see--at the latest, I dare say;



<P>for she is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is



<P>to be done; most likely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday.



<P>As to her illness, all nothing of course.&nbsp; But it is an excellent



<P>thing to have Frank among us again, so near as town.&nbsp; They will

stay



<P>a good while when they do come, and he will be half his time with us.



<P>This is precisely what I wanted.&nbsp; Well, pretty good news, is not

it?



<P>Have you finished it?&nbsp; Has Emma read it all?&nbsp; Put it up, put

it up;



<P>we will have a good talk about it some other time, but it will not



<P>do now.&nbsp; I shall only just mention the circumstance to the others

in a



<P>common way."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion.



<P>Her looks and words had nothing to restrain them.&nbsp; She was happy,



<P>she knew she was happy, and knew she ought to be happy.



<P>Her congratulations were warm and open; but Emma could not speak



<P>so fluently.&nbsp; She was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings,



<P>and trying to understand the degree of her agitation, which she



<P>rather thought was considerable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicative



<P>to want others to talk, was very well satisfied with what she did say,



<P>and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial



<P>communication of what the whole room must have overheard already.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was well that he took every body's joy for granted, or he



<P>might not have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley



<P>particularly delighted.&nbsp; They were the first entitled,



<P>after Mrs. Weston and Emma, to be made happy;--from them he would



<P>have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but she was so deep in conversation



<P>with John Knightley, that it would have been too positive



<P>an interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs. Elton, and



<P>her attention disengaged, he necessarily began on the subject with her.

<P><B>CHAPTER I</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and,



<P>in Emma's opinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day.



<P>She could not think that Harriet's solace or her own sins required more;



<P>and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject



<P>as they returned;--but it burst out again when she thought she



<P>had succeeded, and after speaking some time of what the poor must



<P>suffer in winter, and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive--



<P>"Mr. Elton is so good to the poor!" she found something else must be

done.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates.



<P>She determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers.



<P>There was always sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and



<P>Miss Bates loved to be called on, and she knew she was considered



<P>by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her,



<P>as rather negligent in that respect, and as not contributing what she



<P>ought to the stock of their scanty comforts.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart,



<P>as to her deficiency--but none were equal to counteract the persuasion



<P>of its being very disagreeable,--a waste of time--tiresome women--



<P>and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate



<P>and third-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever,



<P>and therefore she seldom went near them.&nbsp; But now she made the

sudden



<P>resolution of not passing their door without going in--observing,



<P>as she proposed it to Harriet, that, as well as she could calculate,



<P>they were just now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The house belonged to people in business.&nbsp; Mrs. and Miss Bates

occupied



<P>the drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized apartment,



<P>which was every thing to them, the visitors were most cordially



<P>and even gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who with her



<P>knitting was seated in the warmest corner, wanting even to give up



<P>her place to Miss Woodhouse, and her more active, talking daughter,



<P>almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness, thanks for



<P>their visit, solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after



<P>Mr. Woodhouse's health, cheerful communications about her mother's,



<P>and sweet-cake from the beaufet--"Mrs. Cole had just been there,



<P>just called in for ten minutes, and had been so good as to sit an



<P>hour with them, and she had taken a piece of cake and been so kind



<P>as to say she liked it very much; and, therefore, she hoped Miss



<P>Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton.



<P>There was intimacy between them, and Mr. Cole had heard from



<P>Mr. Elton since his going away.&nbsp; Emma knew what was coming; they

must



<P>have the letter over again, and settle how long he had been gone,



<P>and how much he was engaged in company, and what a favourite he



<P>was wherever he went, and how full the Master of the Ceremonies'



<P>ball had been; and she went through it very well, with all the



<P>interest and all the commendation that could be requisite, and always



<P>putting forward to prevent Harriet's being obliged to say a word.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This she had been prepared for when she entered the house;



<P>but meant, having once talked him handsomely over, to be no farther



<P>incommoded by any troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst



<P>all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties.



<P>She had not been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton;



<P>but he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates, she jumped away



<P>from him at last abruptly to the Coles, to usher in a letter from



<P>her niece.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! yes--Mr. Elton, I understand--certainly as to dancing--



<P>Mrs. Cole was telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was--



<P>Mrs. Cole was so kind as to sit some time with us, talking of Jane;



<P>for as soon as she came in, she began inquiring after her,



<P>Jane is so very great a favourite there.&nbsp; Whenever she is with

us,



<P>Mrs. Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough;



<P>and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can.



<P>And so she began inquiring after her directly, saying, `I know you



<P>cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her time



<P>for writing;' and when I immediately said, `But indeed we have,



<P>we had a letter this very morning,' I do not know that I ever saw



<P>any body more surprized.&nbsp; `Have you, upon your honour?' said she;



<P>`well, that is quite unexpected.&nbsp; Do let me hear what she says.'"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma's politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling interest--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately?&nbsp; I am extremely happy.



<P>I hope she is well?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you.&nbsp; You are so kind!" replied the happily deceived aunt,



<P>while eagerly hunting for the letter.--"Oh! here it is.&nbsp; I was

sure



<P>it could not be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see,



<P>without being aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand



<P>so very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table.



<P>I was reading it to Mrs. Cole, and since she went away, I was



<P>reading it again to my mother, for it is such a pleasure to her--



<P>a letter from Jane--that she can never hear it often enough;



<P>so I knew it could not be far off, and here it is, only just under



<P>my huswife--and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what



<P>she says;--but, first of all, I really must, in justice to Jane,



<P>apologise for her writing so short a letter--only two pages you see--



<P>hardly two--and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half.



<P>My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well.



<P>She often says, when the letter is first opened, `Well, Hetty,



<P>now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work'--



<P>don't you, ma'am?--And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive



<P>to make it out herself, if she had nobody to do it for her--



<P>every word of it--I am sure she would pore over it till she had



<P>made out every word.&nbsp; And, indeed, though my mother's eyes are

not



<P>so good as they were, she can see amazingly well still, thank God!



<P>with the help of spectacles.&nbsp; It is such a blessing!&nbsp; My mother's



<P>are really very good indeed.&nbsp; Jane often says, when she is here,



<P>`I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very strong eyes to see



<P>as you do--and so much fine work as you have done too!--I only wish



<P>my eyes may last me as well.'"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath;



<P>and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss



<P>Fairfax's handwriting.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are extremely kind," replied Miss Bates, highly gratified;



<P>"you who are such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself.



<P>I am sure there is nobody's praise that could give us so much pleasure



<P>as Miss Woodhouse's. My mother does not hear; she is a little deaf



<P>you know.&nbsp; Ma'am," addressing her, "do you hear what Miss Woodhouse



<P>is so obliging to say about Jane's handwriting?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment



<P>repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it.



<P>She was pondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming



<P>very rude, of making her escape from Jane Fairfax's letter, and had



<P>almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse,



<P>when Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her attention.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My mother's deafness is very trifling you see--just nothing at all.



<P>By only raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over,



<P>she is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice.&nbsp; But it

is very



<P>remarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me.



<P>Jane speaks so distinct!&nbsp; However, she will not find her grandmama



<P>at all deafer than she was two years ago; which is saying a great



<P>deal at my mother's time of life--and it really is full two years,



<P>you know, since she was here.&nbsp; We never were so long without seeing



<P>her before, and as I was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know



<P>how to make enough of her now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh yes; next week."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed!--that must be a very great pleasure."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you.&nbsp; You are very kind.&nbsp; Yes, next week.&nbsp; Every

body is



<P>so surprized; and every body says the same obliging things.&nbsp; I

am



<P>sure she will be as happy to see her friends at Highbury, as they



<P>can be to see her.&nbsp; Yes, Friday or Saturday; she cannot say which,



<P>because Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one



<P>of those days.&nbsp; So very good of them to send her the whole way!



<P>But they always do, you know.&nbsp; Oh yes, Friday or Saturday next.



<P>That is what she writes about.&nbsp; That is the reason of her writing

out



<P>of rule, as we call it; for, in the common course, we should not have



<P>heard from her before next Tuesday or Wednesday."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, so I imagined.&nbsp; I was afraid there could be little chance



<P>of my hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So obliging of you!&nbsp; No, we should not have heard, if it had not



<P>been for this particular circumstance, of her being to come here



<P>so soon.&nbsp; My mother is so delighted!--for she is to be three months



<P>with us at least.&nbsp; Three months, she says so, positively, as I



<P>am going to have the pleasure of reading to you.&nbsp; The case is,



<P>you see, that the Campbells are going to Ireland.&nbsp; Mrs. Dixon has



<P>persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly.



<P>They had not intended to go over till the summer, but she is so



<P>impatient to see them again--for till she married, last October,



<P>she was never away from them so much as a week, which must make



<P>it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was going to say,



<P>but however different countries, and so she wrote a very urgent letter



<P>to her mother--or her father, I declare I do not know which it was,



<P>but we shall see presently in Jane's letter--wrote in Mr. Dixon's



<P>name as well as her own, to press their coming over directly,



<P>and they would give them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back



<P>to their country seat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy.



<P>Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean--



<P>I do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else;



<P>but it was very natural, you know, that he should like to speak



<P>of his own place while he was paying his addresses--and as Jane used



<P>to be very often walking out with them--for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell



<P>were very particular about their daughter's not walking out



<P>often with only Mr. Dixon, for which I do not at all blame them;



<P>of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell



<P>about his own home in Ireland; and I think she wrote us word



<P>that he had shewn them some drawings of the place, views that he



<P>had taken himself.&nbsp; He is a most amiable, charming young man,



<P>I believe.&nbsp; Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland, from his account



<P>of things."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering



<P>Emma's brain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon,



<P>and the not going to Ireland, she said, with the insidious design



<P>of farther discovery,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed



<P>to come to you at such a time.&nbsp; Considering the very particular



<P>friendship between her and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expected



<P>her to be excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very true, very true, indeed.&nbsp; The very thing that we have always



<P>been rather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have her



<P>at such a distance from us, for months together--not able to come



<P>if any thing was to happen.&nbsp; But you see, every thing turns out



<P>for the best.&nbsp; They want her (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to



<P>come over with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell; quite depend upon it;



<P>nothing can be more kind or pressing than their joint invitation,



<P>Jane says, as you will hear presently; Mr. Dixon does not seem in the



<P>least backward in any attention.&nbsp; He is a most charming young man.



<P>Ever since the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth, when they were



<P>out in that party on the water, and she, by the sudden whirling



<P>round of something or other among the sails, would have been dashed



<P>into the sea at once, and actually was all but gone, if he had not,



<P>with the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her habit--



<P>(I can never think of it without trembling!)--But ever since we



<P>had the history of that day, I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But, in spite of all her friends' urgency, and her own wish



<P>of seeing Ireland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you



<P>and Mrs. Bates?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes--entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and Colonel



<P>and Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right, just what they



<P>should recommend; and indeed they particularly wish her to try



<P>her native air, as she has not been quite so well as usual lately."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am concerned to hear of it.&nbsp; I think they judge wisely.



<P>But Mrs. Dixon must be very much disappointed.&nbsp; Mrs. Dixon,



<P>I understand, has no remarkable degree of personal beauty; is not,



<P>by any means, to be compared with Miss Fairfax."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! no.&nbsp; You are very obliging to say such things--but certainly

not.



<P>There is no comparison between them.&nbsp; Miss Campbell always was



<P>absolutely plain--but extremely elegant and amiable."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, that of course."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th



<P>of November, (as I am going to read to you,) and has never been



<P>well since.&nbsp; A long time, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her?



<P>She never mentioned it before, because she would not alarm us.



<P>Just like her! so considerate!--But however, she is so far from well,



<P>that her kind friends the Campbells think she had better come home,



<P>and try an air that always agrees with her; and they have no doubt



<P>that three or four months at Highbury will entirely cure her--



<P>and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here,



<P>than go to Ireland, if she is unwell. Nobody could nurse her, as we



<P>should do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the



<P>Campbells leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following--



<P>as you will find from Jane's letter.&nbsp; So sudden!--You may guess,



<P>dear Miss Woodhouse, what a flurry it has thrown me in!



<P>If it was not for the drawback of her illness--but I am afraid



<P>we must expect to see her grown thin, and looking very poorly.



<P>I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me, as to that.



<P>I always make a point of reading Jane's letters through to myself first,



<P>before I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for fear of there



<P>being any thing in them to distress her.&nbsp; Jane desired me to do

it,



<P>so I always do:&nbsp; and so I began to-day with my usual caution;



<P>but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell, than I



<P>burst out, quite frightened, with `Bless me! poor Jane is ill!'--



<P>which my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly



<P>alarmed at.&nbsp; However, when I read on, I found it was not near so

bad



<P>as I had fancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her,



<P>that she does not think much about it.&nbsp; But I cannot imagine



<P>how I could be so off my guard.&nbsp; If Jane does not get well soon,



<P>we will call in Mr. Perry.&nbsp; The expense shall not be thought of;



<P>and though he is so liberal, and so fond of Jane that I dare say



<P>he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance, we could not



<P>suffer it to be so, you know.&nbsp; He has a wife and family to maintain,



<P>and is not to be giving away his time.&nbsp; Well, now I have just given

you



<P>a hint of what Jane writes about, we will turn to her letter, and I

am



<P>sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it



<P>for her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am afraid we must be running away," said Emma, glancing at Harriet,



<P>and beginning to rise--"My father will be expecting us.



<P>I had no intention, I thought I had no power of staying more than



<P>five minutes, when I first entered the house.&nbsp; I merely called,



<P>because I would not pass the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates;



<P>but I have been so pleasantly detained!&nbsp; Now, however, we must

wish



<P>you and Mrs. Bates good morning."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded.



<P>She regained the street--happy in this, that though much had been



<P>forced on her against her will, though she had in fact heard



<P>the whole substance of Jane Fairfax's letter, she had been able



<P>to escape the letter itself.

<B>CHAPTER XV</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill



<P>opinion of Mrs. Elton.&nbsp; Her observation had been pretty correct.



<P>Such as Mrs. Elton appeared to her on this second interview,



<P>such she appeared whenever they met again,--self-important, presuming,



<P>familiar, ignorant, and ill-bred. She had a little beauty and a



<P>little accomplishment, but so little judgment that she thought herself



<P>coming with superior knowledge of the world, to enliven and improve



<P>a country neighbourhood; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held



<P>such a place in society as Mrs. Elton's consequence only could surpass.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently



<P>from his wife.&nbsp; He seemed not merely happy with her, but proud.



<P>He had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such



<P>a woman to Highbury, as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal;



<P>and the greater part of her new acquaintance, disposed to commend,



<P>or not in the habit of judging, following the lead of Miss Bates's



<P>good-will, or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever



<P>and as agreeable as she professed herself, were very well satisfied;



<P>so that Mrs. Elton's praise passed from one mouth to another as it



<P>ought to do, unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse, who readily continued her



<P>first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being "very



<P>pleasant and very elegantly dressed."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she had appeared



<P>at first.&nbsp; Her feelings altered towards Emma.--Offended, probably,



<P>by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with,



<P>she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold



<P>and distant; and though the effect was agreeable, the ill-will



<P>which produced it was necessarily increasing Emma's dislike.



<P>Her manners, too--and Mr. Elton's, were unpleasant towards Harriet.



<P>They were sneering and negligent.&nbsp; Emma hoped it must rapidly work



<P>Harriet's cure; but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour



<P>sunk them both very much.--It was not to be doubted that poor



<P>Harriet's attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve,



<P>and her own share in the story, under a colouring the least favourable



<P>to her and the most soothing to him, had in all likelihood been



<P>given also.&nbsp; She was, of course, the object of their joint dislike.--



<P>When they had nothing else to say, it must be always easy to begin



<P>abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity which they dared not shew



<P>in open disrespect to her, found a broader vent in contemptuous



<P>treatment of Harriet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first.



<P>Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be



<P>supposed to recommend the other, but from the very first; and she



<P>was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration--



<P>but without solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting



<P>to assist and befriend her.--Before Emma had forfeited her confidence,



<P>and about the third time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton's



<P>knight-errantry on the subject.--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.--I quite



<P>rave about Jane Fairfax.--A sweet, interesting creature.&nbsp; So mild



<P>and ladylike--and with such talents!--I assure you I think she



<P>has very extraordinary talents.&nbsp; I do not scruple to say that she



<P>plays extremely well.&nbsp; I know enough of music to speak decidedly



<P>on that point.&nbsp; Oh! she is absolutely charming!&nbsp; You will

laugh at



<P>my warmth--but, upon my word, I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax.--



<P>And her situation is so calculated to affect one!--Miss Woodhouse,



<P>we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her.



<P>We must bring her forward.&nbsp; Such talent as hers must not be suffered



<P>to remain unknown.--I dare say you have heard those charming lines of



<P>the poet,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `Full many a flower is born

to blush unseen,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `And waste its

fragrance on the desert air.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I cannot think there is any danger of it," was Emma's calm answer--



<P>"and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax's situation



<P>and understand what her home has been, with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell,



<P>I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she is now in such retirement,



<P>such obscurity, so thrown away.--Whatever advantages she may have



<P>enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end!&nbsp; And I think



<P>she feels it.&nbsp; I am sure she does.&nbsp; She is very timid and

silent.



<P>One can see that she feels the want of encouragement.&nbsp; I like her



<P>the better for it.&nbsp; I must confess it is a recommendation to me.



<P>I am a great advocate for timidity--and I am sure one does



<P>not often meet with it.--But in those who are at all inferior,



<P>it is extremely prepossessing.&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp; I assure you, Jane Fairfax



<P>is a very delightful character, and interests me more than I



<P>can express."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You appear to feel a great deal--but I am not aware how you or any



<P>of Miss Fairfax's acquaintance here, any of those who have known



<P>her longer than yourself, can shew her any other attention than"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare



<P>to act.&nbsp; You and I need not be afraid.&nbsp; If we set the example,



<P>many will follow it as far as they can; though all have not



<P>our situations.&nbsp; We have carriages to fetch and convey her home,



<P>and we live in a style which could not make the addition of



<P>Jane Fairfax, at any time, the least inconvenient.--I should be



<P>extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner,



<P>as could make me regret having asked more than Jane Fairfax



<P>to partake of it.&nbsp; I have no idea of that sort of thing.&nbsp;

It is



<P>not likely that I should, considering what I have been used to.



<P>My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the



<P>other way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense.



<P>Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be--



<P>for we do not at all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling,



<P>in income.--However, my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax.--



<P>I shall certainly have her very often at my house, shall introduce



<P>her wherever I can, shall have musical parties to draw out her talents,



<P>and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation.



<P>My acquaintance is so very extensive, that I have little doubt



<P>of hearing of something to suit her shortly.--I shall introduce her,



<P>of course, very particularly to my brother and sister when they come



<P>to us.&nbsp; I am sure they will like her extremely; and when she gets



<P>a little acquainted with them, her fears will completely wear off,



<P>for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is



<P>highly conciliating.--I shall have her very often indeed while they



<P>are with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in



<P>the barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Poor Jane Fairfax!"--thought Emma.--"You have not deserved this.



<P>You may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a



<P>punishment beyond what you can have merited!--The kindness and protection



<P>of Mrs. Elton!--`Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.'&nbsp; Heavens!&nbsp;

Let me



<P>not suppose that she dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me!--



<P>But upon my honour, there seems no limits to the licentiousness



<P>of that woman's tongue!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma had not to listen to such paradings again--to any so exclusively



<P>addressed to herself--so disgustingly decorated with a "dear Miss



<P>Woodhouse."&nbsp; The change on Mrs. Elton's side soon afterwards appeared,



<P>and she was left in peace--neither forced to be the very particular



<P>friend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton's guidance, the very



<P>active patroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others in a



<P>general way, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what was

done.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She looked on with some amusement.--Miss Bates's gratitude for



<P>Mrs. Elton's attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless



<P>simplicity and warmth.&nbsp; She was quite one of her worthies--



<P>the most amiable, affable, delightful woman--just as accomplished



<P>and condescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered.



<P>Emma's only surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept



<P>those attentions and tolerate Mrs. Elton as she seemed to do.



<P>She heard of her walking with the Eltons, sitting with the Eltons,



<P>spending a day with the Eltons!&nbsp; This was astonishing!--She could

not



<P>have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of Miss Fairfax



<P>could endure such society and friendship as the Vicarage had to offer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She is a riddle, quite a riddle!" said she.--"To chuse to remain



<P>here month after month, under privations of every sort!&nbsp; And now



<P>to chuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton's notice and the penury



<P>of her conversation, rather than return to the superior companions



<P>who have always loved her with such real, generous affection."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells



<P>were gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells



<P>had promised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer,



<P>and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there.



<P>According to Miss Bates--it all came from her--Mrs. Dixon had



<P>written most pressingly.&nbsp; Would Jane but go, means were to be found,



<P>servants sent, friends contrived--no travelling difficulty allowed



<P>to exist; but still she had declined it!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing



<P>this invitation," was Emma's conclusion.&nbsp; "She must be under some



<P>sort of penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself.



<P>There is great fear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.--



<P>She is not to be with the Dixons.&nbsp; The decree is issued by somebody.



<P>But why must she consent to be with the Eltons?--Here is quite a



<P>separate puzzle."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject,



<P>before the few who knew her opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston



<P>ventured this apology for Jane.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage,



<P>my dear Emma--but it is better than being always at home.



<P>Her aunt is a good creature, but, as a constant companion,



<P>must be very tiresome.&nbsp; We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits,



<P>before we condemn her taste for what she goes to."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are right, Mrs. Weston," said Mr. Knightley warmly, "Miss Fairfax



<P>is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton.



<P>Could she have chosen with whom to associate, she would not have



<P>chosen her.&nbsp; But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she receives



<P>attentions from Mrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her a momentary glance;



<P>and she was herself struck by his warmth.&nbsp; With a faint blush,



<P>she presently replied,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Such attentions as Mrs. Elton's, I should have imagined,



<P>would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax.&nbsp; Mrs. Elton's



<P>invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I should not wonder," said Mrs. Weston, "if Miss Fairfax were to have



<P>been drawn on beyond her own inclination, by her aunt's eagerness



<P>in accepting Mrs. Elton's civilities for her.&nbsp; Poor Miss Bates

may



<P>very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater



<P>appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated,



<P>in spite of the very natural wish of a little change."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again; and after a few



<P>minutes silence, he said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Another thing must be taken into consideration too--Mrs. Elton



<P>does not talk to Miss Fairfax as she speaks of her.&nbsp; We all know



<P>the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou, the plainest



<P>spoken amongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond



<P>common civility in our personal intercourse with each other--



<P>a something more early implanted.&nbsp; We cannot give any body the



<P>disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before.



<P>We feel things differently.&nbsp; And besides the operation of this,



<P>as a general principle, you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes



<P>Mrs. Elton by her superiority both of mind and manner; and that,



<P>face to face, Mrs. Elton treats her with all the respect which she



<P>has a claim to.&nbsp; Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell



<P>in Mrs. Elton's way before--and no degree of vanity can prevent



<P>her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action, if not



<P>in consciousness."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax," said Emma.



<P>Little Henry was in her thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy



<P>made her irresolute what else to say.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," he replied, "any body may know how highly I think of her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And yet," said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look,



<P>but soon stopping--it was better, however, to know the worst at once--



<P>she hurried on--"And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself



<P>how highly it is.&nbsp; The extent of your admiration may take you by



<P>surprize some day or other."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick



<P>leather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them together,



<P>or some other cause, brought the colour into his face, as he answered,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! are you there?--But you are miserably behindhand.&nbsp; Mr. Cole



<P>gave me a hint of it six weeks ago."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He stopped.--Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did



<P>not herself know what to think.&nbsp; In a moment he went on--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That will never be, however, I can assure you.&nbsp; Miss Fairfax,



<P>I dare say, would not have me if I were to ask her--and I am very



<P>sure I shall never ask her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma returned her friend's pressure with interest; and was pleased



<P>enough to exclaim,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are not vain, Mr. Knightley.&nbsp; I will say that for you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He seemed hardly to hear her; he was thoughtful--and in a manner



<P>which shewed him not pleased, soon afterwards said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No indeed I have not.&nbsp; You have scolded me too much for match-making,



<P>for me to presume to take such a liberty with you.&nbsp; What I said



<P>just now, meant nothing.&nbsp; One says those sort of things, of course,



<P>without any idea of a serious meaning.&nbsp; Oh! no, upon my word I

have not



<P>the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body.



<P>You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way,



<P>if you were married."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Knightley was thoughtful again.&nbsp; The result of his reverie

was,



<P>"No, Emma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will



<P>ever take me by surprize.--I never had a thought of her in that way,



<P>I assure you."&nbsp; And soon afterwards, "Jane Fairfax is a very charming



<P>young woman--but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect.&nbsp; She has a fault.



<P>She has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault.



<P>"Well," said she, "and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, very soon.&nbsp; He gave me a quiet hint; I told him he was mistaken;



<P>he asked my pardon and said no more.&nbsp; Cole does not want to be

wiser



<P>or wittier than his neighbours."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiser



<P>and wittier than all the world!&nbsp; I wonder how she speaks of the

Coles--



<P>what she calls them!&nbsp; How can she find any appellation for them,



<P>deep enough in familiar vulgarity?&nbsp; She calls you, Knightley--what

can



<P>she do for Mr. Cole?&nbsp; And so I am not to be surprized that Jane



<P>Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her.



<P>Mrs. Weston, your argument weighs most with me.&nbsp; I can much more



<P>readily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates,



<P>than I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax's mind over



<P>Mrs. Elton.&nbsp; I have no faith in Mrs. Elton's acknowledging herself



<P>the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in her being under any



<P>restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good-breeding. I cannot



<P>imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor



<P>with praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she will not

be



<P>continually detailing her magnificent intentions, from the procuring



<P>her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful



<P>exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche-landau."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Jane Fairfax has feeling," said Mr. Knightley--"I do not



<P>accuse her of want of feeling.&nbsp; Her sensibilities, I suspect,



<P>are strong--and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance,



<P>patience, self-controul; but it wants openness.&nbsp; She is reserved,



<P>more reserved, I think, than she used to be--And I love an



<P>open temper.&nbsp; No--till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment,



<P>it had never entered my head.&nbsp; I saw Jane Fairfax and conversed

with



<P>her, with admiration and pleasure always--but with no thought beyond."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, Mrs. Weston," said Emma triumphantly when he left them,



<P>"what do you say now to Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he is so very much occupied



<P>by the idea of not being in love with her, that I should not wonder



<P>if it were to end in his being so at last.&nbsp; Do not beat me."

<B>CHAPTER XIV</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Mrs. Elton was first seen at church:&nbsp; but though devotion might



<P>be interrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew,



<P>and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid,



<P>to settle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty,



<P>or not pretty at all.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety,



<P>to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects;



<P>and she made a point of Harriet's going with her, that the worst of



<P>the business might be gone through as soon as possible.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room



<P>to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago,



<P>to lace up her boot, without recollecting.&nbsp; A thousand vexatious



<P>thoughts would recur.&nbsp; Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders;



<P>and it was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be



<P>recollecting too; but she behaved very well, and was only rather



<P>pale and silent.&nbsp; The visit was of course short; and there was

so



<P>much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it, that Emma



<P>would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady,



<P>and on no account to give one, beyond the nothing-meaning terms



<P>of being "elegantly dressed, and very pleasing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She did not really like her.&nbsp; She would not be in a hurry to find

fault,



<P>but she suspected that there was no elegance;--ease, but not elegance.--



<P>She was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride,



<P>there was too much ease.&nbsp; Her person was rather good; her face



<P>not unpretty; but neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner,



<P>were elegant.&nbsp; Emma thought at least it would turn out so.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As for Mr. Elton, his manners did not appear--but no, she would



<P>not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners.



<P>It was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits,



<P>and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it.



<P>The woman was better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes,



<P>and the privilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his own



<P>good sense to depend on; and when she considered how peculiarly



<P>unlucky poor Mr. Elton was in being in the same room at once with



<P>the woman he had just married, the woman he had wanted to marry,



<P>and the woman whom he had been expected to marry, she must allow him



<P>to have the right to look as little wise, and to be as much affectedly,



<P>and as little really easy as could be.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, Miss Woodhouse," said Harriet, when they had quitted



<P>the house, and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin;



<P>"Well, Miss Woodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?--



<P>Is not she very charming?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a little hesitation in Emma's answer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! yes--very--a very pleasing young woman."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think her beautiful, quite beautiful."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! no--there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune;



<P>and she came in his way."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I dare say," returned Harriet, sighing again, "I dare say she



<P>was very much attached to him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Perhaps she might; but it is not every man's fate to marry the



<P>woman who loves him best.&nbsp; Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home,



<P>and thought this the best offer she was likely to have."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," said Harriet earnestly, "and well she might, nobody could ever



<P>have a better.&nbsp; Well, I wish them happy with all my heart.&nbsp;

And now,



<P>Miss Woodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again.



<P>He is just as superior as ever;--but being married, you know,



<P>it is quite a different thing.&nbsp; No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you

need



<P>not be afraid; I can sit and admire him now without any great misery.



<P>To know that he has not thrown himself away, is such a comfort!--



<P>She does seem a charming young woman, just what he deserves.



<P>Happy creature!&nbsp; He called her `Augusta.'&nbsp; How delightful!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind.&nbsp; She could

then



<P>see more and judge better.&nbsp; From Harriet's happening not to be



<P>at Hartfield, and her father's being present to engage Mr. Elton,



<P>she had a quarter of an hour of the lady's conversation to herself,



<P>and could composedly attend to her; and the quarter of an hour quite



<P>convinced her that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman, extremely well



<P>satisfied with herself, and thinking much of her own importance;



<P>that she meant to shine and be very superior, but with manners which



<P>had been formed in a bad school, pert and familiar; that all her



<P>notions were drawn from one set of people, and one style of living;



<P>that if not foolish she was ignorant, and that her society would



<P>certainly do Mr. Elton no good.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet would have been a better match.&nbsp; If not wise or refined

herself,



<P>she would have connected him with those who were; but Miss Hawkins,



<P>it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit, had been the best



<P>of her own set.&nbsp; The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the pride



<P>of the alliance, and his place and his carriages were the pride



<P>of him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, "My brother



<P>Mr. Suckling's seat;"--a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove.



<P>The grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the



<P>house was modern and well-built. Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably



<P>impressed by the size of the room, the entrance, and all that she



<P>could see or imagine.&nbsp; "Very like Maple Grove indeed!--She was

quite



<P>struck by the likeness!--That room was the very shape and size



<P>of the morning-room at Maple Grove; her sister's favourite room."--



<P>Mr. Elton was appealed to.--"Was not it astonishingly like?--



<P>She could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And the staircase--You know, as I came in, I observed how very like



<P>the staircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house.



<P>I really could not help exclaiming!&nbsp; I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,



<P>it is very delightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so



<P>extremely partial to as Maple Grove.&nbsp; I have spent so many happy



<P>months there! (with a little sigh of sentiment). A charming place,



<P>undoubtedly.&nbsp; Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty;



<P>but to me, it has been quite a home.&nbsp; Whenever you are transplanted,



<P>like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will understand how very delightful it



<P>is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind.



<P>I always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient



<P>for Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So extremely like Maple Grove!&nbsp; And it is not merely the house--



<P>the grounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly



<P>like.&nbsp; The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as

here,



<P>and stand very much in the same way--just across the lawn;



<P>and I had a glimpse of a fine large tree, with a bench round it,



<P>which put me so exactly in mind!&nbsp; My brother and sister will be



<P>enchanted with this place.&nbsp; People who have extensive grounds



<P>themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment.&nbsp; She had a great idea



<P>that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little



<P>for the extensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth



<P>while to attack an error so double-dyed, and therefore only said



<P>in reply,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think



<P>you have overrated Hartfield.&nbsp; Surry is full of beauties."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that.&nbsp; It is the garden of England,



<P>you know.&nbsp; Surry is the garden of England."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction.



<P>Many counties, I believe, are called the garden of England,



<P>as well as Surry."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I fancy not," replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile."



<P>I never heard any county but Surry called so."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma was silenced.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring,



<P>or summer at farthest," continued Mrs. Elton; "and that will be



<P>our time for exploring.&nbsp; While they are with us, we shall explore



<P>a great deal, I dare say.&nbsp; They will have their barouche-landau,



<P>of course, which holds four perfectly; and therefore, without saying



<P>any thing of our carriage, we should be able to explore the different



<P>beauties extremely well.&nbsp; They would hardly come in their chaise,



<P>I think, at that season of the year.&nbsp; Indeed, when the time draws

on,



<P>I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche-landau;



<P>it will be so very much preferable.&nbsp; When people come into a beautiful



<P>country of this sort, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one naturally wishes



<P>them to see as much as possible; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond



<P>of exploring.&nbsp; We explored to King's-Weston twice last summer,



<P>in that way, most delightfully, just after their first having the



<P>barouche-landau.&nbsp; You have many parties of that kind here, I suppose,



<P>Miss Woodhouse, every summer?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No; not immediately here.&nbsp; We are rather out of distance of the

very



<P>striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of;



<P>and we are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed



<P>to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort.



<P>Nobody can be more devoted to home than I am.&nbsp; I was quite



<P>a proverb for it at Maple Grove.&nbsp; Many a time has Selina said,



<P>when she has been going to Bristol, `I really cannot get this girl



<P>to move from the house.&nbsp; I absolutely must go in by myself, though

I



<P>hate being stuck up in the barouche-landau without a companion;



<P>but Augusta, I believe, with her own good-will, would never stir



<P>beyond the park paling.'&nbsp; Many a time has she said so; and yet

I



<P>am no advocate for entire seclusion.&nbsp; I think, on the contrary,



<P>when people shut themselves up entirely from society, it is a very



<P>bad thing; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in



<P>a proper degree, without living in it either too much or too little.



<P>I perfectly understand your situation, however, Miss Woodhouse--



<P>(looking towards Mr. Woodhouse), Your father's state of health must



<P>be a great drawback.&nbsp; Why does not he try Bath?--Indeed he should.



<P>Let me recommend Bath to you.&nbsp; I assure you I have no doubt of

its doing



<P>Mr. Woodhouse good."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving



<P>any benefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown



<P>to you, does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be



<P>useful now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! that's a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse,



<P>where the waters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief



<P>they give.&nbsp; In my Bath life, I have seen such instances of it!



<P>And it is so cheerful a place, that it could not fail of being of



<P>use to Mr. Woodhouse's spirits, which, I understand, are sometimes



<P>much depressed.&nbsp; And as to its recommendations to you, I fancy

I



<P>need not take much pains to dwell on them.&nbsp; The advantages of Bath



<P>to the young are pretty generally understood.&nbsp; It would be a charming



<P>introduction for you, who have lived so secluded a life; and I could



<P>immediately secure you some of the best society in the place.



<P>A line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance; and my



<P>particular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have always resided



<P>with when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any attentions,



<P>and would be the very person for you to go into public with."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite.



<P>The idea of her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called



<P>an introduction--of her going into public under the auspices



<P>of a friend of Mrs. Elton's--probably some vulgar, dashing widow,



<P>who, with the help of a boarder, just made a shift to live!--



<P>The dignity of Miss Woodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk indeed!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could



<P>have given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; "but their going



<P>to Bath was quite out of the question; and she was not perfectly



<P>convinced that the place might suit her better than her father."



<P>And then, to prevent farther outrage and indignation, changed the



<P>subject directly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton.&nbsp; Upon these

occasions,



<P>a lady's character generally precedes her; and Highbury has long



<P>known that you are a superior performer."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea.



<P>A superior performer!--very far from it, I assure you.



<P>Consider from how partial a quarter your information came.



<P>I am doatingly fond of music--passionately fond;--and my friends



<P>say I am not entirely devoid of taste; but as to any thing else,



<P>upon my honour my performance is mediocre to the last degree.



<P>You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play delightfully.&nbsp; I assure

you



<P>it has been the greatest satisfaction, comfort, and delight to me,



<P>to hear what a musical society I am got into.&nbsp; I absolutely cannot



<P>do without music.&nbsp; It is a necessary of life to me; and having

always



<P>been used to a very musical society, both at Maple Grove and in Bath,



<P>it would have been a most serious sacrifice.&nbsp; I honestly said as

much



<P>to Mr. E. when he was speaking of my future home, and expressing



<P>his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable;



<P>and the inferiority of the house too--knowing what I had been



<P>accustomed to--of course he was not wholly without apprehension.



<P>When he was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that the



<P>world I could give up--parties, balls, plays--for I had no fear



<P>of retirement.&nbsp; Blessed with so many resources within myself,



<P>the world was not necessary to me.&nbsp; I could do very well without

it.



<P>To those who had no resources it was a different thing; but my



<P>resources made me quite independent.&nbsp; And as to smaller-sized rooms



<P>than I had been used to, I really could not give it a thought.



<P>I hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description.



<P>Certainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove; but

I



<P>did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness,



<P>nor were spacious apartments.&nbsp; `But,' said I, `to be quite honest,



<P>I do not think I can live without something of a musical society.



<P>I condition for nothing else; but without music, life would be a blank



<P>to me.'"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We cannot suppose," said Emma, smiling, "that Mr. Elton would hesitate



<P>to assure you of there being a very musical society in Highbury;



<P>and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than



<P>may be pardoned, in consideration of the motive."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head.&nbsp; I am delighted



<P>to find myself in such a circle.&nbsp; I hope we shall have many sweet



<P>little concerts together.&nbsp; I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I



<P>must establish a musical club, and have regular weekly meetings



<P>at your house, or ours.&nbsp; Will not it be a good plan?&nbsp; If we



<P>exert ourselves, I think we shall not be long in want of allies.



<P>Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for me,



<P>as an inducement to keep me in practice; for married women, you know--



<P>there is a sad story against them, in general.&nbsp; They are but too

apt



<P>to give up music."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But you, who are so extremely fond of it--there can



<P>be no danger, surely?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I should hope not; but really when I look around among my acquaintance,



<P>I tremble.&nbsp; Selina has entirely given up music--never touches



<P>the instrument--though she played sweetly.&nbsp; And the same may be

said



<P>of Mrs. Jeffereys--Clara Partridge, that was--and of the two Milmans,



<P>now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can enumerate.



<P>Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright.&nbsp; I used to be



<P>quite angry with Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend



<P>that a married woman has many things to call her attention.



<P>I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But every thing of that kind," said Emma, "will soon



<P>be in so regular a train--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well," said Mrs. Elton, laughing, "we shall see."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma, finding her so determined upon neglecting her music,



<P>had nothing more to say; and, after a moment's pause, Mrs. Elton



<P>chose another subject.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We have been calling at Randalls," said she, "and found them



<P>both at home; and very pleasant people they seem to be.



<P>I like them extremely.&nbsp; Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature--



<P>quite a first-rate favourite with me already, I assure you.



<P>And she appears so truly good--there is something so motherly



<P>and kind-hearted about her, that it wins upon one directly.



<P>She was your governess, I think?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton



<P>hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her



<P>so very lady-like!&nbsp; But she is really quite the gentlewoman."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mrs. Weston's manners," said Emma, "were always particularly good.



<P>Their propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safest



<P>model for any young woman."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And who do you think came in while we were there?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma was quite at a loss.&nbsp; The tone implied some old acquaintance--



<P>and how could she possibly guess?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Knightley!" continued Mrs. Elton; "Knightley himself!--Was not



<P>it lucky?--for, not being within when he called the other day,



<P>I had never seen him before; and of course, as so particular a



<P>friend of Mr. E.'s, I had a great curiosity.&nbsp; `My friend Knightley'



<P>had been so often mentioned, that I was really impatient to see him;



<P>and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not



<P>be ashamed of his friend.&nbsp; Knightley is quite the gentleman.



<P>I like him very much.&nbsp; Decidedly, I think, a very gentleman-like

man."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Happily, it was now time to be gone.&nbsp; They were off; and Emma



<P>could breathe.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Insufferable woman!" was her immediate exclamation.&nbsp; "Worse than

I



<P>had supposed.&nbsp; Absolutely insufferable!&nbsp; Knightley!--I could

not



<P>have believed it.&nbsp; Knightley!--never seen him in her life before,



<P>and call him Knightley!--and discover that he is a gentleman!



<P>A little upstart, vulgar being, with her Mr. E., and her caro sposo,



<P>and her resources, and all her airs of pert pretension and



<P>underbred finery.&nbsp; Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is



<P>a gentleman!&nbsp; I doubt whether he will return the compliment,



<P>and discover her to be a lady.&nbsp; I could not have believed it!



<P>And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club!



<P>One would fancy we were bosom friends!&nbsp; And Mrs. Weston!--



<P>Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be



<P>a gentlewoman!&nbsp; Worse and worse.&nbsp; I never met with her equal.



<P>Much beyond my hopes.&nbsp; Harriet is disgraced by any comparison.



<P>Oh! what would Frank Churchill say to her, if he were here?



<P>How angry and how diverted he would be!&nbsp; Ah! there I am--



<P>thinking of him directly.&nbsp; Always the first person to be thought

of!



<P>How I catch myself out!&nbsp; Frank Churchill comes as regularly into



<P>my mind!"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>All this ran so glibly through her thoughts, that by the time



<P>her father had arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons'



<P>departure, and was ready to speak, she was very tolerably capable



<P>of attending.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, my dear," he deliberately began, "considering we never saw



<P>her before, she seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say



<P>she was very much pleased with you.&nbsp; She speaks a little too quick.



<P>A little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear.



<P>But I believe I am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks



<P>like you and poor Miss Taylor.&nbsp; However, she seems a very obliging,



<P>pretty-behaved young lady, and no doubt will make him a very good wife.



<P>Though I think he had better not have married.&nbsp; I made the best



<P>excuses I could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs. Elton



<P>on this happy occasion; I said that I hoped I should in the course



<P>of the summer.&nbsp; But I ought to have gone before.&nbsp; Not to wait

upon



<P>a bride is very remiss.&nbsp; Ah! it shews what a sad invalid I am!



<P>But I do not like the corner into Vicarage Lane."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I dare say your apologies were accepted, sir.&nbsp; Mr. Elton knows

you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes:&nbsp; but a young lady--a bride--I ought to have paid my respects



<P>to her if possible.&nbsp; It was being very deficient."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But, my dear papa, you are no friend to matrimony; and therefore



<P>why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a bride?



<P>It ought to be no recommendation to you.&nbsp; It is encouraging people



<P>to marry if you make so much of them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would



<P>always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady--and a bride,



<P>especially, is never to be neglected.&nbsp; More is avowedly due to

her.



<P>A bride, you know, my dear, is always the first in company,



<P>let the others be who they may."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know



<P>what is.&nbsp; And I should never have expected you to be lending your



<P>sanction to such vanity-baits for poor young ladies."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear, you do not understand me.&nbsp; This is a



<P>matter of mere common politeness and good-breeding,



<P>and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma had done.&nbsp; Her father was growing nervous, and could not



<P>understand her.&nbsp; Her mind returned to Mrs. Elton's offences,



<P>and long, very long, did they occupy her.

<B>CHAPTER IV</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in



<P>interesting situations, that a young person, who either marries



<P>or dies, is sure of being kindly spoken of.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins's name was first



<P>mentioned in Highbury, before she was, by some means or other,



<P>discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind;



<P>to be handsome, elegant, highly accomplished, and perfectly amiable:



<P>and when Mr. Elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects,



<P>and circulate the fame of her merits, there was very little more



<P>for him to do, than to tell her Christian name, and say whose



<P>music she principally played.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Elton returned, a very happy man.&nbsp; He had gone away rejected



<P>and mortified--disappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series



<P>of what appeared to him strong encouragement; and not only losing



<P>the right lady, but finding himself debased to the level of a very



<P>wrong one.&nbsp; He had gone away deeply offended--he came back engaged



<P>to another--and to another as superior, of course, to the first,



<P>as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost.



<P>He came back gay and self-satisfied, eager and busy, caring nothing



<P>for Miss Woodhouse, and defying Miss Smith.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usual advantages



<P>of perfect beauty and merit, was in possession of an independent fortune,



<P>of so many thousands as would always be called ten; a point of



<P>some dignity, as well as some convenience:&nbsp; the story told well;



<P>he had not thrown himself away--he had gained a woman of 10,000 l.



<P>or thereabouts; and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity--



<P>the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by



<P>distinguishing notice; the history which he had to give Mrs. Cole



<P>of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious--the steps



<P>so quick, from the accidental rencontre, to the dinner at Mr. Green's,



<P>and the party at Mrs. Brown's--smiles and blushes rising in importance--



<P>with consciousness and agitation richly scattered--the lady



<P>had been so easily impressed--so sweetly disposed--had in short,



<P>to use a most intelligible phrase, been so very ready to have him,



<P>that vanity and prudence were equally contented.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had caught both substance and shadow--both fortune and affection,



<P>and was just the happy man he ought to be; talking only of himself



<P>and his own concerns--expecting to be congratulated--ready to be



<P>laughed at--and, with cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing



<P>all the young ladies of the place, to whom, a few weeks ago,



<P>he would have been more cautiously gallant.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The wedding was no distant event, as the parties had only themselves



<P>to please, and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for;



<P>and when he set out for Bath again, there was a general expectation,



<P>which a certain glance of Mrs. Cole's did not seem to contradict,



<P>that when he next entered Highbury he would bring his bride.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>During his present short stay, Emma had barely seen him; but just



<P>enough to feel that the first meeting was over, and to give her



<P>the impression of his not being improved by the mixture of pique



<P>and pretension, now spread over his air.&nbsp; She was, in fact,



<P>beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing



<P>at all; and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very



<P>disagreeable feelings, that, except in a moral light, as a penance,



<P>a lesson, a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind,



<P>she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again.



<P>She wished him very well; but he gave her pain, and his welfare



<P>twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The pain of his continued residence in Highbury, however, must certainly



<P>be lessened by his marriage.&nbsp; Many vain solicitudes would be prevented--



<P>many awkwardnesses smoothed by it.&nbsp; A Mrs. Elton would be an excuse

for



<P>any change of intercourse; former intimacy might sink without remark.



<P>It would be almost beginning their life of civility again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Of the lady, individually, Emma thought very little.&nbsp; She was good



<P>enough for Mr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for Highbury--



<P>handsome enough--to look plain, probably, by Harriet's side.



<P>As to connexion, there Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded,



<P>that after all his own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet,



<P>he had done nothing.&nbsp; On that article, truth seemed attainable.



<P>What she was, must be uncertain; but who she was, might be found out;



<P>and setting aside the 10,000 l., it did not appear that she was at



<P>all Harriet's superior.&nbsp; She brought no name, no blood, no alliance.



<P>Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a Bristol--



<P>merchant, of course, he must be called; but, as the whole of the



<P>profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate, it was



<P>not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very



<P>moderate also.&nbsp; Part of every winter she had been used to spend

in Bath;



<P>but Bristol was her home, the very heart of Bristol; for though



<P>the father and mother had died some years ago, an uncle remained--



<P>in the law line--nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded



<P>of him, than that he was in the law line; and with him the daughter



<P>had lived.&nbsp; Emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney,



<P>and too stupid to rise.&nbsp; And all the grandeur of the connexion



<P>seemed dependent on the elder sister, who was very well married,



<P>to a gentleman in a great way, near Bristol, who kept two carriages!



<P>That was the wind-up of the history; that was the glory of



<P>Miss Hawkins.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Could she but have given Harriet her feelings about it all!



<P>She had talked her into love; but, alas! she was not so easily to be



<P>talked out of it.&nbsp; The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies



<P>of Harriet's mind was not to be talked away.&nbsp; He might be superseded



<P>by another; he certainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer;



<P>even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient; but nothing else,



<P>she feared, would cure her.&nbsp; Harriet was one of those, who,



<P>having once begun, would be always in love.&nbsp; And now, poor girl!



<P>she was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr. Elton.



<P>She was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other.&nbsp; Emma

saw



<P>him only once; but two or three times every day Harriet was sure



<P>just to meet with him, or just to miss him, just to hear his voice,



<P>or see his shoulder, just to have something occur to preserve him



<P>in her fancy, in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture.



<P>She was, moreover, perpetually hearing about him; for, excepting when



<P>at Hartfield, she was always among those who saw no fault in Mr. Elton,



<P>and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns;



<P>and every report, therefore, every guess--all that had already



<P>occurred, all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs,



<P>comprehending income, servants, and furniture, was continually



<P>in agitation around her.&nbsp; Her regard was receiving strength by



<P>invariable praise of him, and her regrets kept alive, and feelings



<P>irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins's happiness,



<P>and continual observation of, how much he seemed attached!--



<P>his air as he walked by the house--the very sitting of his hat,



<P>being all in proof of how much he was in love!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Had it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain



<P>to her friend, or reproach to herself, in the waverings of



<P>Harriet's mind, Emma would have been amused by its variations.



<P>Sometimes Mr. Elton predominated, sometimes the Martins; and each



<P>was occasionally useful as a check to the other.&nbsp; Mr. Elton's



<P>engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting Mr. Martin.



<P>The unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been



<P>a little put aside by Elizabeth Martin's calling at Mrs. Goddard's



<P>a few days afterwards.&nbsp; Harriet had not been at home; but a note

had



<P>been prepared and left for her, written in the very style to touch;



<P>a small mixture of reproach, with a great deal of kindness;



<P>and till Mr. Elton himself appeared, she had been much occupied



<P>by it, continually pondering over what could be done in return,



<P>and wishing to do more than she dared to confess.&nbsp; But Mr. Elton,



<P>in person, had driven away all such cares.&nbsp; While he staid,



<P>the Martins were forgotten; and on the very morning of his setting off



<P>for Bath again, Emma, to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned,



<P>judged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin's visit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>How that visit was to be acknowledged--what would be necessary--



<P>and what might be safest, had been a point of some doubtful



<P>consideration.&nbsp; Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters,



<P>when invited to come, would be ingratitude.&nbsp; It must not be:



<P>and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance!--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After much thinking, she could determine on nothing better, than Harriet's



<P>returning the visit; but in a way that, if they had understanding,



<P>should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance.



<P>She meant to take her in the carriage, leave her at the Abbey Mill,



<P>while she drove a little farther, and call for her again so soon,



<P>as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous



<P>recurrences to the past, and give the most decided proof of what



<P>degree of intimacy was chosen for the future.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She could think of nothing better:&nbsp; and though there was something



<P>in it which her own heart could not approve--something of ingratitude,



<P>merely glossed over--it must be done, or what would become of Harriet?

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>The appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered,



<P>was tranquillity itself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her usual employment,



<P>slumbering on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table



<P>near her, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and Jane Fairfax,



<P>standing with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Busy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most



<P>happy countenance on seeing Emma again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This is a pleasure," said he, in rather a low voice, "coming at



<P>least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated.&nbsp; You find me



<P>trying to be useful; tell me if you think I shall succeed."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What!" said Mrs. Weston, "have not you finished it yet? you would



<P>not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have not been working uninterruptedly," he replied, "I have been



<P>assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily,



<P>it was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe.



<P>You see we have been wedging one leg with paper.&nbsp; This was very

kind



<P>of you to be persuaded to come.&nbsp; I was almost afraid you would

be



<P>hurrying home."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficiently



<P>employed in looking out the best baked apple for her, and trying



<P>to make her help or advise him in his work, till Jane Fairfax was



<P>quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again.&nbsp; That she was

not



<P>immediately ready, Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves;



<P>she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it



<P>without emotion; she must reason herself into the power of performance;



<P>and Emma could not but pity such feelings, whatever their origin,



<P>and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given,



<P>the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to.



<P>Mrs. Weston had been delighted before, and was delighted again;



<P>Emma joined her in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every



<P>proper discrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the



<P>highest promise.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ," said Frank Churchill,



<P>with a smile at Emma, "the person has not chosen ill.&nbsp; I heard

a good



<P>deal of Colonel Campbell's taste at Weymouth; and the softness of the



<P>upper notes I am sure is exactly what he and all that party would



<P>particularly prize.&nbsp; I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he either gave



<P>his friend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself.



<P>Do not you think so?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Jane did not look round.&nbsp; She was not obliged to hear.&nbsp; Mrs.

Weston



<P>had been speaking to her at the same moment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is not fair," said Emma, in a whisper; "mine was a random guess.



<P>Do not distress her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little



<P>doubt and very little mercy.&nbsp; Soon afterwards he began again,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure



<P>on this occasion, Miss Fairfax.&nbsp; I dare say they often think of

you,



<P>and wonder which will be the day, the precise day of the instrument's



<P>coming to hand.&nbsp; Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business



<P>to be going forward just at this time?--Do you imagine it to be



<P>the consequence of an immediate commission from him, or that he may



<P>have sent only a general direction, an order indefinite as to time,



<P>to depend upon contingencies and conveniences?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He paused.&nbsp; She could not but hear; she could not avoid answering,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell," said she, in a voice



<P>of forced calmness, "I can imagine nothing with any confidence.



<P>It must be all conjecture."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Conjecture--aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes



<P>one conjectures wrong.&nbsp; I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall



<P>make this rivet quite firm.&nbsp; What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse,



<P>when hard at work, if one talks at all;--your real workmen,



<P>I suppose, hold their tongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get



<P>hold of a word--Miss Fairfax said something about conjecturing.



<P>There, it is done.&nbsp; I have the pleasure, madam, (to Mrs. Bates,)



<P>of restoring your spectacles, healed for the present."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape



<P>a little from the latter, he went to the pianoforte, and begged



<P>Miss Fairfax, who was still sitting at it, to play something more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If you are very kind," said he, "it will be one of the waltzes



<P>we danced last night;--let me live them over again.&nbsp; You did not



<P>enjoy them as I did; you appeared tired the whole time.&nbsp; I believe



<P>you were glad we danced no longer; but I would have given worlds--



<P>all the worlds one ever has to give--for another half-hour."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She played.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What felicity it is to hear a tune again which has made one happy!--



<P>If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She looked up at him for a moment, coloured deeply, and played



<P>something else.&nbsp; He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte,



<P>and turning to Emma, said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here is something quite new to me.&nbsp; Do you know it?--Cramer.--



<P>And here are a new set of Irish melodies.&nbsp; That, from such a quarter,



<P>one might expect.&nbsp; This was all sent with the instrument.&nbsp;

Very thoughtful



<P>of Colonel Campbell, was not it?--He knew Miss Fairfax could have



<P>no music here.&nbsp; I honour that part of the attention particularly;



<P>it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart.&nbsp; Nothing

hastily



<P>done; nothing incomplete.&nbsp; True affection only could have prompted

it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help being amused;



<P>and when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught



<P>the remains of a smile, when she saw that with all the deep blush



<P>of consciousness, there had been a smile of secret delight,



<P>she had less scruple in the amusement, and much less compunction



<P>with respect to her.--This amiable, upright, perfect Jane Fairfax



<P>was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He brought all the music to her, and they looked it over together.--



<P>Emma took the opportunity of whispering,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You speak too plain.&nbsp; She must understand you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hope she does.&nbsp; I would have her understand me.&nbsp; I am not



<P>in the least ashamed of my meaning."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up



<P>the idea."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me.



<P>I have now a key to all her odd looks and ways.&nbsp; Leave shame to

her.



<P>If she does wrong, she ought to feel it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She is not entirely without it, I think."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not see much sign of it.&nbsp; She is playing Robin Adair



<P>at this moment--his favourite."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Shortly afterwards Miss Bates, passing near the window,



<P>descried Mr. Knightley on horse-back not far off.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr. Knightley I declare!--I must speak to him if possible,



<P>just to thank him.&nbsp; I will not open the window here; it would give



<P>you all cold; but I can go into my mother's room you know.&nbsp; I dare



<P>say he will come in when he knows who is here.&nbsp; Quite delightful



<P>to have you all meet so!--Our little room so honoured!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and opening



<P>the casement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley's attention,



<P>and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard



<P>by the others, as if it had passed within the same apartment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How d' ye do?--how d'ye do?--Very well, I thank you.&nbsp; So obliged



<P>to you for the carriage last night.&nbsp; We were just in time;



<P>my mother just ready for us.&nbsp; Pray come in; do come in.&nbsp; You

will



<P>find some friends here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard



<P>in his turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How is your niece, Miss Bates?--I want to inquire after you all,



<P>but particularly your niece.&nbsp; How is Miss Fairfax?--I hope she



<P>caught no cold last night.&nbsp; How is she to-day? Tell me how Miss



<P>Fairfax is."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he



<P>would hear her in any thing else.&nbsp; The listeners were amused;



<P>and Mrs. Weston gave Emma a look of particular meaning.&nbsp; But Emma



<P>still shook her head in steady scepticism.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So obliged to you!--so very much obliged to you for the carriage,"



<P>resumed Miss Bates.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He cut her short with,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am going to Kingston.&nbsp; Can I do anything for you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! dear, Kingston--are you?--Mrs. Cole was saying the other day



<P>she wanted something from Kingston."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mrs. Cole has servants to send.&nbsp; Can I do any thing for you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I thank you.&nbsp; But do come in.&nbsp; Who do you think is here?--



<P>Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the



<P>new pianoforte.&nbsp; Do put up your horse at the Crown, and come in."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well," said he, in a deliberating manner, "for five minutes, perhaps."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!--Quite delightful;



<P>so many friends!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, not now, I thank you.&nbsp; I could not stay two minutes.



<P>I must get on to Kingston as fast as I can."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! do come in.&nbsp; They will be so very happy to see you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, no; your room is full enough.&nbsp; I will call another day,



<P>and hear the pianoforte."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I am so sorry!--Oh!&nbsp; Mr. Knightley, what a delightful party



<P>last night; how extremely pleasant.--Did you ever see such dancing?--



<P>Was not it delightful?--Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill;



<P>I never saw any thing equal to it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I suppose



<P>Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing



<P>that passes.&nbsp; And (raising his voice still more) I do not see why

Miss



<P>Fairfax should not be mentioned too.&nbsp; I think Miss Fairfax dances



<P>very well; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country-dance player,



<P>without exception, in England.&nbsp; Now, if your friends have any gratitude,



<P>they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return;



<P>but I cannot stay to hear it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh!&nbsp; Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence--



<P>so shocked!--Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What is the matter now?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To think of your sending us all your store apples.&nbsp; You said you

had



<P>a great many, and now you have not one left.&nbsp; We really are so

shocked!



<P>Mrs. Hodges may well be angry.&nbsp; William Larkins mentioned it here.



<P>You should not have done it, indeed you should not.&nbsp; Ah! he is

off.



<P>He never can bear to be thanked.&nbsp; But I thought he would have staid

now,



<P>and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned. . . . Well,



<P>(returning to the room,) I have not been able to succeed.



<P>Mr. Knightley cannot stop.&nbsp; He is going to Kingston.&nbsp; He asked

me



<P>if he could do any thing. . . ."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," said Jane, "we heard his kind offers, we heard every thing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the door



<P>was open, and the window was open, and Mr. Knightley spoke loud.



<P>You must have heard every thing to be sure.&nbsp; `Can I do any thing



<P>for you at Kingston?' said he; so I just mentioned. . . . Oh!



<P>Miss Woodhouse, must you be going?--You seem but just come--so very



<P>obliging of you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already



<P>lasted long; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was



<P>perceived to be gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking



<P>leave also, could allow themselves only to walk with the two young



<P>ladies to Hartfield gates, before they set off for Randalls.

<B>CHAPTER XI</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>It may be possible to do without dancing entirely.&nbsp; Instances have



<P>been known of young people passing many, many months successively,



<P>without being at any ball of any description, and no material injury



<P>accrue either to body or mind;--but when a beginning is made--



<P>when the felicities of rapid motion have once been, though slightly,



<P>felt--it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance again;



<P>and the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded



<P>to spend with his daughter at Randalls, was passed by the two young



<P>people in schemes on the subject.&nbsp; Frank's was the first idea;



<P>and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best



<P>judge of the difficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation



<P>and appearance.&nbsp; But still she had inclination enough for shewing



<P>people again how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss



<P>Woodhouse danced--for doing that in which she need not blush to compare



<P>herself with Jane Fairfax--and even for simple dancing itself,



<P>without any of the wicked aids of vanity--to assist him first



<P>in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made



<P>to hold--and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour,



<P>in the hope of discovering, in spite of all that Mr. Weston could



<P>say of their exactly equal size, that it was a little the largest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr. Cole's



<P>should be finished there--that the same party should be collected,



<P>and the same musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence.



<P>Mr. Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment,



<P>and Mrs. Weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they



<P>could wish to dance; and the interesting employment had followed,



<P>of reckoning up exactly who there would be, and portioning out the



<P>indispensable division of space to every couple.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two



<P>Miss Coxes five," had been repeated many times over.&nbsp; "And there



<P>will be the two Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself,



<P>besides Mr. Knightley.&nbsp; Yes, that will be quite enough for pleasure.



<P>You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss



<P>Coxes five; and for five couple there will be plenty of room."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But soon it came to be on one side,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But will there be good room for five couple?--I really do not think



<P>there will."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On another,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth



<P>while to stand up.&nbsp; Five couple are nothing, when one thinks



<P>seriously about it.&nbsp; It will not do to invite five couple.



<P>It can be allowable only as the thought of the moment."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Somebody said that Miss Gilbert was expected at her brother's,



<P>and must be invited with the rest.&nbsp; Somebody else believed



<P>Mrs. Gilbert would have danced the other evening, if she had



<P>been asked.&nbsp; A word was put in for a second young Cox; and at last,



<P>Mr. Weston naming one family of cousins who must be included,



<P>and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out,



<P>it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten,



<P>and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they



<P>could be disposed of.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other.



<P>"Might not they use both rooms, and dance across the passage?"



<P>It seemed the best scheme; and yet it was not so good but that



<P>many of them wanted a better.&nbsp; Emma said it would be awkward;



<P>Mrs. Weston was in distress about the supper; and Mr. Woodhouse



<P>opposed it earnestly, on the score of health.&nbsp; It made him so



<P>very unhappy, indeed, that it could not be persevered in.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! no," said he; "it would be the extreme of imprudence.



<P>I could not bear it for Emma!--Emma is not strong.&nbsp; She would



<P>catch a dreadful cold.&nbsp; So would poor little Harriet.



<P>So you would all.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston, you would be quite laid up;



<P>do not let them talk of such a wild thing.&nbsp; Pray do not let them



<P>talk of it.&nbsp; That young man (speaking lower) is very thoughtless.



<P>Do not tell his father, but that young man is not quite the thing.



<P>He has been opening the doors very often this evening, and keeping



<P>them open very inconsiderately.&nbsp; He does not think of the draught.



<P>I do not mean to set you against him, but indeed he is not quite



<P>the thing!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge.&nbsp; She knew the importance



<P>of it, and said every thing in her power to do it away.&nbsp; Every

door



<P>was now closed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme



<P>of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again;



<P>and with such good-will on Frank Churchill's part, that the space



<P>which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient



<P>for five couple, was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough



<P>for ten.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We were too magnificent," said he.&nbsp; "We allowed unnecessary room.



<P>Ten couple may stand here very well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma demurred.&nbsp; "It would be a crowd--a sad crowd; and what could



<P>be worse than dancing without space to turn in?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very true," he gravely replied; "it was very bad."&nbsp; But still

he



<P>went on measuring, and still he ended with,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, no," said she, "you are quite unreasonable.&nbsp; It would be dreadful



<P>to be standing so close!&nbsp; Nothing can be farther from pleasure



<P>than to be dancing in a crowd--and a crowd in a little room!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is no denying it," he replied.&nbsp; "I agree with you exactly.



<P>A crowd in a little room--Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of giving



<P>pictures in a few words.&nbsp; Exquisite, quite exquisite!--Still, however,



<P>having proceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up.



<P>It would be a disappointment to my father--and altogether--I do



<P>not know that--I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand



<P>here very well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little



<P>self-willed, and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure



<P>of dancing with her; but she took the compliment, and forgave



<P>the rest.&nbsp; Had she intended ever to marry him, it might have been



<P>worth while to pause and consider, and try to understand the value



<P>of his preference, and the character of his temper; but for



<P>all the purposes of their acquaintance, he was quite amiable enough.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Before the middle of the next day, he was at Hartfield; and he entered



<P>the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance



<P>of the scheme.&nbsp; It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, Miss Woodhouse," he almost immediately began, "your inclination



<P>for dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, by the



<P>terrors of my father's little rooms.&nbsp; I bring a new proposal



<P>on the subject:--a thought of my father's, which waits only your



<P>approbation to be acted upon.&nbsp; May I hope for the honour of your



<P>hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball,



<P>to be given, not at Randalls, but at the Crown Inn?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The Crown!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you cannot,



<P>my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there.



<P>Better accommodations, he can promise them, and not a less grateful



<P>welcome than at Randalls.&nbsp; It is his own idea.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston

sees



<P>no objection to it, provided you are satisfied.&nbsp; This is what we



<P>all feel.&nbsp; Oh! you were perfectly right!&nbsp; Ten couple, in either

of



<P>the Randalls rooms, would have been insufferable!--Dreadful!--I felt



<P>how right you were the whole time, but was too anxious for securing



<P>any thing to like to yield.&nbsp; Is not it a good exchange?--You consent--



<P>I hope you consent?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and



<P>Mrs. Weston do not.&nbsp; I think it admirable; and, as far as I can



<P>answer for myself, shall be most happy--It seems the only improvement



<P>that could be.&nbsp; Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fully



<P>comprehended; and then, being quite new, farther representations



<P>were necessary to make it acceptable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No; he thought it very far from an improvement--a very bad plan--



<P>much worse than the other.&nbsp; A room at an inn was always damp



<P>and dangerous; never properly aired, or fit to be inhabited.



<P>If they must dance, they had better dance at Randalls.&nbsp; He had

never



<P>been in the room at the Crown in his life--did not know the people



<P>who kept it by sight.--Oh! no--a very bad plan.&nbsp; They would catch



<P>worse colds at the Crown than anywhere."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was going to observe, sir," said Frank Churchill,



<P>"that one of the great recommendations of this change would



<P>be the very little danger of any body's catching cold--



<P>so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls!&nbsp; Mr. Perry



<P>might have reason to regret the alteration, but nobody else could."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sir," said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, "you are very much



<P>mistaken if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character.



<P>Mr. Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill.&nbsp; But I



<P>do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you



<P>than your father's house."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir.&nbsp; We shall

have



<P>no occasion to open the windows at all--not once the whole evening;



<P>and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold



<P>air upon heated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Open the windows!--but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think



<P>of opening the windows at Randalls.&nbsp; Nobody could be so imprudent!



<P>I never heard of such a thing.&nbsp; Dancing with open windows!--I am

sure,



<P>neither your father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was)



<P>would suffer it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! sir--but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind



<P>a window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected.



<P>I have often known it done myself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Have you indeed, sir?--Bless me!&nbsp; I never could have supposed

it.



<P>But I live out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear.



<P>However, this does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come



<P>to talk it over--but these sort of things require a good deal



<P>of consideration.&nbsp; One cannot resolve upon them in a hurry.



<P>If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning,



<P>we may talk it over, and see what can be done."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh!" interrupted Emma, "there will be plenty of time for talking



<P>every thing over.&nbsp; There is no hurry at all.&nbsp; If it can be

contrived



<P>to be at the Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses.



<P>They will be so near their own stable."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So they will, my dear.&nbsp; That is a great thing.&nbsp; Not that

James



<P>ever complains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can.



<P>If I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired--but is



<P>Mrs. Stokes to be trusted?&nbsp; I doubt it.&nbsp; I do not know her,



<P>even by sight."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will



<P>be under Mrs. Weston's care.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct



<P>the whole."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There, papa!--Now you must be satisfied--Our own dear Mrs. Weston,



<P>who is carefulness itself.&nbsp; Do not you remember what Mr. Perry

said,



<P>so many years ago, when I had the measles?&nbsp; `If Miss Taylor undertakes



<P>to wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.'&nbsp; How often



<P>have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Aye, very true.&nbsp; Mr. Perry did say so.&nbsp; I shall never forget

it.



<P>Poor little Emma!&nbsp; You were very bad with the measles; that is,



<P>you would have been very bad, but for Perry's great attention.



<P>He came four times a day for a week.&nbsp; He said, from the first,



<P>it was a very good sort--which was our great comfort; but the measles



<P>are a dreadful complaint.&nbsp; I hope whenever poor Isabella's little

ones



<P>have the measles, she will send for Perry."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment,"



<P>said Frank Churchill, "examining the capabilities of the house.



<P>I left them there and came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion,



<P>and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice



<P>on the spot.&nbsp; I was desired to say so from both.&nbsp; It would

be the



<P>greatest pleasure to them, if you could allow me to attend you there.



<P>They can do nothing satisfactorily without you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father,



<P>engaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young



<P>people set off together without delay for the Crown.&nbsp; There were



<P>Mr. and Mrs. Weston; delighted to see her and receive her approbation,



<P>very busy and very happy in their different way; she, in some



<P>little distress; and he, finding every thing perfect.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Emma," said she, "this paper is worse than I expected.



<P>Look! in places you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot



<P>is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear, you are too particular," said her husband.&nbsp; "What does



<P>all that signify?&nbsp; You will see nothing of it by candlelight.



<P>It will be as clean as Randalls by candlelight.&nbsp; We never see any



<P>thing of it on our club-nights."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, "Men never



<P>know when things are dirty or not;" and the gentlemen perhaps



<P>thought each to himself, "Women will have their little nonsenses



<P>and needless cares."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain.



<P>It regarded a supper-room.&nbsp; At the time of the ballroom's being

built,



<P>suppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining,



<P>was the only addition.&nbsp; What was to be done?&nbsp; This card-room

would



<P>be wanted as a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted



<P>unnecessary by their four selves, still was it not too small for



<P>any comfortable supper?&nbsp; Another room of much better size might

be



<P>secured for the purpose; but it was at the other end of the house,



<P>and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it.



<P>This made a difficulty.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston was afraid of draughts



<P>for the young people in that passage; and neither Emma nor the



<P>gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded



<P>at supper.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches,



<P>&amp;c., set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a



<P>wretched suggestion.&nbsp; A private dance, without sitting down to

supper,



<P>was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women;



<P>and Mrs. Weston must not speak of it again.&nbsp; She then took another



<P>line of expediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not think it is so very small.&nbsp; We shall not be many,



<P>you know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps



<P>through the passage, was calling out,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear.



<P>It is a mere nothing after all; and not the least draught from



<P>the stairs."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wish," said Mrs. Weston, "one could know which arrangement our



<P>guests in general would like best.&nbsp; To do what would be most generally



<P>pleasing must be our object--if one could but tell what that would be."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, very true," cried Frank, "very true.&nbsp; You want your neighbours'



<P>opinions.&nbsp; I do not wonder at you.&nbsp; If one could ascertain

what the



<P>chief of them--the Coles, for instance.&nbsp; They are not far off.



<P>Shall I call upon them?&nbsp; Or Miss Bates?&nbsp; She is still nearer.--



<P>And I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand



<P>the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body.&nbsp; I think



<P>we do want a larger council.&nbsp; Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates



<P>to join us?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well--if you please," said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, "if you



<P>think she will be of any use."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates," said Emma.



<P>"She will be all delight and gratitude, but she will tell you nothing.



<P>She will not even listen to your questions.&nbsp; I see no advantage

in



<P>consulting Miss Bates."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But she is so amusing, so extremely amusing!&nbsp; I am very fond



<P>of hearing Miss Bates talk.&nbsp; And I need not bring the whole family,



<P>you know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Here Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed,



<P>gave it his decided approbation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Aye, do, Frank.--Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matter



<P>at once.&nbsp; She will enjoy the scheme, I am sure; and I do not know



<P>a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties.



<P>Fetch Miss Bates.&nbsp; We are growing a little too nice.&nbsp; She

is



<P>a standing lesson of how to be happy.&nbsp; But fetch them both.



<P>Invite them both."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Both sir!&nbsp; Can the old lady?" . . .

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The old lady!&nbsp; No, the young lady, to be sure.&nbsp; I shall think

you



<P>a great blockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh!&nbsp; I beg your pardon, sir.&nbsp; I did not immediately recollect.



<P>Undoubtedly if you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade them both."



<P>And away he ran.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Long before he reappeared, attending the short, neat, brisk-moving aunt,



<P>and her elegant niece,--Mrs. Weston, like a sweet-tempered



<P>woman and a good wife, had examined the passage again,



<P>and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before--



<P>indeed very trifling; and here ended the difficulties of decision.



<P>All the rest, in speculation at least, was perfectly smooth.



<P>All the minor arrangements of table and chair, lights and music,



<P>tea and supper, made themselves; or were left as mere trifles



<P>to be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs. Stokes.--



<P>Every body invited, was certainly to come; Frank had already written



<P>to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight,



<P>which could not possibly be refused.&nbsp; And a delightful dance it

was



<P>to be.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Most cordially, when Miss Bates arrived, did she agree that it must.



<P>As a counsellor she was not wanted; but as an approver, (a much



<P>safer character,) she was truly welcome.&nbsp; Her approbation, at once



<P>general and minute, warm and incessant, could not but please;



<P>and for another half-hour they were all walking to and fro,



<P>between the different rooms, some suggesting, some attending,



<P>and all in happy enjoyment of the future.&nbsp; The party did not break



<P>up without Emma's being positively secured for the two first dances



<P>by the hero of the evening, nor without her overhearing Mr. Weston



<P>whisper to his wife, "He has asked her, my dear.&nbsp; That's right.



<P>I knew he would!"

<B>CHAPTER V</B>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Small heart had Harriet for visiting.&nbsp; Only half an hour before

her



<P>friend called for her at Mrs. Goddard's, her evil stars had led



<P>her to the very spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to



<P>The Rev. Philip Elton, White-Hart, Bath, was to be seen under the



<P>operation of being lifted into the butcher's cart, which was to



<P>convey it to where the coaches past; and every thing in this world,



<P>excepting that trunk and the direction, was consequently a blank.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she was to



<P>be put down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led



<P>between espalier apple-trees to the front door, the sight of every



<P>thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before,



<P>was beginning to revive a little local agitation; and when they parted,



<P>Emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity,



<P>which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed



<P>quarter of an hour.&nbsp; She went on herself, to give that portion



<P>of time to an old servant who was married, and settled in Donwell.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again;



<P>and Miss Smith receiving her summons, was with her without delay,



<P>and unattended by any alarming young man.&nbsp; She came solitarily



<P>down the gravel walk--a Miss Martin just appearing at the door,



<P>and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account.



<P>She was feeling too much; but at last Emma collected from her



<P>enough to understand the sort of meeting, and the sort of pain it



<P>was creating.&nbsp; She had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls.



<P>They had received her doubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing



<P>beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time--



<P>till just at last, when Mrs. Martin's saying, all of a sudden,



<P>that she thought Miss Smith was grown, had brought on a more



<P>interesting subject, and a warmer manner.&nbsp; In that very room



<P>she had been measured last September, with her two friends.



<P>There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by



<P>the window.&nbsp; He had done it.&nbsp; They all seemed to remember

the day,



<P>the hour, the party, the occasion--to feel the same consciousness,



<P>the same regrets--to be ready to return to the same good understanding;



<P>and they were just growing again like themselves, (Harriet, as Emma



<P>must suspect, as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy,)



<P>when the carriage reappeared, and all was over.&nbsp; The style of



<P>the visit, and the shortness of it, were then felt to be decisive.



<P>Fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully



<P>passed six weeks not six months ago!--Emma could not but picture



<P>it all, and feel how justly they might resent, how naturally



<P>Harriet must suffer.&nbsp; It was a bad business.&nbsp; She would have

given



<P>a great deal, or endured a great deal, to have had the Martins



<P>in a higher rank of life.&nbsp; They were so deserving, that a little



<P>higher should have been enough:&nbsp; but as it was, how could she have



<P>done otherwise?--Impossible!--She could not repent.&nbsp; They must



<P>be separated; but there was a great deal of pain in the process--



<P>so much to herself at this time, that she soon felt the necessity



<P>of a little consolation, and resolved on going home by way of Randalls



<P>to procure it.&nbsp; Her mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins.



<P>The refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard



<P>that neither "master nor mistress was at home;" they had both



<P>been out some time; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This is too bad," cried Emma, as they turned away.&nbsp; "And now we



<P>shall just miss them; too provoking!--I do not know when I have been



<P>so disappointed."&nbsp; And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge



<P>her murmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both--



<P>such being the commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind.



<P>Presently the carriage stopt; she looked up; it was stopt



<P>by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who were standing to speak to her.



<P>There was instant pleasure in the sight of them, and still greater



<P>pleasure was conveyed in sound--for Mr. Weston immediately accosted



<P>her with,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How d'ye do?--how d'ye do?--We have been sitting with your father--



<P>glad to see him so well.&nbsp; Frank comes to-morrow--I had a letter



<P>this morning--we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty--



<P>he is at Oxford to-day, and he comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it

would



<P>be so.&nbsp; If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three

days;



<P>I was always glad he did not come at Christmas; now we are going



<P>to have just the right weather for him, fine, dry, settled weather.



<P>We shall enjoy him completely; every thing has turned out exactly



<P>as we could wish."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the



<P>influence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston's, confirmed as it all



<P>was by the words and the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter,



<P>but not less to the purpose.&nbsp; To know that she thought his coming



<P>certain was enough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did



<P>she rejoice in their joy.&nbsp; It was a most delightful reanimation



<P>of exhausted spirits.&nbsp; The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness



<P>of what was coming; and in the rapidity of half a moment's thought,



<P>she hoped Mr. Elton would now be talked of no more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe,



<P>which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at



<P>his command, as well as the route and the method of his journey;



<P>and she listened, and smiled, and congratulated.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield," said he, at the conclusion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech,



<P>from his wife.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We had better move on, Mr. Weston," said she, "we are detaining



<P>the girls."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, well, I am ready;"--and turning again to Emma, "but you must



<P>not be expecting such a very fine young man; you have only had my



<P>account you know; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary:"--



<P>though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very



<P>different conviction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer



<P>in a manner that appropriated nothing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o'clock,"



<P>was Mrs. Weston's parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety,



<P>and meant only for her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Four o'clock!--depend upon it he will be here by three," was Mr. Weston's



<P>quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting.



<P>Emma's spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore



<P>a different air; James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish



<P>as before.&nbsp; When she looked at the hedges, she thought the elder

at



<P>least must soon be coming out; and when she turned round to Harriet,



<P>she saw something like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?"--



<P>was a question, however, which did not augur much.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once,



<P>and Emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come



<P>in time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston's



<P>faithful pupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve



<P>o'clock, that she was to think of her at four.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear, dear anxious friend,"--said she, in mental soliloquy,



<P>while walking downstairs from her own room, "always overcareful



<P>for every body's comfort but your own; I see you now in all your



<P>little fidgets, going again and again into his room, to be sure



<P>that all is right."&nbsp; The clock struck twelve as she passed through



<P>the hall.&nbsp; "'Tis twelve; I shall not forget to think of you four



<P>hours hence; and by this time to-morrow, perhaps, or a little later,



<P>I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here.



<P>I am sure they will bring him soon."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with



<P>her father--Mr. Weston and his son.&nbsp; They had been arrived only



<P>a few minutes, and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation



<P>of Frank's being a day before his time, and her father was yet



<P>in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations, when



<P>she appeared, to have her share of surprize, introduction, and pleasure.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest,



<P>was actually before her--he was presented to her, and she did



<P>not think too much had been said in his praise; he was a very good



<P>looking young man; height, air, address, all were unexceptionable,



<P>and his countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness



<P>of his father's; he looked quick and sensible.&nbsp; She felt immediately



<P>that she should like him; and there was a well-bred ease of manner,



<P>and a readiness to talk, which convinced her that he came intending



<P>to be acquainted with her, and that acquainted they soon must be.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had reached Randalls the evening before.&nbsp; She was pleased



<P>with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan,



<P>and travel earlier, later, and quicker, that he might gain half



<P>a day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I told you yesterday," cried Mr. Weston with exultation, "I told



<P>you all that he would be here before the time named.&nbsp; I remembered



<P>what I used to do myself.&nbsp; One cannot creep upon a journey;



<P>one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned; and the



<P>pleasure of coming in upon one's friends before the look-out begins,



<P>is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it," said the young

man,



<P>"though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far;



<P>but in coming home I felt I might do any thing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The word home made his father look on him with fresh complacency.



<P>Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable;



<P>the conviction was strengthened by what followed.&nbsp; He was very

much



<P>pleased with Randalls, thought it a most admirably arranged house,



<P>would hardly allow it even to be very small, admired the situation,



<P>the walk to Highbury, Highbury itself, Hartfield still more,



<P>and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest



<P>in the country which none but one's own country gives, and the



<P>greatest curiosity to visit it.&nbsp; That he should never have been



<P>able to indulge so amiable a feeling before, passed suspiciously



<P>through Emma's brain; but still, if it were a falsehood, it was a



<P>pleasant one, and pleasantly handled.&nbsp; His manner had no air of

study



<P>or exaggeration.&nbsp; He did really look and speak as if in a state

of no



<P>common enjoyment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance.



<P>On his side were the inquiries,--"Was she a horsewoman?--Pleasant rides?--



<P>Pleasant walks?--Had they a large neighbourhood?--Highbury, perhaps,



<P>afforded society enough?--There were several very pretty houses



<P>in and about it.--Balls--had they balls?--Was it a musical society?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintance



<P>proportionably advanced, he contrived to find an opportunity,



<P>while their two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing



<P>his mother-in-law, and speaking of her with so much handsome praise,



<P>so much warm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she



<P>secured to his father, and her very kind reception of himself,



<P>as was an additional proof of his knowing how to please--



<P>and of his certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her.



<P>He did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be



<P>thoroughly deserved by Mrs. Weston; but, undoubtedly he could know



<P>very little of the matter.&nbsp; He understood what would be welcome;



<P>he could be sure of little else.&nbsp; "His father's marriage," he said,



<P>"had been the wisest measure, every friend must rejoice in it;



<P>and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must



<P>be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation



<P>on him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor's merits,



<P>without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things

it



<P>was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse's



<P>character, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor's. And at last, as if resolved



<P>to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object,

he



<P>wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for," said he;



<P>"but I confess that, considering every thing, I had not expected



<P>more than a very tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age;



<P>I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings,"



<P>said Emma; "were you to guess her to be eighteen, I should listen



<P>with pleasure; but she would be ready to quarrel with you for using



<P>such words.&nbsp; Don't let her imagine that you have spoken of her

as



<P>a pretty young woman."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hope I should know better," he replied; "no, depend upon it,



<P>(with a gallant bow,) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should



<P>understand whom I might praise without any danger of being thought



<P>extravagant in my terms."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected



<P>from their knowing each other, which had taken strong possession



<P>of her mind, had ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were



<P>to be considered as marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance.



<P>She must see more of him to understand his ways; at present she



<P>only felt they were agreeable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about.



<P>His quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them



<P>with a happy expression; and even, when he might have determined not



<P>to look, she was confident that he was often listening.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her own father's perfect exemption from any thought of the kind,



<P>the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration



<P>or suspicion, was a most comfortable circumstance.&nbsp; Happily he



<P>was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it.--



<P>Though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged,



<P>he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any;



<P>it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons'



<P>understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were



<P>proved against them.&nbsp; She blessed the favouring blindness.



<P>He could now, without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise,



<P>without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest,



<P>give way to all his natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous



<P>inquiries after Mr. Frank Churchill's accommodation on his journey,



<P>through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road, and express



<P>very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped



<P>catching cold--which, however, he could not allow him to feel quite



<P>assured of himself till after another night.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A reasonable visit paid, Mr. Weston began to move.--"He must be going.



<P>He had business at the Crown about his hay, and a great many errands



<P>for Mrs. Weston at Ford's, but he need not hurry any body else."



<P>His son, too well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also,



<P>saying,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"As you are going farther on business, sir, I will take the



<P>opportunity of paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other,



<P>and therefore may as well be paid now.&nbsp; I have the honour of being



<P>acquainted with a neighbour of yours, (turning to Emma,) a lady



<P>residing in or near Highbury; a family of the name of Fairfax.



<P>I shall have no difficulty, I suppose, in finding the house;



<P>though Fairfax, I believe, is not the proper name--I should rather



<P>say Barnes, or Bates.&nbsp; Do you know any family of that name?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To be sure we do," cried his father; "Mrs. Bates--we passed her house--



<P>I saw Miss Bates at the window.&nbsp; True, true, you are acquainted



<P>with Miss Fairfax; I remember you knew her at Weymouth, and a fine



<P>girl she is.&nbsp; Call upon her, by all means."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is no necessity for my calling this morning," said the



<P>young man; "another day would do as well; but there was that degree



<P>of acquaintance at Weymouth which--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it.&nbsp; What is right to be

done



<P>cannot be done too soon.&nbsp; And, besides, I must give you a hint,

Frank;



<P>any want of attention to her here should be carefully avoided.



<P>You saw her with the Campbells, when she was the equal of every body



<P>she mixed with, but here she is with a poor old grandmother,



<P>who has barely enough to live on.&nbsp; If you do not call early it



<P>will be a slight."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The son looked convinced.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have heard her speak of the acquaintance," said Emma; "she is



<P>a very elegant young woman."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He agreed to it, but with so quiet a "Yes," as inclined her almost



<P>to doubt his real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinct



<P>sort of elegance for the fashionable world, if Jane Fairfax could



<P>be thought only ordinarily gifted with it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If you were never particularly struck by her manners before,"



<P>said she, "I think you will to-day. You will see her to advantage;



<P>see her and hear her--no, I am afraid you will not hear her at all,



<P>for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?"



<P>said Mr. Woodhouse, always the last to make his way in conversation;



<P>"then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very



<P>agreeable young lady.&nbsp; She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama



<P>and aunt, very worthy people; I have known them all my life.



<P>They will be extremely glad to see you, I am sure; and one of my



<P>servants shall go with you to shew you the way."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But your father is not going so far; he is only going to the Crown,



<P>quite on the other side of the street, and there are a great many houses;



<P>you might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk,



<P>unless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you



<P>where you had best cross the street."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as he could,



<P>and his father gave his hearty support by calling out, "My good friend,



<P>this is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water when he



<P>sees it, and as to Mrs. Bates's, he may get there from the Crown



<P>in a hop, step, and jump."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one,



<P>and a graceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave.



<P>Emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance,



<P>and could now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of



<P>the day, with full confidence in their comfort.

<B>CHAPTER XIII</B>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love.&nbsp; Her

ideas



<P>only varied as to the how much.&nbsp; At first, she thought it was a

good deal;



<P>and afterwards, but little.&nbsp; She had great pleasure in hearing

Frank



<P>Churchill talked of; and, for his sake, greater pleasure than ever



<P>in seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston; she was very often thinking of him,



<P>and quite impatient for a letter, that she might know how he was,



<P>how were his spirits, how was his aunt, and what was the chance



<P>of his coming to Randalls again this spring.&nbsp; But, on the other

hand,



<P>she could not admit herself to be unhappy, nor, after the



<P>first morning, to be less disposed for employment than usual;



<P>she was still busy and cheerful; and, pleasing as he was, she could



<P>yet imagine him to have faults; and farther, though thinking of him



<P>so much, and, as she sat drawing or working, forming a thousand



<P>amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment,



<P>fancying interesting dialogues, and inventing elegant letters;



<P>the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she



<P>refused him.&nbsp; Their affection was always to subside into friendship.



<P>Every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting;



<P>but still they were to part.&nbsp; When she became sensible of this,



<P>it struck her that she could not be very much in love; for in spite



<P>of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father,



<P>never to marry, a strong attachment certainly must produce more



<P>of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not find myself making any use of the word sacrifice," said she.--



<P>"In not one of all my clever replies, my delicate negatives,



<P>is there any allusion to making a sacrifice.&nbsp; I do suspect that

he



<P>is not really necessary to my happiness.&nbsp; So much the better.



<P>I certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than I do.&nbsp; I

am



<P>quite enough in love.&nbsp; I should be sorry to be more."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Upon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his feelings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He is undoubtedly very much in love--every thing denotes it--very much



<P>in love indeed!--and when he comes again, if his affection continue,



<P>I must be on my guard not to encourage it.--It would be most



<P>inexcusable to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up.



<P>Not that I imagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto.



<P>No, if he had believed me at all to share his feelings, he would



<P>not have been so wretched.&nbsp; Could he have thought himself encouraged,



<P>his looks and language at parting would have been different.--



<P>Still, however, I must be on my guard.&nbsp; This is in the supposition



<P>of his attachment continuing what it now is; but I do not know that

I



<P>expect it will; I do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man--



<P>I do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy.--



<P>His feelings are warm, but I can imagine them rather changeable.--



<P>Every consideration of the subject, in short, makes me thankful



<P>that my happiness is not more deeply involved.--I shall do very well



<P>again after a little while--and then, it will be a good thing over;



<P>for they say every body is in love once in their lives, and I shall



<P>have been let off easily."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it;



<P>and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made



<P>her at first shake her head over her own sensations, and think she



<P>had undervalued their strength.&nbsp; It was a long, well-written letter,



<P>giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings,



<P>expressing all the affection, gratitude, and respect which was



<P>natural and honourable, and describing every thing exterior and local



<P>that could be supposed attractive, with spirit and precision.



<P>No suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern; it was the



<P>language of real feeling towards Mrs. Weston; and the transition



<P>from Highbury to Enscombe, the contrast between the places in some



<P>of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on



<P>to shew how keenly it was felt, and how much more might have been



<P>said but for the restraints of propriety.--The charm of her own



<P>name was not wanting.&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse appeared more than once,



<P>and never without a something of pleasing connexion, either a



<P>compliment to her taste, or a remembrance of what she had said;



<P>and in the very last time of its meeting her eye, unadorned as it



<P>was by any such broad wreath of gallantry, she yet could discern



<P>the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment



<P>perhaps of all conveyed.&nbsp; Compressed into the very lowest vacant



<P>corner were these words--"I had not a spare moment on Tuesday,



<P>as you know, for Miss Woodhouse's beautiful little friend.&nbsp; Pray

make



<P>my excuses and adieus to her."&nbsp; This, Emma could not doubt, was

all



<P>for herself.&nbsp; Harriet was remembered only from being her friend.



<P>His information and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor



<P>better than had been anticipated; Mrs. Churchill was recovering,



<P>and he dared not yet, even in his own imagination, fix a time for



<P>coming to Randalls again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Gratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the



<P>material part, its sentiments, she yet found, when it was folded up



<P>and returned to Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth,



<P>that she could still do without the writer, and that he must learn



<P>to do without her.&nbsp; Her intentions were unchanged.&nbsp; Her resolution



<P>of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for



<P>his subsequent consolation and happiness.&nbsp; His recollection of

Harriet,



<P>and the words which clothed it, the "beautiful little friend,"



<P>suggested to her the idea of Harriet's succeeding her in his affections.



<P>Was it impossible?--No.--Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his



<P>inferior in understanding; but he had been very much struck with



<P>the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner;



<P>and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in



<P>her favour.--For Harriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I must not dwell upon it," said she.--"I must not think of it.



<P>I know the danger of indulging such speculations.&nbsp; But stranger



<P>things have happened; and when we cease to care for each other



<P>as we do now, it will be the means of confirming us in that sort



<P>of true disinterested friendship which I can already look forward



<P>to with pleasure."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet's behalf,



<P>though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil



<P>in that quarter was at hand.&nbsp; As Frank Churchill's arrival had



<P>succeeded Mr. Elton's engagement in the conversation of Highbury,



<P>as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first, so now



<P>upon Frank Churchill's disappearance, Mr. Elton's concerns were



<P>assuming the most irresistible form.--His wedding-day was named.



<P>He would soon be among them again; Mr. Elton and his bride.



<P>There was hardly time to talk over the first letter from Enscombe



<P>before "Mr. Elton and his bride" was in every body's mouth,



<P>and Frank Churchill was forgotten.&nbsp; Emma grew sick at the sound.



<P>She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr. Elton;



<P>and Harriet's mind, she had been willing to hope, had been lately



<P>gaining strength.&nbsp; With Mr. Weston's ball in view at least,



<P>there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things;



<P>but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state



<P>of composure as could stand against the actual approach--new carriage,



<P>bell-ringing, and all.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the



<P>reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma



<P>could give.&nbsp; Emma felt that she could not do too much for her,



<P>that Harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience;



<P>but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing



<P>any effect, for ever agreed to, without being able to make their opinions



<P>the same.&nbsp; Harriet listened submissively, and said "it was very

true--



<P>it was just as Miss Woodhouse described--it was not worth while to



<P>think about them--and she would not think about them any longer"



<P>but no change of subject could avail, and the next half-hour



<P>saw her as anxious and restless about the Eltons as before.



<P>At last Emma attacked her on another ground.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about



<P>Mr. Elton's marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can



<P>make me.&nbsp; You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake

I



<P>fell into.&nbsp; It was all my doing, I know.&nbsp; I have not forgotten

it,



<P>I assure you.--Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you--



<P>and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever.&nbsp; Do not imagine



<P>me in danger of forgetting it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words



<P>of eager exclamation.&nbsp; Emma continued,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less,



<P>talk less of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather,



<P>I would wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important



<P>than my comfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration



<P>of what is your duty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour



<P>to avoid the suspicions of others, to save your health and credit,



<P>and restore your tranquillity.&nbsp; These are the motives which I



<P>have been pressing on you.&nbsp; They are very important--and sorry



<P>I am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them.



<P>My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration.&nbsp; I

want



<P>you to save yourself from greater pain.&nbsp; Perhaps I may sometimes



<P>have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due--or rather



<P>what would be kind by me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest.



<P>The idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse,



<P>whom she really loved extremely, made her wretched for a while,



<P>and when the violence of grief was comforted away, still remained



<P>powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it



<P>very tolerably.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life--



<P>Want gratitude to you!--Nobody is equal to you!--I care for nobody



<P>as I do for you!--Oh!&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Such expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look



<P>and manner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet



<P>so well, nor valued her affection so highly before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart," said she



<P>afterwards to herself.&nbsp; "There is nothing to be compared to it.



<P>Warmth and tenderness of heart, with an affectionate, open manner,



<P>will beat all the clearness of head in the world, for attraction,



<P>I am sure it will.&nbsp; It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear



<P>father so generally beloved--which gives Isabella all her popularity.--



<P>I have it not--but I know how to prize and respect it.--Harriet is



<P>my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives.



<P>Dear Harriet!--I would not change you for the clearest-headed,



<P>longest-sighted, best-judging female breathing.&nbsp; Oh! the coldness



<P>of a Jane Fairfax!--Harriet is worth a hundred such--And for a wife--



<P>a sensible man's wife--it is invaluable.&nbsp; I mention no names;



<P>but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet!"

<B>CHAPTER VII</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Emma's very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken



<P>the following day, by hearing that he was gone off to London,



<P>merely to have his hair cut.&nbsp; A sudden freak seemed to have seized

him



<P>at breakfast, and he had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to



<P>return to dinner, but with no more important view that appeared than



<P>having his hair cut.&nbsp; There was certainly no harm in his travelling



<P>sixteen miles twice over on such an errand; but there was an air



<P>of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve.&nbsp; It

did



<P>not accord with the rationality of plan, the moderation in expense,



<P>or even the unselfish warmth of heart, which she had believed herself



<P>to discern in him yesterday.&nbsp; Vanity, extravagance, love of change,



<P>restlessness of temper, which must be doing something, good or bad;



<P>heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston,



<P>indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general; he became



<P>liable to all these charges.&nbsp; His father only called him a coxcomb,



<P>and thought it a very good story; but that Mrs. Weston did not like

it,



<P>was clear enough, by her passing it over as quickly as possible,



<P>and making no other comment than that "all young people would have



<P>their little whims."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit



<P>hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston



<P>was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he



<P>made himself--how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether.



<P>He appeared to have a very open temper--certainly a very cheerful



<P>and lively one; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions,



<P>a great deal decidedly right; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard,



<P>was fond of talking of him--said he would be the best man in the



<P>world if he were left to himself; and though there was no being



<P>attached to the aunt, he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude,



<P>and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect.



<P>This was all very promising; and, but for such an unfortunate fancy



<P>for having his hair cut, there was nothing to denote him unworthy



<P>of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him;



<P>the honour, if not of being really in love with her, of being



<P>at least very near it, and saved only by her own indifference--



<P>(for still her resolution held of never marrying)--the honour, in short,



<P>of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Weston, on his side, added a virtue to the account which must



<P>have some weight.&nbsp; He gave her to understand that Frank admired



<P>her extremely--thought her very beautiful and very charming;



<P>and with so much to be said for him altogether, she found she must



<P>not judge him harshly.&nbsp; As Mrs. Weston observed, "all young people



<P>would have their little whims."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so



<P>leniently disposed.&nbsp; In general he was judged, throughout the parishes



<P>of Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances



<P>were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man--



<P>one who smiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit



<P>among them not to be softened, from its power of censure, by bows



<P>or smiles--Mr. Knightley.&nbsp; The circumstance was told him at Hartfield;



<P>for the moment, he was silent; but Emma heard him almost immediately



<P>afterwards say to himself, over a newspaper he held in his hand,



<P>"Hum! just the trifling, silly fellow I took him for."&nbsp; She had



<P>half a mind to resent; but an instant's observation convinced



<P>her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings,



<P>and not meant to provoke; and therefore she let it pass.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings,



<P>Mr. and Mrs. Weston's visit this morning was in another respect



<P>particularly opportune.&nbsp; Something occurred while they were



<P>at Hartfield, to make Emma want their advice; and, which was



<P>still more lucky, she wanted exactly the advice they gave.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was the occurrence:--The Coles had been settled some years



<P>in Highbury, and were very good sort of people--friendly, liberal,



<P>and unpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin,



<P>in trade, and only moderately genteel.&nbsp; On their first coming into



<P>the country, they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly,



<P>keeping little company, and that little unexpensively; but the last



<P>year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means--



<P>the house in town had yielded greater profits, and fortune in general



<P>had smiled on them.&nbsp; With their wealth, their views increased;



<P>their want of a larger house, their inclination for more company.



<P>They added to their house, to their number of servants,



<P>to their expenses of every sort; and by this time were, in fortune



<P>and style of living, second only to the family at Hartfield.



<P>Their love of society, and their new dining-room, prepared every body



<P>for their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly among



<P>the single men, had already taken place.&nbsp; The regular and best



<P>families Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite--



<P>neither Donwell, nor Hartfield, nor Randalls.&nbsp; Nothing should



<P>tempt her to go, if they did; and she regretted that her father's



<P>known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she



<P>could wish.&nbsp; The Coles were very respectable in their way, but

they



<P>ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms



<P>on which the superior families would visit them.&nbsp; This lesson,



<P>she very much feared, they would receive only from herself;



<P>she had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many



<P>weeks before it appeared, that when the insult came at last,



<P>it found her very differently affected.&nbsp; Donwell and Randalls



<P>had received their invitation, and none had come for her father



<P>and herself; and Mrs. Weston's accounting for it with "I suppose



<P>they will not take the liberty with you; they know you do not



<P>dine out," was not quite sufficient.&nbsp; She felt that she should



<P>like to have had the power of refusal; and afterwards, as the idea



<P>of the party to be assembled there, consisting precisely of those



<P>whose society was dearest to her, occurred again and again,



<P>she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept.



<P>Harriet was to be there in the evening, and the Bateses.&nbsp; They

had



<P>been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before,



<P>and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence.



<P>Might not the evening end in a dance? had been a question of his.



<P>The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits;



<P>and her being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the omission



<P>to be intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were



<P>at Hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her



<P>first remark, on reading it, was that "of course it must be declined,"



<P>she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do,



<P>that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely



<P>without inclination for the party.&nbsp; The Coles expressed themselves



<P>so properly--there was so much real attention in the manner of it--



<P>so much consideration for her father.&nbsp; "They would have solicited

the



<P>honour earlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen



<P>from London, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught



<P>of air, and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the



<P>honour of his company.&nbsp; "Upon the whole, she was very persuadable;



<P>and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be



<P>done without neglecting his comfort--how certainly Mrs. Goddard,



<P>if not Mrs. Bates, might be depended on for bearing him company--



<P>Mr. Woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter's



<P>going out to dinner on a day now near at hand, and spending



<P>the whole evening away from him.&nbsp; As for his going, Emma did



<P>not wish him to think it possible, the hours would be too late,



<P>and the party too numerous.&nbsp; He was soon pretty well resigned.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am not fond of dinner-visiting," said he--"I never was.



<P>No more is Emma.&nbsp; Late hours do not agree with us.&nbsp; I am sorry



<P>Mr. and Mrs. Cole should have done it.&nbsp; I think it would be



<P>much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer,



<P>and take their tea with us--take us in their afternoon walk;



<P>which they might do, as our hours are so reasonable, and yet get home



<P>without being out in the damp of the evening.&nbsp; The dews of a summer



<P>evening are what I would not expose any body to.&nbsp; However, as they



<P>are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them, and as you



<P>will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to take care of her,



<P>I cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather be what it ought,



<P>neither damp, nor cold, nor windy."&nbsp; Then turning to Mrs. Weston,



<P>with a look of gentle reproach--"Ah!&nbsp; Miss Taylor, if you had



<P>not married, you would have staid at home with me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, sir," cried Mr. Weston, "as I took Miss Taylor away,



<P>it is incumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will



<P>step to Mrs. Goddard in a moment, if you wish it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But the idea of any thing to be done in a moment, was increasing,



<P>not lessening, Mr. Woodhouse's agitation.&nbsp; The ladies knew better



<P>how to allay it.&nbsp; Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing



<P>deliberately arranged.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough



<P>for talking as usual.&nbsp; "He should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard.



<P>He had a great regard for Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line,



<P>and invite her.&nbsp; James could take the note.&nbsp; But first of

all,



<P>there must be an answer written to Mrs. Cole."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible.&nbsp; You

will



<P>say that I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore must



<P>decline their obliging invitation; beginning with my compliments,



<P>of course.&nbsp; But you will do every thing right.&nbsp; I need not

tell you



<P>what is to be done.&nbsp; We must remember to let James know that the

carriage



<P>will be wanted on Tuesday.&nbsp; I shall have no fears for you with

him.



<P>We have never been there above once since the new approach was made;



<P>but still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely.



<P>And when you get there, you must tell him at what time you would



<P>have him come for you again; and you had better name an early hour.



<P>You will not like staying late.&nbsp; You will get very tired when tea



<P>is over."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired.&nbsp; There will be



<P>a great many people talking at once.&nbsp; You will not like the noise."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But, my dear sir," cried Mr. Weston, "if Emma comes away early,



<P>it will be breaking up the party."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And no great harm if it does," said Mr. Woodhouse.&nbsp; "The sooner



<P>every party breaks up, the better."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles.



<P>Emma's going away directly after tea might be giving offence.



<P>They are good-natured people, and think little of their own claims;



<P>but still they must feel that any body's hurrying away is no



<P>great compliment; and Miss Woodhouse's doing it would be more thought



<P>of than any other person's in the room.&nbsp; You would not wish to

disappoint



<P>and mortify the Coles, I am sure, sir; friendly, good sort of people



<P>as ever lived, and who have been your neighbours these ten years."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged



<P>to you for reminding me.&nbsp; I should be extremely sorry to be giving



<P>them any pain.&nbsp; I know what worthy people they are.&nbsp; Perry

tells



<P>me that Mr. Cole never touches malt liquor.&nbsp; You would not think



<P>it to look at him, but he is bilious--Mr. Cole is very bilious.



<P>No, I would not be the means of giving them any pain.&nbsp; My dear

Emma,



<P>we must consider this.&nbsp; I am sure, rather than run the risk of

hurting



<P>Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay a little longer than you might wish.



<P>You will not regard being tired.&nbsp; You will be perfectly safe,



<P>you know, among your friends."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh yes, papa.&nbsp; I have no fears at all for myself; and I should

have



<P>no scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account.



<P>I am only afraid of your sitting up for me.&nbsp; I am not afraid



<P>of your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard.



<P>She loves piquet, you know; but when she is gone home, I am afraid



<P>you will be sitting up by yourself, instead of going to bed at your



<P>usual time--and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort.



<P>You must promise me not to sit up."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He did, on the condition of some promises on her side:&nbsp; such as

that,



<P>if she came home cold, she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly;



<P>if hungry, that she would take something to eat; that her own maid



<P>should sit up for her; and that Serle and the butler should see



<P>that every thing were safe in the house, as usual.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>The next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again.&nbsp; He came with



<P>Mrs. Weston, to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially.



<P>He had been sitting with her, it appeared, most companionably at home,



<P>till her usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse



<P>their walk, immediately fixed on Highbury.--"He did not doubt there



<P>being very pleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him,



<P>he should always chuse the same.&nbsp; Highbury, that airy, cheerful,



<P>happy-looking Highbury, would be his constant attraction."--



<P>Highbury, with Mrs. Weston, stood for Hartfield; and she trusted to



<P>its bearing the same construction with him.&nbsp; They walked thither

directly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma had hardly expected them:&nbsp; for Mr. Weston, who had called

in



<P>for half a minute, in order to hear that his son was very handsome,



<P>knew nothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize



<P>to her, therefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together,



<P>arm in arm.&nbsp; She was wanting to see him again, and especially



<P>to see him in company with Mrs. Weston, upon his behaviour to whom



<P>her opinion of him was to depend.&nbsp; If he were deficient there,



<P>nothing should make amends for it.&nbsp; But on seeing them together,



<P>she became perfectly satisfied.&nbsp; It was not merely in fine words



<P>or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty; nothing could be



<P>more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her--nothing could



<P>more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and



<P>securing her affection.&nbsp; And there was time enough for Emma to

form a



<P>reasonable judgment, as their visit included all the rest of the morning.



<P>They were all three walking about together for an hour or two--



<P>first round the shrubberies of Hartfield, and afterwards in Highbury.



<P>He was delighted with every thing; admired Hartfield sufficiently



<P>for Mr. Woodhouse's ear; and when their going farther was resolved on,



<P>confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village,



<P>and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than Emma



<P>could have supposed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings.



<P>He begged to be shewn the house which his father had lived in so long,



<P>and which had been the home of his father's father; and on recollecting



<P>that an old woman who had nursed him was still living, walked in quest



<P>of her cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though



<P>in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit,



<P>they shewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general,



<P>which must be very like a merit to those he was with.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn,



<P>it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily



<P>absenting himself; that he had not been acting a part, or making



<P>a parade of insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly



<P>had not done him justice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Their first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house,



<P>though the principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of



<P>post-horses were kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood



<P>than from any run on the road; and his companions had not expected



<P>to be detained by any interest excited there; but in passing it they



<P>gave the history of the large room visibly added; it had been built



<P>many years ago for a ball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been



<P>in a particularly populous, dancing state, had been occasionally used



<P>as such;--but such brilliant days had long passed away, and now the



<P>highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist



<P>club established among the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place.



<P>He was immediately interested.&nbsp; Its character as a ball-room caught

him;



<P>and instead of passing on, he stopt for several minutes at the two



<P>superior sashed windows which were open, to look in and contemplate



<P>its capabilities, and lament that its original purpose should



<P>have ceased.&nbsp; He saw no fault in the room, he would acknowledge



<P>none which they suggested.&nbsp; No, it was long enough, broad enough,



<P>handsome enough.&nbsp; It would hold the very number for comfort.



<P>They ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through



<P>the winter.&nbsp; Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the former good



<P>old days of the room?--She who could do any thing in Highbury!



<P>The want of proper families in the place, and the conviction



<P>that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be



<P>tempted to attend, were mentioned; but he was not satisfied.



<P>He could not be persuaded that so many good-looking houses as he saw



<P>around him, could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting;



<P>and even when particulars were given and families described, he was



<P>still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture



<P>would be any thing, or that there would be the smallest difficulty



<P>in every body's returning into their proper place the next morning.



<P>He argued like a young man very much bent on dancing; and Emma



<P>was rather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail



<P>so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills.&nbsp; He seemed to

have



<P>all the life and spirit, cheerful feelings, and social inclinations



<P>of his father, and nothing of the pride or reserve of Enscombe.



<P>Of pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his indifference



<P>to a confusion of rank, bordered too much on inelegance of mind.



<P>He could be no judge, however, of the evil he was holding cheap.



<P>It was but an effusion of lively spirits.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown;



<P>and being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged,



<P>Emma recollected his intended visit the day before, and asked him



<P>if he had paid it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, oh! yes"--he replied; "I was just going to mention it.



<P>A very successful visit:--I saw all the three ladies; and felt very



<P>much obliged to you for your preparatory hint.&nbsp; If the talking

aunt



<P>had taken me quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me.



<P>As it was, I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit.



<P>Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that



<P>was proper; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home



<P>before him--but there was no getting away, no pause; and, to my



<P>utter astonishment, I found, when he (finding me nowhere else)



<P>joined me there at last, that I had been actually sitting with them



<P>very nearly three-quarters of an hour.&nbsp; The good lady had not given

me



<P>the possibility of escape before."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ill, very ill--that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look

ill.



<P>But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it?



<P>Ladies can never look ill.&nbsp; And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally



<P>so pale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill health.--



<P>A most deplorable want of complexion."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss



<P>Fairfax's complexion.&nbsp; "It was certainly never brilliant, but she



<P>would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was



<P>a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance



<P>to the character of her face."&nbsp; He listened with all due deference;



<P>acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same--but yet he



<P>must confess, that to him nothing could make amends for the want



<P>of the fine glow of health.&nbsp; Where features were indifferent,



<P>a fine complexion gave beauty to them all; and where they were good,



<P>the effect was--fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the



<P>effect was.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well," said Emma, "there is no disputing about taste.--At least



<P>you admire her except her complexion."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He shook his head and laughed.--"I cannot separate Miss Fairfax



<P>and her complexion."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Did you see her often at Weymouth?&nbsp; Were you often in the same

society?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At this moment they were approaching Ford's, and he hastily exclaimed,



<P>"Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day



<P>of their lives, as my father informs me.&nbsp; He comes to Highbury

himself,



<P>he says, six days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford's.



<P>If it be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I may prove



<P>myself to belong to the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury.



<P>I must buy something at Ford's. It will be taking out my freedom.--



<P>I dare say they sell gloves."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! yes, gloves and every thing.&nbsp; I do admire your patriotism.



<P>You will be adored in Highbury.&nbsp; You were very popular before you

came,



<P>because you were Mr. Weston's son--but lay out half a guinea at



<P>Ford's, and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of "Men's Beavers"



<P>and "York Tan" were bringing down and displaying on the counter,



<P>he said--"But I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you were speaking



<P>to me, you were saying something at the very moment of this burst



<P>of my amor patriae.&nbsp; Do not let me lose it.&nbsp; I assure you

the utmost



<P>stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any



<P>happiness in private life."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax



<P>and her party at Weymouth."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to be

a



<P>very unfair one.&nbsp; It is always the lady's right to decide on the

degree



<P>of acquaintance.&nbsp; Miss Fairfax must already have given her account.--



<P>I shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she could do herself.



<P>But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed,



<P>she is so very reserved, so very unwilling to give the least



<P>information about any body, that I really think you may say what you



<P>like of your acquaintance with her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"May I, indeed?--Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me



<P>so well.&nbsp; I met her frequently at Weymouth.&nbsp; I had known the

Campbells



<P>a little in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set.



<P>Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly,



<P>warm-hearted woman.&nbsp; I like them all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You know Miss Fairfax's situation in life, I conclude; what she



<P>is destined to be?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes--(rather hesitatingly)--I believe I do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You get upon delicate subjects, Emma," said Mrs. Weston smiling;



<P>"remember that I am here.--Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows



<P>what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax's situation in life.



<P>I will move a little farther off."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I certainly do forget to think of her," said Emma, "as having ever



<P>been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop again,



<P>"Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?"



<P>said Frank Churchill.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ever hear her!" repeated Emma.&nbsp; "You forget how much she belongs



<P>to Highbury.&nbsp; I have heard her every year of our lives since we



<P>both began.&nbsp; She plays charmingly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You think so, do you?--I wanted the opinion of some one who



<P>could really judge.&nbsp; She appeared to me to play well, that is,



<P>with considerable taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.--



<P>I am excessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill



<P>or right of judging of any body's performance.--I have been used



<P>to hear her's admired; and I remember one proof of her being



<P>thought to play well:--a man, a very musical man, and in love



<P>with another woman--engaged to her--on the point of marriage--



<P>would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument,



<P>if the lady in question could sit down instead--never seemed



<P>to like to hear one if he could hear the other.&nbsp; That, I thought,



<P>in a man of known musical talent, was some proof."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Proof indeed!" said Emma, highly amused.--"Mr. Dixon is very musical,



<P>is he?&nbsp; We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from

you,



<P>than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought



<P>it a very strong proof."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Certainly--very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal



<P>stronger than, if I had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all



<P>agreeable to me.&nbsp; I could not excuse a man's having more music



<P>than love--more ear than eye--a more acute sensibility to fine



<P>sounds than to my feelings.&nbsp; How did Miss Campbell appear to like

it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It was her very particular friend, you know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Poor comfort!" said Emma, laughing.&nbsp; "One would rather have a

stranger



<P>preferred than one's very particular friend--with a stranger it might



<P>not recur again--but the misery of having a very particular friend



<P>always at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!--



<P>Poor Mrs. Dixon!&nbsp; Well, I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are right.&nbsp; It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell;



<P>but she really did not seem to feel it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So much the better--or so much the worse:--I do not know which.



<P>But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her--quickness of friendship,



<P>or dulness of feeling--there was one person, I think, who must have



<P>felt it:&nbsp; Miss Fairfax herself.&nbsp; She must have felt the improper



<P>and dangerous distinction."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"As to that--I do not--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax's



<P>sensations from you, or from any body else.&nbsp; They are known to

no



<P>human being, I guess, but herself.&nbsp; But if she continued to play



<P>whenever she was asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all--"



<P>he began rather quickly, but checking himself, added, "however, it



<P>is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were--



<P>how it might all be behind the scenes.&nbsp; I can only say that there



<P>was smoothness outwardly.&nbsp; But you, who have known Miss Fairfax

from



<P>a child, must be a better judge of her character, and of how she



<P>is likely to conduct herself in critical situations, than I can be."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have known her from a child, undoubtedly; we have been children



<P>and women together; and it is natural to suppose that we should



<P>be intimate,--that we should have taken to each other whenever



<P>she visited her friends.&nbsp; But we never did.&nbsp; I hardly know

how it



<P>has happened; a little, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side



<P>which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized



<P>and so cried up as she always was, by her aunt and grandmother,



<P>and all their set.&nbsp; And then, her reserve--I never could attach



<P>myself to any one so completely reserved."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is a most repulsive quality, indeed," said he.&nbsp; "Oftentimes



<P>very convenient, no doubt, but never pleasing.&nbsp; There is safety



<P>in reserve, but no attraction.&nbsp; One cannot love a reserved person."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attraction



<P>may be the greater.&nbsp; But I must be more in want of a friend,



<P>or an agreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take



<P>the trouble of conquering any body's reserve to procure one.



<P>Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question.



<P>I have no reason to think ill of her--not the least--except that



<P>such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner,



<P>such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body, is apt



<P>to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He perfectly agreed with her:&nbsp; and after walking together so long,



<P>and thinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with

him,



<P>that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting.



<P>He was not exactly what she had expected; less of the man of the



<P>world in some of his notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune,



<P>therefore better than she had expected.&nbsp; His ideas seemed more

moderate--



<P>his feelings warmer.&nbsp; She was particularly struck by his manner



<P>of considering Mr. Elton's house, which, as well as the church,



<P>he would go and look at, and would not join them in finding much



<P>fault with.&nbsp; No, he could not believe it a bad house; not such

a house



<P>as a man was to be pitied for having.&nbsp; If it were to be shared

with



<P>the woman he loved, he could not think any man to be pitied for having



<P>that house.&nbsp; There must be ample room in it for every real comfort.



<P>The man must be a blockhead who wanted more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Weston laughed, and said he did not know what he was talking about.



<P>Used only to a large house himself, and without ever thinking how many



<P>advantages and accommodations were attached to its size, he could



<P>be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one.



<P>But Emma, in her own mind, determined that he did know what he



<P>was talking about, and that he shewed a very amiable inclination



<P>to settle early in life, and to marry, from worthy motives.



<P>He might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be



<P>occasioned by no housekeeper's room, or a bad butler's pantry,



<P>but no doubt he did perfectly feel that Enscombe could not make



<P>him happy, and that whenever he were attached, he would willingly



<P>give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball



<P>completely satisfactory to Emma--its being fixed for a day within



<P>the granted term of Frank Churchill's stay in Surry; for, in spite



<P>of Mr. Weston's confidence, she could not think it so very impossible



<P>that the Churchills might not allow their nephew to remain



<P>a day beyond his fortnight.&nbsp; But this was not judged feasible.



<P>The preparations must take their time, nothing could be properly



<P>ready till the third week were entered on, and for a few days they



<P>must be planning, proceeding and hoping in uncertainty--at the risk--



<P>in her opinion, the great risk, of its being all in vain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Enscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word.



<P>His wish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was



<P>not opposed.&nbsp; All was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of

one



<P>solicitude generally makes way for another, Emma, being now certain



<P>of her ball, began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley's



<P>provoking indifference about it.&nbsp; Either because he did not



<P>dance himself, or because the plan had been formed without his



<P>being consulted, he seemed resolved that it should not interest him,



<P>determined against its exciting any present curiosity, or affording



<P>him any future amusement.&nbsp; To her voluntary communications Emma



<P>could get no more approving reply, than,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very well.&nbsp; If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this



<P>trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing



<P>to say against it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.--



<P>Oh! yes, I must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep



<P>as much awake as I can; but I would rather be at home, looking over



<P>William Larkins's week's account; much rather, I confess.--



<P>Pleasure in seeing dancing!--not I, indeed--I never look at it--



<P>I do not know who does.--Fine dancing, I believe, like virtue,



<P>must be its own reward.&nbsp; Those who are standing by are usually



<P>thinking of something very different."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This Emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry.



<P>It was not in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was



<P>so indifferent, or so indignant; he was not guided by her feelings



<P>in reprobating the ball, for she enjoyed the thought of it



<P>to an extraordinary degree.&nbsp; It made her animated--open hearted--



<P>she voluntarily said;--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh!&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the

ball.



<P>What a disappointment it would be!&nbsp; I do look forward to it, I

own,



<P>with very great pleasure."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have



<P>preferred the society of William Larkins.&nbsp; No!--she was more and

more



<P>convinced that Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise.



<P>There was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment



<P>on his side--but no love.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Alas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley.



<P>Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the



<P>over-throw of every thing.&nbsp; A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill



<P>to urge his nephew's instant return.&nbsp; Mrs. Churchill was unwell--



<P>far too unwell to do without him; she had been in a very suffering



<P>state (so said her husband) when writing to her nephew two days before,



<P>though from her usual unwillingness to give pain, and constant



<P>habit of never thinking of herself, she had not mentioned it;



<P>but now she was too ill to trifle, and must entreat him to set off



<P>for Enscombe without delay.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note



<P>from Mrs. Weston, instantly.&nbsp; As to his going, it was inevitable.



<P>He must be gone within a few hours, though without feeling any real



<P>alarm for his aunt, to lessen his repugnance.&nbsp; He knew her illnesses;



<P>they never occurred but for her own convenience.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Weston added, "that he could only allow himself time to



<P>hurry to Highbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few



<P>friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him;



<P>and that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This wretched note was the finale of Emma's breakfast.&nbsp; When once



<P>it had been read, there was no doing any thing, but lament



<P>and exclaim.&nbsp; The loss of the ball--the loss of the young man--



<P>and all that the young man might be feeling!--It was too wretched!--



<P>Such a delightful evening as it would have been!--Every body so happy!



<P>and she and her partner the happiest!--"I said it would be so,"



<P>was the only consolation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her father's feelings were quite distinct.&nbsp; He thought principally



<P>of Mrs. Churchill's illness, and wanted to know how she was treated;



<P>and as for the ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed;



<P>but they would all be safer at home.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared;



<P>but if this reflected at all upon his impatience, his sorrowful



<P>look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him.



<P>He felt the going away almost too much to speak of it.&nbsp; His dejection



<P>was most evident.&nbsp; He sat really lost in thought for the first



<P>few minutes; and when rousing himself, it was only to say,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But you will come again," said Emma.&nbsp; "This will not be your only



<P>visit to Randalls."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah!--(shaking his head)--the uncertainty of when I may be able



<P>to return!--I shall try for it with a zeal!--It will be the object



<P>of all my thoughts and cares!--and if my uncle and aunt go to town



<P>this spring--but I am afraid--they did not stir last spring--



<P>I am afraid it is a custom gone for ever."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Our poor ball must be quite given up."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! that ball!--why did we wait for any thing?--why not seize the



<P>pleasure at once?--How often is happiness destroyed by preparation,



<P>foolish preparation!--You told us it would be so.--Oh!&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse,



<P>why are you always so right?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance.&nbsp; I would



<P>much rather have been merry than wise."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If I can come again, we are still to have our ball.&nbsp; My father



<P>depends on it.&nbsp; Do not forget your engagement."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma looked graciously.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Such a fortnight as it has been!" he continued; "every day more



<P>precious and more delightful than the day before!--every day making



<P>me less fit to bear any other place.&nbsp; Happy those, who can remain



<P>at Highbury!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"As you do us such ample justice now," said Emma, laughing, "I will



<P>venture to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first?



<P>Do not we rather surpass your expectations?&nbsp; I am sure we do.



<P>I am sure you did not much expect to like us.&nbsp; You would not have

been



<P>so long in coming, if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment,



<P>Emma was convinced that it had been so.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And you must be off this very morning?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes; my father is to join me here:&nbsp; we shall walk back together,



<P>and I must be off immediately.&nbsp; I am almost afraid that every moment



<P>will bring him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and



<P>Miss Bates?&nbsp; How unlucky!&nbsp; Miss Bates's powerful, argumentative

mind



<P>might have strengthened yours."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes--I have called there; passing the door, I thought it better.



<P>It was a right thing to do.&nbsp; I went in for three minutes, and was



<P>detained by Miss Bates's being absent.&nbsp; She was out; and I felt

it



<P>impossible not to wait till she came in.&nbsp; She is a woman that one

may,



<P>that one must laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight.



<P>It was better to pay my visit, then"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He hesitated, got up, walked to a window.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"In short," said he, "perhaps, Miss Woodhouse--I think you can



<P>hardly be quite without suspicion"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts.&nbsp; She hardly



<P>knew what to say.&nbsp; It seemed like the forerunner of something



<P>absolutely serious, which she did not wish.&nbsp; Forcing herself



<P>to speak, therefore, in the hope of putting it by, she calmly said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit,

then"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was silent.&nbsp; She believed he was looking at her; probably reflecting



<P>on what she had said, and trying to understand the manner.



<P>She heard him sigh.&nbsp; It was natural for him to feel that he had



<P>cause to sigh.&nbsp; He could not believe her to be encouraging him.



<P>A few awkward moments passed, and he sat down again; and in a more



<P>determined manner said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be



<P>given to Hartfield.&nbsp; My regard for Hartfield is most warm"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.--



<P>He was more in love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say



<P>how it might have ended, if his father had not made his appearance?



<P>Mr. Woodhouse soon followed; and the necessity of exertion made



<P>him composed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial.



<P>Mr. Weston, always alert when business was to be done, and as



<P>incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable,



<P>as of foreseeing any that was doubtful, said, "It was time to go;"



<P>and the young man, though he might and did sigh, could not but agree,



<P>to take leave.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall hear about you all," said he; that is my chief consolation.



<P>I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you.&nbsp; I have



<P>engaged Mrs. Weston to correspond with me.&nbsp; She has been so kind

as



<P>to promise it.&nbsp; Oh! the blessing of a female correspondent, when

one



<P>is really interested in the absent!--she will tell me every thing.



<P>In her letters I shall be at dear Highbury again."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest "Good-bye,"



<P>closed the speech, and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill.



<P>Short had been the notice--short their meeting; he was gone; and Emma



<P>felt so sorry to part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little



<P>society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry,



<P>and feeling it too much.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was a sad change.&nbsp; They had been meeting almost every day



<P>since his arrival.&nbsp; Certainly his being at Randalls had given



<P>great spirit to the last two weeks--indescribable spirit; the idea,



<P>the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought,



<P>the assurance of his attentions, his liveliness, his manners!



<P>It had been a very happy fortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking



<P>from it into the common course of Hartfield days.&nbsp; To complete

every



<P>other recommendation, he had almost told her that he loved her.



<P>What strength, or what constancy of affection he might be subject to,



<P>was another point; but at present she could not doubt his having



<P>a decidedly warm admiration, a conscious preference of herself;



<P>and this persuasion, joined to all the rest, made her think that



<P>she must be a little in love with him, in spite of every previous



<P>determination against it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I certainly must," said she.&nbsp; "This sensation of listlessness,



<P>weariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ myself,



<P>this feeling of every thing's being dull and insipid about the house!--



<P>I must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I



<P>were not--for a few weeks at least.&nbsp; Well! evil to some is always



<P>good to others.&nbsp; I shall have many fellow-mourners for the ball,



<P>if not for Frank Churchill; but Mr. Knightley will be happy.



<P>He may spend the evening with his dear William Larkins now if he likes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness.&nbsp; He could



<P>not say that he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful look



<P>would have contradicted him if he had; but he said, and very steadily,



<P>that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others, and with



<P>considerable kindness added,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are really



<P>out of luck; you are very much out of luck!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her



<P>honest regret in this woeful change; but when they did meet,



<P>her composure was odious.&nbsp; She had been particularly unwell, however,



<P>suffering from headache to a degree, which made her aunt declare,



<P>that had the ball taken place, she did not think Jane could have



<P>attended it; and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming



<P>indifference to the languor of ill-health.

<B>CHAPTER VIII</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Frank Churchill came back again; and if he kept his father's



<P>dinner waiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston



<P>was too anxious for his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse,



<P>to betray any imperfection which could be concealed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He came back, had had his hair cut, and laughed at himself with



<P>a very good grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed



<P>of what he had done.&nbsp; He had no reason to wish his hair longer,



<P>to conceal any confusion of face; no reason to wish the money unspent,



<P>to improve his spirits.&nbsp; He was quite as undaunted and as lively



<P>as ever; and, after seeing him, Emma thus moralised to herself:--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly things



<P>do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an



<P>impudent way.&nbsp; Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not



<P>always folly.--It depends upon the character of those who handle it.



<P>Mr. Knightley, he is not a trifling, silly young man.&nbsp; If he were,



<P>he would have done this differently.&nbsp; He would either have gloried



<P>in the achievement, or been ashamed of it.&nbsp; There would have been



<P>either the ostentation of a coxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too



<P>weak to defend its own vanities.--No, I am perfectly sure that he



<P>is not trifling or silly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again,



<P>and for a longer time than hitherto; of judging of his general manners,



<P>and by inference, of the meaning of his manners towards herself;



<P>of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness



<P>into her air; and of fancying what the observations of all those



<P>might be, who were now seeing them together for the first time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at



<P>Mr. Cole's; and without being able to forget that among the failings



<P>of Mr. Elton, even in the days of his favour, none had disturbed



<P>her more than his propensity to dine with Mr. Cole.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her father's comfort was amply secured, Mrs. Bates as well as



<P>Mrs. Goddard being able to come; and her last pleasing duty,



<P>before she left the house, was to pay her respects to them as



<P>they sat together after dinner; and while her father was fondly



<P>noticing the beauty of her dress, to make the two ladies all



<P>the amends in her power, by helping them to large slices of cake



<P>and full glasses of wine, for whatever unwilling self-denial his



<P>care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise



<P>during the meal.--She had provided a plentiful dinner for them;



<P>she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She followed another carriage to Mr. Cole's door; and was pleased



<P>to see that it was Mr. Knightley's; for Mr. Knightley keeping



<P>no horses, having little spare money and a great deal of health,



<P>activity, and independence, was too apt, in Emma's opinion, to get



<P>about as he could, and not use his carriage so often as became



<P>the owner of Donwell Abbey.&nbsp; She had an opportunity now of speaking



<P>her approbation while warm from her heart, for he stopped to hand her

out.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This is coming as you should do," said she; "like a gentleman.--



<P>I am quite glad to see you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He thanked her, observing, "How lucky that we should arrive at the same



<P>moment! for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I doubt whether



<P>you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.--



<P>You might not have distinguished how I came, by my look or manner."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes I should, I am sure I should.&nbsp; There is always a look of



<P>consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know



<P>to be beneath them.&nbsp; You think you carry it off very well, I dare

say,



<P>but with you it is a sort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern;



<P>I always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances.



<P>Now you have nothing to try for.&nbsp; You are not afraid of being



<P>supposed ashamed.&nbsp; You are not striving to look taller than any



<P>body else.&nbsp; Now I shall really be very happy to walk into the same



<P>room with you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nonsensical girl!" was his reply, but not at all in anger.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party



<P>as with Mr. Knightley.&nbsp; She was received with a cordial respect



<P>which could not but please, and given all the consequence she could



<P>wish for.&nbsp; When the Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love,



<P>the strongest of admiration were for her, from both husband and wife;



<P>the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked



<P>her as his peculiar object, and at dinner she found him seated



<P>by her--and, as she firmly believed, not without some dexterity



<P>on his side.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The party was rather large, as it included one other family, a proper



<P>unobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the advantage of



<P>naming among their acquaintance, and the male part of Mr. Cox's family,



<P>the lawyer of Highbury.&nbsp; The less worthy females were to come



<P>in the evening, with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith;



<P>but already, at dinner, they were too numerous for any subject



<P>of conversation to be general; and, while politics and Mr. Elton



<P>were talked over, Emma could fairly surrender all her attention to



<P>the pleasantness of her neighbour.&nbsp; The first remote sound to which



<P>she felt herself obliged to attend, was the name of Jane Fairfax.



<P>Mrs. Cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to

be



<P>very interesting.&nbsp; She listened, and found it well worth listening

to.



<P>That very dear part of Emma, her fancy, received an amusing supply.



<P>Mrs. Cole was telling that she had been calling on Miss Bates,



<P>and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight



<P>of a pianoforte--a very elegant looking instrument--not a grand,



<P>but a large-sized square pianoforte; and the substance of the story,



<P>the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize, and inquiry,



<P>and congratulations on her side, and explanations on Miss Bates's, was,



<P>that this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood's the day before,



<P>to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece--entirely unexpected;



<P>that at first, by Miss Bates's account, Jane herself was quite at



<P>a loss, quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it--



<P>but now, they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only



<P>one quarter;--of course it must be from Colonel Campbell.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"One can suppose nothing else," added Mrs. Cole, "and I was only



<P>surprized that there could ever have been a doubt.&nbsp; But Jane,



<P>it seems, had a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said



<P>about it.&nbsp; She knows their ways best; but I should not consider

their



<P>silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present.



<P>They might chuse to surprize her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on the



<P>subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell,



<P>and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there



<P>were enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way,



<P>and still listen to Mrs. Cole.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given



<P>me more satisfaction!--It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax,



<P>who plays so delightfully, should not have an instrument.



<P>It seemed quite a shame, especially considering how many houses



<P>there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away.



<P>This is like giving ourselves a slap, to be sure! and it was



<P>but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole, I really was ashamed



<P>to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing-room, while I



<P>do not know one note from another, and our little girls, who are



<P>but just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of it;



<P>and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music, has not



<P>any thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest



<P>old spinet in the world, to amuse herself with.--I was saying this



<P>to Mr. Cole but yesterday, and he quite agreed with me; only he



<P>is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging



<P>himself in the purchase, hoping that some of our good neighbours might



<P>be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can;



<P>and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought--



<P>or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it.--We are in great



<P>hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing



<P>more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole's,



<P>turned to Frank Churchill.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why do you smile?" said she.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nay, why do you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Me!--I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell's being



<P>so rich and so liberal.--It is a handsome present."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I rather wonder that it was never made before."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument--



<P>which must now be shut up in London, untouched by any body."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That is a grand pianoforte, and he might think it too large



<P>for Mrs. Bates's house."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You may say what you chuse--but your countenance testifies



<P>that your thoughts on this subject are very much like mine."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not know.&nbsp; I rather believe you are giving me more credit

for



<P>acuteness than I deserve.&nbsp; I smile because you smile, and shall

probably



<P>suspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do not see what



<P>there is to question.&nbsp; If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who

can be?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mrs. Dixon! very true indeed.&nbsp; I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon.



<P>She must know as well as her father, how acceptable an instrument



<P>would be; and perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize,



<P>is more like a young woman's scheme than an elderly man's. It



<P>is Mrs. Dixon, I dare say.&nbsp; I told you that your suspicions would



<P>guide mine."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend Mr. Dixon



<P>in them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr. Dixon.--Very well.&nbsp; Yes, I immediately perceive that it must



<P>be the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.&nbsp; We were speaking the



<P>other day, you know, of his being so warm an admirer of her performance."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I



<P>had entertained before.--I do not mean to reflect upon the good



<P>intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help



<P>suspecting either that, after making his proposals to her friend,



<P>he had the misfortune to fall in love with her, or that he became



<P>conscious of a little attachment on her side.&nbsp; One might guess



<P>twenty things without guessing exactly the right; but I am sure



<P>there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury



<P>instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland.&nbsp; Here, she must

be



<P>leading a life of privation and penance; there it would have been



<P>all enjoyment.&nbsp; As to the pretence of trying her native air, I

look



<P>upon that as a mere excuse.--In the summer it might have passed;



<P>but what can any body's native air do for them in the months



<P>of January, February, and March?&nbsp; Good fires and carriages would



<P>be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health, and I



<P>dare say in her's. I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions,



<P>though you make so noble a profession of doing it, but I honestly



<P>tell you what they are."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability.



<P>Mr. Dixon's preference of her music to her friend's, I can answer



<P>for being very decided."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And then, he saved her life.&nbsp; Did you ever hear of that?--



<P>A water party; and by some accident she was falling overboard.



<P>He caught her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He did.&nbsp; I was there--one of the party."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Were you really?--Well!--But you observed nothing of course,



<P>for it seems to be a new idea to you.--If I had been there, I think



<P>I should have made some discoveries."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact,



<P>that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon



<P>caught her.--It was the work of a moment.&nbsp; And though the consequent



<P>shock and alarm was very great and much more durable--indeed I



<P>believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again--



<P>yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar



<P>anxiety to be observable.&nbsp; I do not mean to say, however, that

you



<P>might not have made discoveries."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The conversation was here interrupted.&nbsp; They were called on to

share



<P>in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses,



<P>and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others; but when



<P>the table was again safely covered, when every corner dish was placed



<P>exactly right, and occupation and ease were generally restored,



<P>Emma said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me.&nbsp; I wanted

to know



<P>a little more, and this tells me quite enough.&nbsp; Depend upon it,



<P>we shall soon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we



<P>must conclude it to come from the Campbells."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells.&nbsp; Miss Fairfax knows

it



<P>is not from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at first.



<P>She would not have been puzzled, had she dared fix on them.



<P>I may not have convinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced



<P>myself that Mr. Dixon is a principal in the business."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced.&nbsp; Your reasonings



<P>carry my judgment along with them entirely.&nbsp; At first, while I



<P>supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw



<P>it only as paternal kindness, and thought it the most natural thing



<P>in the world.&nbsp; But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much

more



<P>probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship.



<P>And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was no occasion to press the matter farther.&nbsp; The conviction



<P>seemed real; he looked as if he felt it.&nbsp; She said no more,



<P>other subjects took their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away;



<P>the dessert succeeded, the children came in, and were talked



<P>to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation; a few clever



<P>things said, a few downright silly, but by much the larger proportion



<P>neither the one nor the other--nothing worse than everyday remarks,



<P>dull repetitions, old news, and heavy jokes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before the other ladies,



<P>in their different divisions, arrived.&nbsp; Emma watched the entree

of her



<P>own particular little friend; and if she could not exult in her dignity



<P>and grace, she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the



<P>artless manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light, cheerful,



<P>unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations



<P>of pleasure, in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection.



<P>There she sat--and who would have guessed how many tears she had



<P>been lately shedding?&nbsp; To be in company, nicely dressed herself



<P>and seeing others nicely dressed, to sit and smile and look pretty,



<P>and say nothing, was enough for the happiness of the present hour.



<P>Jane Fairfax did look and move superior; but Emma suspected she



<P>might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet, very glad



<P>to have purchased the mortification of having loved--yes, of having



<P>loved even Mr. Elton in vain--by the surrender of all the dangerous



<P>pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her.



<P>She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she felt too much



<P>in the secret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity



<P>or interest fair, and therefore purposely kept at a distance;



<P>but by the others, the subject was almost immediately introduced,



<P>and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations



<P>were received, the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of "my



<P>excellent friend Colonel Campbell."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interested



<P>by the circumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at her



<P>perseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask



<P>and to say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious



<P>of that wish of saying as little about it as possible, which she



<P>plainly read in the fair heroine's countenance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first of

the



<P>early was Frank Churchill.&nbsp; In he walked, the first and the handsomest;



<P>and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates and



<P>her niece, made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle,



<P>where sat Miss Woodhouse; and till he could find a seat by her,



<P>would not sit at all.&nbsp; Emma divined what every body present must



<P>be thinking.&nbsp; She was his object, and every body must perceive

it.



<P>She introduced him to her friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient



<P>moments afterwards, heard what each thought of the other.&nbsp; "He

had



<P>never seen so lovely a face, and was delighted with her naivete."



<P>And she, "Only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment,



<P>but she did think there were some looks a little like Mr. Elton."



<P>Emma restrained her indignation, and only turned from her in silence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first



<P>glancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech.



<P>He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining-room--



<P>hated sitting long--was always the first to move when he could--



<P>that his father, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left



<P>very busy over parish business--that as long as he had staid,



<P>however, it had been pleasant enough, as he had found them in general



<P>a set of gentlemanlike, sensible men; and spoke so handsomely of



<P>Highbury altogether--thought it so abundant in agreeable families--



<P>that Emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place



<P>rather too much.&nbsp; She questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire--



<P>the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe, and the sort;



<P>and could make out from his answers that, as far as Enscombe



<P>was concerned, there was very little going on, that their visitings



<P>were among a range of great families, none very near; and that even



<P>when days were fixed, and invitations accepted, it was an even



<P>chance that Mrs. Churchill were not in health and spirits for going;



<P>that they made a point of visiting no fresh person; and that,



<P>though he had his separate engagements, it was not without difficulty,



<P>without considerable address at times, that he could get away,



<P>or introduce an acquaintance for a night.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury,



<P>taken at its best, might reasonably please a young man who had more



<P>retirement at home than he liked.&nbsp; His importance at Enscombe was



<P>very evident.&nbsp; He did not boast, but it naturally betrayed itself,



<P>that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing,



<P>and on her laughing and noticing it, he owned that he believed (excepting



<P>one or two points) he could with time persuade her to any thing.



<P>One of those points on which his influence failed, he then mentioned.



<P>He had wanted very much to go abroad--had been very eager indeed



<P>to be allowed to travel--but she would not hear of it.&nbsp; This had



<P>happened the year before.&nbsp; Now, he said, he was beginning to have



<P>no longer the same wish.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The unpersuadable point, which he did not mention, Emma guessed



<P>to be good behaviour to his father.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have made a most wretched discovery," said he, after a short pause.--



<P>"I have been here a week to-morrow--half my time.&nbsp; I never knew



<P>days fly so fast.&nbsp; A week to-morrow!--And I have hardly begun to



<P>enjoy myself.&nbsp; But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and others!--



<P>I hate the recollection."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day,



<P>out of so few, in having your hair cut."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No," said he, smiling, "that is no subject of regret at all.



<P>I have no pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself



<P>fit to be seen."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found herself



<P>obliged to turn from him for a few minutes, and listen to Mr. Cole.



<P>When Mr. Cole had moved away, and her attention could be restored



<P>as before, she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room



<P>at Miss Fairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What is the matter?" said she.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He started.&nbsp; "Thank you for rousing me," he replied.&nbsp; "I believe



<P>I have been very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair



<P>in so odd a way--so very odd a way--that I cannot keep my eyes



<P>from her.&nbsp; I never saw any thing so outree!--Those curls!--This

must



<P>be a fancy of her own.&nbsp; I see nobody else looking like her!--



<P>I must go and ask her whether it is an Irish fashion.&nbsp; Shall I?--



<P>Yes, I will--I declare I will--and you shall see how she takes it;--



<P>whether she colours."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss



<P>Fairfax, and talking to her; but as to its effect on the young lady,



<P>as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly



<P>in front of Miss Fairfax, she could absolutely distinguish nothing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Before he could return to his chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This is the luxury of a large party," said she:--"one can get



<P>near every body, and say every thing.&nbsp; My dear Emma, I am longing



<P>to talk to you.&nbsp; I have been making discoveries and forming plans,



<P>just like yourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh.



<P>Do you know how Miss Bates and her niece came here?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How?--They were invited, were not they?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! yes--but how they were conveyed hither?--the manner of their coming?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They walked, I conclude.&nbsp; How else could they come?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very true.--Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad



<P>it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at night,



<P>and cold as the nights are now.&nbsp; And as I looked at her, though

I



<P>never saw her appear to more advantage, it struck me that she



<P>was heated, and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold.



<P>Poor girl!&nbsp; I could not bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr.

Weston



<P>came into the room, and I could get at him, I spoke to him about



<P>the carriage.&nbsp; You may guess how readily he came into my wishes;



<P>and having his approbation, I made my way directly to Miss Bates,



<P>to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took



<P>us home; for I thought it would be making her comfortable at once.



<P>Good soul! she was as grateful as possible, you may be sure.



<P>`Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!'--but with many,



<P>many thanks--`there was no occasion to trouble us, for Mr. Knightley's



<P>carriage had brought, and was to take them home again.'&nbsp; I was



<P>quite surprized;--very glad, I am sure; but really quite surprized.



<P>Such a very kind attention--and so thoughtful an attention!--



<P>the sort of thing that so few men would think of.&nbsp; And, in short,



<P>from knowing his usual ways, I am very much inclined to think



<P>that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all.



<P>I do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself,



<P>and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very likely," said Emma--"nothing more likely.&nbsp; I know no man



<P>more likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing--to do any



<P>thing really good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent.



<P>He is not a gallant man, but he is a very humane one; and this,



<P>considering Jane Fairfax's ill-health, would appear a case



<P>of humanity to him;--and for an act of unostentatious kindness,



<P>there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr. Knightley.



<P>I know he had horses to-day--for we arrived together; and I laughed

at



<P>him about it, but he said not a word that could betray."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well," said Mrs. Weston, smiling, "you give him credit for



<P>more simple, disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do;



<P>for while Miss Bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head,



<P>and I have never been able to get it out again.&nbsp; The more I think



<P>of it, the more probable it appears.&nbsp; In short, I have made a match



<P>between Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax.&nbsp; See the consequence



<P>of keeping you company!--What do you say to it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!" exclaimed Emma.&nbsp; "Dear Mrs. Weston,



<P>how could you think of such a thing?--Mr. Knightley!--Mr. Knightley



<P>must not marry!--You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?--



<P>Oh! no, no, Henry must have Donwell.&nbsp; I cannot at all consent to



<P>Mr. Knightley's marrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely.



<P>I am amazed that you should think of such a thing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it.



<P>I do not want the match--I do not want to injure dear little Henry--



<P>but the idea has been given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley



<P>really wished to marry, you would not have him refrain on Henry's



<P>account, a boy of six years old, who knows nothing of the matter?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, I would.&nbsp; I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.--



<P>Mr. Knightley marry!--No, I have never had such an idea, and I



<P>cannot adopt it now.&nbsp; And Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nay, she has always been a first favourite with him, as you



<P>very well know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But the imprudence of such a match!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation



<P>than what you mention.&nbsp; His good-nature, his humanity, as I tell

you,



<P>would be quite enough to account for the horses.&nbsp; He has a great



<P>regard for the Bateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax--



<P>and is always glad to shew them attention.&nbsp; My dear Mrs. Weston,



<P>do not take to match-making.&nbsp; You do it very ill.&nbsp; Jane Fairfax

mistress



<P>of the Abbey!--Oh! no, no;--every feeling revolts.&nbsp; For his own

sake,



<P>I would not have him do so mad a thing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Imprudent, if you please--but not mad.&nbsp; Excepting inequality of

fortune,



<P>and perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing unsuitable."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry.&nbsp; I am sure he has not

the



<P>least idea of it.&nbsp; Do not put it into his head.&nbsp; Why should

he marry?--



<P>He is as happy as possible by himself; with his farm, and his sheep,



<P>and his library, and all the parish to manage; and he is extremely



<P>fond of his brother's children.&nbsp; He has no occasion to marry,



<P>either to fill up his time or his heart."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Emma, as long as he thinks so, it is so; but if he really



<P>loves Jane Fairfax--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nonsense!&nbsp; He does not care about Jane Fairfax.&nbsp; In the way



<P>of love, I am sure he does not.&nbsp; He would do any good to her,



<P>or her family; but--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well," said Mrs. Weston, laughing, "perhaps the greatest good he



<P>could do them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If it would be good to her, I am sure it would be evil to himself;



<P>a very shameful and degrading connexion.&nbsp; How would he bear to

have



<P>Miss Bates belonging to him?--To have her haunting the Abbey,



<P>and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?--



<P>`So very kind and obliging!--But he always had been such a very



<P>kind neighbour!'&nbsp; And then fly off, through half a sentence,



<P>to her mother's old petticoat.&nbsp; `Not that it was such a very old



<P>petticoat either--for still it would last a great while--and, indeed,



<P>she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong.'"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"For shame, Emma!&nbsp; Do not mimic her.&nbsp; You divert me against



<P>my conscience.&nbsp; And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley

would



<P>be much disturbed by Miss Bates.&nbsp; Little things do not irritate

him.



<P>She might talk on; and if he wanted to say any thing himself, he would



<P>only talk louder, and drown her voice.&nbsp; But the question is not,



<P>whether it would be a bad connexion for him, but whether he wishes it;



<P>and I think he does.&nbsp; I have heard him speak, and so must you,



<P>so very highly of Jane Fairfax!&nbsp; The interest he takes in her--



<P>his anxiety about her health--his concern that she should have no



<P>happier prospect!&nbsp; I have heard him express himself so warmly on



<P>those points!--Such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte,



<P>and of her voice!&nbsp; I have heard him say that he could listen to

her



<P>for ever.&nbsp; Oh! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred



<P>to me--this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody--



<P>though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present



<P>from the Campbells, may it not be from Mr. Knightley?&nbsp; I cannot



<P>help suspecting him.&nbsp; I think he is just the person to do it,



<P>even without being in love."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love.



<P>But I do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do.



<P>Mr. Knightley does nothing mysteriously."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly;



<P>oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common



<P>course of things, occur to him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would have



<P>told her so."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma.&nbsp; I have a very



<P>strong notion that it comes from him.&nbsp; I am sure he was particularly



<P>silent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you have



<P>many a time reproached me with doing.&nbsp; I see no sign of attachment--



<P>I believe nothing of the pianoforte--and proof only shall convince



<P>me that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rather



<P>gaining ground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs. Weston was



<P>the most used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room



<P>shewed them that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;--



<P>and at the same moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse



<P>would do them the honour of trying it.&nbsp; Frank Churchill, of whom,



<P>in the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs. Weston, she had been



<P>seeing nothing, except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax,



<P>followed Mr. Cole, to add his very pressing entreaties; and as,



<P>in every respect, it suited Emma best to lead, she gave a very



<P>proper compliance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt



<P>more than she could perform with credit; she wanted neither taste



<P>nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable,



<P>and could accompany her own voice well.&nbsp; One accompaniment to her

song



<P>took her agreeably by surprize--a second, slightly but correctly



<P>taken by Frank Churchill.&nbsp; Her pardon was duly begged at the close



<P>of the song, and every thing usual followed.&nbsp; He was accused



<P>of having a delightful voice, and a perfect knowledge of music;



<P>which was properly denied; and that he knew nothing of the matter,



<P>and had no voice at all, roundly asserted.&nbsp; They sang together



<P>once more; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss Fairfax,



<P>whose performance, both vocal and instrumental, she never could



<P>attempt to conceal from herself, was infinitely superior to her own.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With mixed feelings, she seated herself at a little distance from the



<P>numbers round the instrument, to listen.&nbsp; Frank Churchill sang

again.



<P>They had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth.



<P>But the sight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew



<P>away half Emma's mind; and she fell into a train of thinking



<P>on the subject of Mrs. Weston's suspicions, to which the sweet



<P>sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions.



<P>Her objections to Mr. Knightley's marrying did not in the least subside.



<P>She could see nothing but evil in it.&nbsp; It would be a great



<P>disappointment to Mr. John Knightley; consequently to Isabella.



<P>A real injury to the children--a most mortifying change,



<P>and material loss to them all;--a very great deduction from her



<P>father's daily comfort--and, as to herself, she could not at all



<P>endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey.&nbsp; A Mrs. Knightley



<P>for them all to give way to!--No--Mr. Knightley must never marry.



<P>Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Presently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her.



<P>They talked at first only of the performance.&nbsp; His admiration



<P>was certainly very warm; yet she thought, but for Mrs. Weston,



<P>it would not have struck her.&nbsp; As a sort of touchstone, however,



<P>she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece;



<P>and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short,



<P>she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any



<P>kindness of his own.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I often feel concern," said she, "that I dare not make our carriage



<P>more useful on such occasions.&nbsp; It is not that I am without the

wish;



<P>but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James



<P>should put-to for such a purpose."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Quite out of the question, quite out of the question," he replied;--



<P>"but you must often wish it, I am sure."&nbsp; And he smiled with such



<P>seeming pleasure at the conviction, that she must proceed another step.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This present from the Campbells," said she--"this pianoforte



<P>is very kindly given."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," he replied, and without the smallest apparent embarrassment.--



<P>"But they would have done better had they given her notice of it.



<P>Surprizes are foolish things.&nbsp; The pleasure is not enhanced, and

the



<P>inconvenience is often considerable.&nbsp; I should have expected better



<P>judgment in Colonel Campbell."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>From that moment, Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley



<P>had had no concern in giving the instrument.&nbsp; But whether he



<P>were entirely free from peculiar attachment--whether there



<P>were no actual preference--remained a little longer doubtful.



<P>Towards the end of Jane's second song, her voice grew thick.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That will do," said he, when it was finished, thinking aloud--



<P>"you have sung quite enough for one evening--now be quiet."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Another song, however, was soon begged for.&nbsp; "One more;--they would



<P>not fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for



<P>one more."&nbsp; And Frank Churchill was heard to say, "I think you

could



<P>manage this without effort; the first part is so very trifling.



<P>The strength of the song falls on the second."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Knightley grew angry.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That fellow," said he, indignantly, "thinks of nothing but shewing



<P>off his own voice.&nbsp; This must not be."&nbsp; And touching Miss

Bates,



<P>who at that moment passed near--"Miss Bates, are you mad, to let



<P>your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner?&nbsp; Go, and interfere.



<P>They have no mercy on her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Bates, in her real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even



<P>to be grateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all



<P>farther singing.&nbsp; Here ceased the concert part of the evening,



<P>for Miss Woodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers;



<P>but soon (within five minutes) the proposal of dancing--



<P>originating nobody exactly knew where--was so effectually promoted



<P>by Mr. and Mrs. Cole, that every thing was rapidly clearing away,



<P>to give proper space.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston, capital in her country-dances,



<P>was seated, and beginning an irresistible waltz; and Frank Churchill,



<P>coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma, had secured her hand,



<P>and led her up to the top.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off,



<P>Emma found time, in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her



<P>voice and her taste, to look about, and see what became of Mr. Knightley.



<P>This would be a trial.&nbsp; He was no dancer in general.&nbsp; If he

were to be



<P>very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augur something.



<P>There was no immediate appearance.&nbsp; No; he was talking to Mrs.

Cole--



<P>he was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody else,



<P>and he was still talking to Mrs. Cole.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his interest was yet safe;



<P>and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment.



<P>Not more than five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the



<P>suddenness of it made it very delightful, and she found herself well



<P>matched in a partner.&nbsp; They were a couple worth looking at.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Two dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed.



<P>It was growing late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home,



<P>on her mother's account.&nbsp; After some attempts, therefore, to be



<P>permitted to begin again, they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston,



<P>look sorrowful, and have done.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Perhaps it is as well," said Frank Churchill, as he attended Emma



<P>to her carriage.&nbsp; "I must have asked Miss Fairfax, and her languid



<P>dancing would not have agreed with me, after your's."

<B>CHAPTER IX</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Emma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles.



<P>The visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day;



<P>and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side



<P>of dignified seclusion, must be amply repaid in the splendour



<P>of popularity.&nbsp; She must have delighted the Coles--worthy people,



<P>who deserved to be made happy!--And left a name behind her that would



<P>not soon die away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Perfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were



<P>two points on which she was not quite easy.&nbsp; She doubted whether



<P>she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying



<P>her suspicions of Jane Fairfax's feelings to Frank Churchill.



<P>It was hardly right; but it had been so strong an idea, that it



<P>would escape her, and his submission to all that she told,



<P>was a compliment to her penetration, which made it difficult



<P>for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax;



<P>and there she had no doubt.&nbsp; She did unfeignedly and unequivocally



<P>regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing.&nbsp; She did



<P>most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood--and sat



<P>down and practised vigorously an hour and a half.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was then interrupted by Harriet's coming in; and if Harriet's



<P>praise could have satisfied her, she might soon have been comforted.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't class us together, Harriet.&nbsp; My playing is no more like



<P>her's, than a lamp is like sunshine."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! dear--I think you play the best of the two.&nbsp; I think you play



<P>quite as well as she does.&nbsp; I am sure I had much rather hear you.



<P>Every body last night said how well you played."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference.



<P>The truth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised,



<P>but Jane Fairfax's is much beyond it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does,



<P>or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out.



<P>Mr. Cole said how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked



<P>a great deal about your taste, and that he valued taste much more



<P>than execution."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Are you sure?&nbsp; I saw she had execution, but I did not know she

had



<P>any taste.&nbsp; Nobody talked about it.&nbsp; And I hate Italian singing.--



<P>There is no understanding a word of it.&nbsp; Besides, if she does play



<P>so very well, you know, it is no more than she is obliged to do,



<P>because she will have to teach.&nbsp; The Coxes were wondering last

night



<P>whether she would get into any great family.&nbsp; How did you think

the



<P>Coxes looked?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Just as they always do--very vulgar."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They told me something," said Harriet rather hesitatingly;"



<P>but it is nothing of any consequence."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her, though fearful



<P>of its producing Mr. Elton.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They told me---that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He came to their father upon some business, and he asked him



<P>to stay to dinner."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They talked a great deal about him, especially Anne Cox.



<P>I do not know what she meant, but she asked me if I thought I



<P>should go and stay there again next summer."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne Cox



<P>should be."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there.&nbsp; He sat



<P>by her at dinner.&nbsp; Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would



<P>be very glad to marry him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very likely.--I think they are, without exception, the most vulgar



<P>girls in Highbury."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet had business at Ford's.--Emma thought it most prudent to go



<P>with her.&nbsp; Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible,



<P>and in her present state, would be dangerous.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, was always



<P>very long at a purchase; and while she was still hanging over muslins



<P>and changing her mind, Emma went to the door for amusement.--Much could



<P>not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;--



<P>Mr. Perry walking hastily by, Mr. William Cox letting himself in at



<P>the office-door, Mr. Cole's carriage-horses returning from exercise,



<P>or a stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule, were the liveliest



<P>objects she could presume to expect; and when her eyes fell only on



<P>the butcher with his tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from



<P>shop with her full basket, two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone,



<P>and a string of dawdling children round the baker's little bow-window



<P>eyeing the gingerbread, she knew she had no reason to complain,



<P>and was amused enough; quite enough still to stand at the door.



<P>A mind lively and at ease, can do with seeing nothing, and can see



<P>nothing that does not answer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She looked down the Randalls road.&nbsp; The scene enlarged;



<P>two persons appeared; Mrs. Weston and her son-in-law; they were



<P>walking into Highbury;--to Hartfield of course.&nbsp; They were stopping,



<P>however, in the first place at Mrs. Bates's; whose house was



<P>a little nearer Randalls than Ford's; and had all but knocked,



<P>when Emma caught their eye.--Immediately they crossed the road



<P>and came forward to her; and the agreeableness of yesterday's



<P>engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting.



<P>Mrs. Weston informed her that she was going to call on the Bateses,



<P>in order to hear the new instrument.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"For my companion tells me," said she, "that I absolutely promised



<P>Miss Bates last night, that I would come this morning.&nbsp; I was



<P>not aware of it myself.&nbsp; I did not know that I had fixed a day,



<P>but as he says I did, I am going now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit, I may be allowed, I hope,"



<P>said Frank Churchill, "to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield--



<P>if you are going home."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Weston was disappointed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I thought you meant to go with me.&nbsp; They would be very much pleased."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Me!&nbsp; I should be quite in the way.&nbsp; But, perhaps--I may be

equally



<P>in the way here.&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me.



<P>My aunt always sends me off when she is shopping.&nbsp; She says I fidget



<P>her to death; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say



<P>the same.&nbsp; What am I to do?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am here on no business of my own," said Emma; "I am only waiting



<P>for my friend.&nbsp; She will probably have soon done, and then we



<P>shall go home.&nbsp; But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear



<P>the instrument."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well--if you advise it.--But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbell



<P>should have employed a careless friend, and if it should prove



<P>to have an indifferent tone--what shall I say?&nbsp; I shall be no



<P>support to Mrs. Weston.&nbsp; She might do very well by herself.



<P>A disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips, but I



<P>am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not believe any such thing," replied Emma.--"I am persuaded



<P>that you can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary;



<P>but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent.



<P>Quite otherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax's opinion



<P>last night."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do come with me," said Mrs. Weston, "if it be not very disagreeable



<P>to you.&nbsp; It need not detain us long.&nbsp; We will go to Hartfield

afterwards.



<P>We will follow them to Hartfield.&nbsp; I really wish you to call with

me.



<P>It will be felt so great an attention! and I always thought you



<P>meant it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him,



<P>returned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates's door.&nbsp; Emma watched them

in,



<P>and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,--trying, with all



<P>the force of her own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plain



<P>muslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon,



<P>be it ever so beautiful, would still never match her yellow pattern.



<P>At last it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard's, ma'am?" asked Mrs. Ford.--



<P>"Yes--no--yes, to Mrs. Goddard's. Only my pattern gown is



<P>at Hartfield.&nbsp; No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please.



<P>But then, Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.--And I could take the



<P>pattern gown home any day.&nbsp; But I shall want the ribbon directly--



<P>so it had better go to Hartfield--at least the ribbon.&nbsp; You could



<P>make it into two parcels, Mrs. Ford, could not you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble



<P>of two parcels."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No more it is."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No trouble in the world, ma'am," said the obliging Mrs. Ford.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one.



<P>Then, if you please, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard's--



<P>I do not know--No, I think, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well



<P>have it sent to Hartfield, and take it home with me at night.



<P>What do you advise?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That you do not give another half-second to the subject.



<P>To Hartfield, if you please, Mrs. Ford."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Aye, that will be much best," said Harriet, quite satisfied,



<P>"I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard's."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Voices approached the shop--or rather one voice and two ladies:



<P>Mrs. Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Miss Woodhouse," said the latter, "I am just run across to



<P>entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while,



<P>and give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith.



<P>How do you do, Miss Smith?--Very well I thank you.--And I begged



<P>Mrs. Weston to come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very well, I am much obliged to you.&nbsp; My mother is delightfully

well;



<P>and Jane caught no cold last night.&nbsp; How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am

so glad



<P>to hear such a good account.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston told me you were here.--



<P>Oh! then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will



<P>allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother



<P>will be so very happy to see her--and now we are such a nice party,



<P>she cannot refuse.--`Aye, pray do,' said Mr. Frank Churchill,



<P>`Miss Woodhouse's opinion of the instrument will be worth having.'--



<P>But, said I, I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go



<P>with me.--`Oh,' said he, `wait half a minute, till I have finished



<P>my job;'--For, would you believe it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is,



<P>in the most obliging manner in the world, fastening in the rivet of

my



<P>mother's spectacles.--The rivet came out, you know, this morning.--



<P>So very obliging!--For my mother had no use of her spectacles--



<P>could not put them on.&nbsp; And, by the bye, every body ought to have



<P>two pair of spectacles; they should indeed.&nbsp; Jane said so.



<P>I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did,



<P>but something or other hindered me all the morning; first one thing,



<P>then another, there is no saying what, you know.&nbsp; At one time Patty

came



<P>to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping.&nbsp; Oh, said

I,



<P>Patty do not come with your bad news to me.&nbsp; Here is the rivet



<P>of your mistress's spectacles out.&nbsp; Then the baked apples came

home,



<P>Mrs. Wallis sent them by her boy; they are extremely civil and



<P>obliging to us, the Wallises, always--I have heard some people



<P>say that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer,



<P>but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention



<P>from them.&nbsp; And it cannot be for the value of our custom now,



<P>for what is our consumption of bread, you know?&nbsp; Only three of

us.--



<P>besides dear Jane at present--and she really eats nothing--makes such



<P>a shocking breakfast, you would be quite frightened if you saw it.



<P>I dare not let my mother know how little she eats--so I say one



<P>thing and then I say another, and it passes off.&nbsp; But about the



<P>middle of the day she gets hungry, and there is nothing she likes



<P>so well as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome,



<P>for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry;



<P>I happened to meet him in the street.&nbsp; Not that I had any doubt

before--



<P>I have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple.



<P>I believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the



<P>fruit thoroughly wholesome.&nbsp; We have apple-dumplings, however,



<P>very often.&nbsp; Patty makes an excellent apple-dumpling. Well,



<P>Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I hope, and these ladies will



<P>oblige us."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma would be "very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &amp;c.," and they



<P>did at last move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss



<P>Bates than,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How do you do, Mrs. Ford?&nbsp; I beg your pardon.&nbsp; I did not

see



<P>you before.&nbsp; I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons



<P>from town.&nbsp; Jane came back delighted yesterday.&nbsp; Thank ye,



<P>the gloves do very well--only a little too large about the wrist;



<P>but Jane is taking them in."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What was I talking of?" said she, beginning again when they were



<P>all in the street.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma wondered on what, of all the medley, she would fix.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.--Oh! my



<P>mother's spectacles.&nbsp; So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill!



<P>`Oh!' said he, `I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job



<P>of this kind excessively.'--Which you know shewed him to be so



<P>very. . . . Indeed I must say that, much as I had heard of him



<P>before and much as I had expected, he very far exceeds any



<P>thing. . . . I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston, most warmly.



<P>He seems every thing the fondest parent could. . . . `Oh!' said he,



<P>`I can fasten the rivet.&nbsp; I like a job of that sort excessively.'



<P>I never shall forget his manner.&nbsp; And when I brought out the baked



<P>apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so very



<P>obliging as to take some, `Oh!' said he directly, `there is nothing



<P>in the way of fruit half so good, and these are the finest-looking



<P>home-baked apples I ever saw in my life.'&nbsp; That, you know, was

so



<P>very. . . . And I am sure, by his manner, it was no compliment.



<P>Indeed they are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis does them



<P>full justice--only we do not have them baked more than twice,



<P>and Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times--



<P>but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it.&nbsp; The apples



<P>themselves are the very finest sort for baking, beyond a doubt;



<P>all from Donwell--some of Mr. Knightley's most liberal supply.



<P>He sends us a sack every year; and certainly there never was such



<P>a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees--I believe there



<P>is two of them.&nbsp; My mother says the orchard was always famous



<P>in her younger days.&nbsp; But I was really quite shocked the other

day--



<P>for Mr. Knightley called one morning, and Jane was eating these apples,



<P>and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them,



<P>and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock.



<P>`I am sure you must be,' said he, `and I will send you



<P>another supply; for I have a great many more than I can ever use.



<P>William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year.



<P>I will send you some more, before they get good for nothing.'



<P>So I begged he would not--for really as to ours being gone, I could



<P>not absolutely say that we had a great many left--it was but half



<P>a dozen indeed; but they should be all kept for Jane; and I could



<P>not at all bear that he should be sending us more, so liberal as he



<P>had been already; and Jane said the same.&nbsp; And when he was gone,



<P>she almost quarrelled with me--No, I should not say quarrelled,



<P>for we never had a quarrel in our lives; but she was quite distressed



<P>that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone; she wished I had



<P>made him believe we had a great many left.&nbsp; Oh, said I, my dear,



<P>I did say as much as I could.&nbsp; However, the very same evening



<P>William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples, the same



<P>sort of apples, a bushel at least, and I was very much obliged,



<P>and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing,



<P>as you may suppose.&nbsp; William Larkins is such an old acquaintance!



<P>I am always glad to see him.&nbsp; But, however, I found afterwards



<P>from Patty, that William said it was all the apples of that sort



<P>his master had; he had brought them all--and now his master had not



<P>one left to bake or boil.&nbsp; William did not seem to mind it himself,



<P>he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many; for William,



<P>you know, thinks more of his master's profit than any thing;



<P>but Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their being



<P>all sent away.&nbsp; She could not bear that her master should not be



<P>able to have another apple-tart this spring.&nbsp; He told Patty this,



<P>but bid her not mind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us



<P>about it, for Mrs. Hodges would be cross sometimes, and as long as



<P>so many sacks were sold, it did not signify who ate the remainder.



<P>And so Patty told me, and I was excessively shocked indeed!



<P>I would not have Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for



<P>the world!&nbsp; He would be so very. . . . I wanted to keep it from



<P>Jane's knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it before I was



<P>aware."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitors



<P>walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to,



<P>pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning.



<P>Pray take care, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase--



<P>rather darker and narrower than one could wish.&nbsp; Miss Smith,



<P>pray take care.&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse, I am quite concerned, I am sure

you



<P>hit your foot.&nbsp; Miss Smith, the step at the turning."

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>"I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you,"



<P>said Mr. Weston.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended



<P>her by such a hope, smiled most graciously.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume," he continued--



<P>"and know him to be my son, though he does not bear my name."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance.



<P>I am sure Mr. Elton will lose no time in calling on him; and we



<P>shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are very obliging.--Frank will be extremely happy, I am sure.--



<P>He is to be in town next week, if not sooner.&nbsp; We have notice of

it



<P>in a letter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning,



<P>and seeing my son's hand, presumed to open it--though it was not directed



<P>to me--it was to Mrs. Weston.&nbsp; She is his principal correspondent,



<P>I assure you.&nbsp; I hardly ever get a letter."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her!&nbsp; Oh!&nbsp;

Mr. Weston--



<P>(laughing affectedly) I must protest against that.--A most dangerous



<P>precedent indeed!--I beg you will not let your neighbours follow



<P>your example.--Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect,



<P>we married women must begin to exert ourselves!--Oh!&nbsp; Mr. Weston,



<P>I could not have believed it of you!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Aye, we men are sad fellows.&nbsp; You must take care of yourself,



<P>Mrs. Elton.--This letter tells us--it is a short letter--written in



<P>a hurry, merely to give us notice--it tells us that they are all



<P>coming up to town directly, on Mrs. Churchill's account--she has



<P>not been well the whole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for her--



<P>so they are all to move southward without loss of time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed!--from Yorkshire, I think.&nbsp; Enscombe is in Yorkshire?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London.



<P>a considerable journey."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, upon my word, very considerable.&nbsp; Sixty-five miles farther



<P>than from Maple Grove to London.&nbsp; But what is distance, Mr. Weston,



<P>to people of large fortune?--You would be amazed to hear how my brother,



<P>Mr. Suckling, sometimes flies about.&nbsp; You will hardly believe me--



<P>but twice in one week he and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again



<P>with four horses."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The evil of the distance from Enscombe," said Mr. Weston, "is, that



<P>Mrs. Churchill, as we understand, has not been able to leave the



<P>sofa for a week together.&nbsp; In Frank's last letter she complained,



<P>he said, of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having



<P>both his arm and his uncle's! This, you know, speaks a great degree



<P>of weakness--but now she is so impatient to be in town, that she



<P>means to sleep only two nights on the road.--So Frank writes word.



<P>Certainly, delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions,



<P>Mrs. Elton.&nbsp; You must grant me that."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing.&nbsp; I Always take the part



<P>of my own sex.&nbsp; I do indeed.&nbsp; I give you notice--You will

find me



<P>a formidable antagonist on that point.&nbsp; I always stand up for women--



<P>and I assure you, if you knew how Selina feels with respect



<P>to sleeping at an inn, you would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill's



<P>making incredible exertions to avoid it.&nbsp; Selina says it is quite



<P>horror to her--and I believe I have caught a little of her nicety.



<P>She always travels with her own sheets; an excellent precaution.



<P>Does Mrs. Churchill do the same?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Depend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other



<P>fine lady ever did.&nbsp; Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady



<P>in the land for"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Elton eagerly interposed with,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh!&nbsp; Mr. Weston, do not mistake me.&nbsp; Selina is no fine lady,



<P>I assure you.&nbsp; Do not run away with such an idea."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Is not she?&nbsp; Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is



<P>as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly.



<P>It was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister



<P>was not a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence



<P>of it;--and she was considering in what way she had best retract,



<P>when Mr. Weston went on.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect--



<P>but this is quite between ourselves.&nbsp; She is very fond of Frank,



<P>and therefore I would not speak ill of her.&nbsp; Besides, she is out

of



<P>health now; but that indeed, by her own account, she has always been.



<P>I would not say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much



<P>faith in Mrs. Churchill's illness."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?--To Bath,



<P>or to Clifton?"&nbsp; "She has taken it into her head that Enscombe

is too



<P>cold for her.&nbsp; The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe.



<P>She has now been a longer time stationary there, than she ever



<P>was before, and she begins to want change.&nbsp; It is a retired place.



<P>A fine place, but very retired."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Aye--like Maple Grove, I dare say.&nbsp; Nothing can stand more retired

from



<P>the road than Maple Grove.&nbsp; Such an immense plantation all round

it!



<P>You seem shut out from every thing--in the most complete retirement.--



<P>And Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina



<P>to enjoy that sort of seclusion.&nbsp; Or, perhaps she may not have



<P>resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life.



<P>I always say a woman cannot have too many resources--and I feel



<P>very thankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent



<P>of society."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Frank was here in February for a fortnight."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So I remember to have heard.&nbsp; He will find an addition to the



<P>society of Highbury when he comes again; that is, if I may presume



<P>to call myself an addition.&nbsp; But perhaps he may never have heard



<P>of there being such a creature in the world."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by,



<P>and Mr. Weston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear madam!&nbsp; Nobody but yourself could imagine such a



<P>thing possible.&nbsp; Not heard of you!--I believe Mrs. Weston's



<P>letters lately have been full of very little else than Mrs. Elton."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had done his duty and could return to his son.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"When Frank left us," continued he, "it was quite uncertain when we



<P>might see him again, which makes this day's news doubly welcome.



<P>It has been completely unexpected.&nbsp; That is, I always had a strong



<P>persuasion he would be here again soon, I was sure something



<P>favourable would turn up--but nobody believed me.&nbsp; He and Mrs.

Weston



<P>were both dreadfully desponding.&nbsp; `How could he contrive to come?



<P>And how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare



<P>him again?' and so forth--I always felt that something would happen



<P>in our favour; and so it has, you see.&nbsp; I have observed, Mrs. Elton,



<P>in the course of my life, that if things are going untowardly one month,



<P>they are sure to mend the next."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true.&nbsp; It is just what I used



<P>to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship,



<P>when, because things did not go quite right, did not proceed with all



<P>the rapidity which suited his feelings, he was apt to be in despair,



<P>and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be May before



<P>Hymen's saffron robe would be put on for us.&nbsp; Oh! the pains I have



<P>been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views!



<P>The carriage--we had disappointments about the carriage;--one morning,



<P>I remember, he came to me quite in despair."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly



<P>seized the opportunity of going on.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You were mentioning May.&nbsp; May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill



<P>is ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place



<P>than Enscombe--in short, to spend in London; so that we have the



<P>agreeable prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring--



<P>precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen



<P>for it:&nbsp; days almost at the longest; weather genial and pleasant,



<P>always inviting one out, and never too hot for exercise.&nbsp; When

he



<P>was here before, we made the best of it; but there was a good deal



<P>of wet, damp, cheerless weather; there always is in February, you know,



<P>and we could not do half that we intended.&nbsp; Now will be the time.



<P>This will be complete enjoyment; and I do not know, Mrs. Elton,



<P>whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the sort of constant



<P>expectation there will be of his coming in to-day or to-morrow,



<P>and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness than having



<P>him actually in the house.&nbsp; I think it is so.&nbsp; I think it

is the



<P>state of mind which gives most spirit and delight.&nbsp; I hope you



<P>will be pleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy.



<P>He is generally thought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy.



<P>Mrs. Weston's partiality for him is very great, and, as you may suppose,



<P>most gratifying to me.&nbsp; She thinks nobody equal to him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my



<P>opinion will be decidedly in his favour.&nbsp; I have heard so much



<P>in praise of Mr. Frank Churchill.--At the same time it is fair



<P>to observe, that I am one of those who always judge for themselves,



<P>and are by no means implicitly guided by others.&nbsp; I give you notice



<P>that as I find your son, so I shall judge of him.--I am no flatterer."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Weston was musing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hope," said he presently, "I have not been severe upon poor



<P>Mrs. Churchill.&nbsp; If she is ill I should be sorry to do her injustice;



<P>but there are some traits in her character which make it difficult



<P>for me to speak of her with the forbearance I could wish.



<P>You cannot be ignorant, Mrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family,



<P>nor of the treatment I have met with; and, between ourselves,



<P>the whole blame of it is to be laid to her.&nbsp; She was the instigator.



<P>Frank's mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her.



<P>Mr. Churchill has pride; but his pride is nothing to his wife's:



<P>his is a quiet, indolent, gentlemanlike sort of pride that would



<P>harm nobody, and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome;



<P>but her pride is arrogance and insolence!&nbsp; And what inclines one

less



<P>to bear, she has no fair pretence of family or blood.&nbsp; She was

nobody



<P>when he married her, barely the daughter of a gentleman; but ever



<P>since her being turned into a Churchill she has out-Churchill'd them



<P>all in high and mighty claims:&nbsp; but in herself, I assure you, she

is



<P>an upstart."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking!&nbsp; I have quite



<P>a horror of upstarts.&nbsp; Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust



<P>to people of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood



<P>who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs



<P>they give themselves!&nbsp; Your description of Mrs. Churchill made

me



<P>think of them directly.&nbsp; People of the name of Tupman, very lately



<P>settled there, and encumbered with many low connexions, but giving



<P>themselves immense airs, and expecting to be on a footing with the old



<P>established families.&nbsp; A year and a half is the very utmost that

they can



<P>have lived at West Hall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows.



<P>They came from Birmingham, which is not a place to promise much,



<P>you know, Mr. Weston.&nbsp; One has not great hopes from Birmingham.



<P>I always say there is something direful in the sound:&nbsp; but nothing



<P>more is positively known of the Tupmans, though a good many things



<P>I assure you are suspected; and yet by their manners they evidently



<P>think themselves equal even to my brother, Mr. Suckling, who happens



<P>to be one of their nearest neighbours.&nbsp; It is infinitely too bad.



<P>Mr. Suckling, who has been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove,



<P>and whose father had it before him--I believe, at least--I am



<P>almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed the purchase before



<P>his death."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They were interrupted.&nbsp; Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston,



<P>having said all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of



<P>walking away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr. Woodhouse



<P>to cards.&nbsp; The remaining five were left to their own powers,



<P>and Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemed



<P>little disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice,



<P>which nobody had inclination to pay, and she was herself



<P>in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother.



<P>He was to leave them early the next day; and he soon began with--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about



<P>the boys; but you have your sister's letter, and every thing is



<P>down at full length there we may be sure.&nbsp; My charge would be much



<P>more concise than her's, and probably not much in the same spirit;



<P>all that I have to recommend being comprised in, do not spoil them,



<P>and do not physic them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I rather hope to satisfy you both," said Emma, "for I shall do all



<P>in my power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella;



<P>and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That is very likely.&nbsp; You think so, do not you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father--



<P>or even may be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagements



<P>continue to increase as much as they have done lately."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Increase!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made



<P>a great difference in your way of life."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Difference!&nbsp; No indeed I am not."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company



<P>than you used to be.&nbsp; Witness this very time.&nbsp; Here am I come



<P>down for only one day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!--



<P>When did it happen before, or any thing like it?&nbsp; Your neighbourhood



<P>is increasing, and you mix more with it.&nbsp; A little while ago,



<P>every letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties;



<P>dinners at Mr. Cole's, or balls at the Crown.&nbsp; The difference



<P>which Randalls, Randalls alone makes in your goings-on, is very great."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," said his brother quickly, "it is Randalls that does it all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very well--and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have less



<P>influence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, Emma,



<P>that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way.&nbsp; And if they are,



<P>I only beg you to send them home."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No," cried Mr. Knightley, "that need not be the consequence.



<P>Let them be sent to Donwell.&nbsp; I shall certainly be at leisure."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Upon my word," exclaimed Emma, "you amuse me!&nbsp; I should like to

know



<P>how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being



<P>of the party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure



<P>to attend to the little boys.&nbsp; These amazing engagements of mine--



<P>what have they been?&nbsp; Dining once with the Coles--and having a

ball



<P>talked of, which never took place.&nbsp; I can understand you--(nodding

at



<P>Mr. John Knightley)--your good fortune in meeting with so many of



<P>your friends at once here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed.



<P>But you, (turning to Mr. Knightley,) who know how very, very seldom



<P>I am ever two hours from Hartfield, why you should foresee such a



<P>series of dissipation for me, I cannot imagine.&nbsp; And as to my dear



<P>little boys, I must say, that if Aunt Emma has not time for them,



<P>I do not think they would fare much better with Uncle Knightley,



<P>who is absent from home about five hours where she is absent one--



<P>and who, when he is at home, is either reading to himself or settling



<P>his accounts."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded



<P>without difficulty, upon Mrs. Elton's beginning to talk to him.

<B>CHAPTER XVI</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>The hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think



<P>and be miserable.--It was a wretched business indeed!--Such an overthrow



<P>of every thing she had been wishing for!--Such a development of every



<P>thing most unwelcome!--Such a blow for Harriet!--that was the worst



<P>of all.&nbsp; Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some

sort



<P>or other; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light;



<P>and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken--



<P>more in error--more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she actually was,



<P>could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could have



<P>borne any thing.&nbsp; He might have doubled his presumption to me--



<P>but poor Harriet!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>How she could have been so deceived!--He protested that he



<P>had never thought seriously of Harriet--never!&nbsp; She looked back



<P>as well as she could; but it was all confusion.&nbsp; She had taken



<P>up the idea, she supposed, and made every thing bend to it.



<P>His manners, however, must have been unmarked, wavering, dubious,



<P>or she could not have been so misled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The picture!--How eager he had been about the picture!--



<P>and the charade!--and an hundred other circumstances;--



<P>how clearly they had seemed to point at Harriet.&nbsp; To be sure,



<P>the charade, with its "ready wit"--but then the "soft eyes"--



<P>in fact it suited neither; it was a jumble without taste or truth.



<P>Who could have seen through such thick-headed nonsense?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Certainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners



<P>to herself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way,



<P>as a mere error of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof



<P>among others that he had not always lived in the best society,



<P>that with all the gentleness of his address, true elegance



<P>was sometimes wanting; but, till this very day, she had never,



<P>for an instant, suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect



<P>to her as Harriet's friend.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on



<P>the subject, for the first start of its possibility.&nbsp; There was



<P>no denying that those brothers had penetration.&nbsp; She remembered



<P>what Mr. Knightley had once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution



<P>he had given, the conviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would



<P>never marry indiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer



<P>a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she



<P>had reached herself.&nbsp; It was dreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton



<P>was proving himself, in many respects, the very reverse of what she



<P>had meant and believed him; proud, assuming, conceited; very full



<P>of his own claims, and little concerned about the feelings of others.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Contrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton's wanting



<P>to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion.



<P>His professions and his proposals did him no service.&nbsp; She thought



<P>nothing of his attachment, and was insulted by his hopes.



<P>He wanted to marry well, and having the arrogance to raise his



<P>eyes to her, pretended to be in love; but she was perfectly easy



<P>as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for.



<P>There had been no real affection either in his language or manners.



<P>Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she could



<P>hardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice,



<P>less allied with real love.&nbsp; She need not trouble herself to pity

him.



<P>He only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouse



<P>of Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite



<P>so easily obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for Miss



<P>Somebody else with twenty, or with ten.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But--that he should talk of encouragement, should consider her as



<P>aware of his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short),



<P>to marry him!--should suppose himself her equal in connexion



<P>or mind!--look down upon her friend, so well understanding the



<P>gradations of rank below him, and be so blind to what rose above,



<P>as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her!--



<P>It was most provoking.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he



<P>was her inferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind.



<P>The very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it;



<P>but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly



<P>his superior.&nbsp; He must know that the Woodhouses had been settled



<P>for several generations at Hartfield, the younger branch



<P>of a very ancient family--and that the Eltons were nobody.



<P>The landed property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable,



<P>being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate, to which all



<P>the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from other sources,



<P>was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself,



<P>in every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses had long



<P>held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which



<P>Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his way



<P>as he could, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing



<P>to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility.--



<P>But he had fancied her in love with him; that evidently must



<P>have been his dependence; and after raving a little about the



<P>seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head,



<P>Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own



<P>behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging, so full of



<P>courtesy and attention, as (supposing her real motive unperceived)



<P>might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy,



<P>like Mr. Elton, in fancying himself a very decided favourite.&nbsp;

If she



<P>had so misinterpreted his feelings, she had little right to wonder



<P>that he, with self-interest to blind him, should have mistaken hers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The first error and the worst lay at her door.&nbsp; It was foolish,



<P>it was wrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two



<P>people together.&nbsp; It was adventuring too far, assuming too much,



<P>making light of what ought to be serious, a trick of what ought



<P>to be simple.&nbsp; She was quite concerned and ashamed, and resolved



<P>to do such things no more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here have I," said she, "actually talked poor Harriet into being



<P>very much attached to this man.&nbsp; She might never have thought of

him



<P>but for me; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope,



<P>if I had not assured her of his attachment, for she is as modest



<P>and humble as I used to think him.&nbsp; Oh! that I had been satisfied

with



<P>persuading her not to accept young Martin.&nbsp; There I was quite right.



<P>That was well done of me; but there I should have stopped, and left



<P>the rest to time and chance.&nbsp; I was introducing her into good company,



<P>and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having;



<P>I ought not to have attempted more.&nbsp; But now, poor girl, her peace



<P>is cut up for some time.&nbsp; I have been but half a friend to her;



<P>and if she were not to feel this disappointment so very much, I am



<P>sure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable



<P>for her;--William Coxe--Oh! no, I could not endure William Coxe--



<P>a pert young lawyer."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed



<P>a more serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been,



<P>and might be, and must be.&nbsp; The distressing explanation she had



<P>to make to Harriet, and all that poor Harriet would be suffering,



<P>with the awkwardness of future meetings, the difficulties of



<P>continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings,



<P>concealing resentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy



<P>her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer, and she went



<P>to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having



<P>blundered most dreadfully.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma's, though under



<P>temporary gloom at night, the return of day will hardly fail



<P>to bring return of spirits.&nbsp; The youth and cheerfulness of morning



<P>are in happy analogy, and of powerful operation; and if the



<P>distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed, they



<P>will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had



<P>gone to bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her,



<P>and to depend on getting tolerably out of it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really



<P>in love with her, or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking



<P>to disappoint him--that Harriet's nature should not be of that



<P>superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive--



<P>and that there could be no necessity for any body's knowing



<P>what had passed except the three principals, and especially



<P>for her father's being given a moment's uneasiness about it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal



<P>of snow on the ground did her further service, for any thing was



<P>welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder



<P>at present.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The weather was most favourable for her; though Christmas Day,



<P>she could not go to church.&nbsp; Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable



<P>had his daughter attempted it, and she was therefore safe from



<P>either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas.



<P>The ground covered with snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled



<P>state between frost and thaw, which is of all others the most



<P>unfriendly for exercise, every morning beginning in rain or snow,



<P>and every evening setting in to freeze, she was for many days a most



<P>honourable prisoner.&nbsp; No intercourse with Harriet possible but

by note;



<P>no church for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day; and no



<P>need to find excuses for Mr. Elton's absenting himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home;



<P>and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort



<P>in some society or other, it was very pleasant to have her father



<P>so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house,



<P>too wise to stir out; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no



<P>weather could keep entirely from them,--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah!&nbsp; Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr.

Elton?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These days of confinement would have been, but for her private



<P>perplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly



<P>suited her brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance



<P>to his companions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off



<P>his ill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed him



<P>during the rest of his stay at Hartfield.&nbsp; He was always agreeable



<P>and obliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body.&nbsp; But with

all



<P>the hopes of cheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay,



<P>there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation



<P>with Harriet, as made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at

ease.

<B>CHAPTER II</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family,



<P>which for the last two or three generations had been rising into



<P>gentility and property.&nbsp; He had received a good education, but,



<P>on succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become



<P>indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers



<P>were engaged, and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social



<P>temper by entering into the militia of his county, then embodied.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances



<P>of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill,



<P>of a great Yorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love



<P>with him, nobody was surprized, except her brother and his wife,



<P>who had never seen him, and who were full of pride and importance,



<P>which the connexion would offend.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command



<P>of her fortune--though her fortune bore no proportion to the



<P>family-estate--was not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it



<P>took place, to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill,



<P>who threw her off with due decorum.&nbsp; It was an unsuitable connexion,



<P>and did not produce much happiness.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston ought to have

found



<P>more in it, for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper



<P>made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness



<P>of being in love with him; but though she had one sort of spirit,



<P>she had not the best.&nbsp; She had resolution enough to pursue



<P>her own will in spite of her brother, but not enough to refrain



<P>from unreasonable regrets at that brother's unreasonable anger,



<P>nor from missing the luxuries of her former home.&nbsp; They lived beyond



<P>their income, but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe:



<P>she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at once



<P>to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,



<P>as making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst



<P>of the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years' marriage,



<P>he was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.



<P>From the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved.



<P>The boy had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering



<P>illness of his mother's, been the means of a sort of reconciliation;



<P>and Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, having no children of their own,



<P>nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for, offered to



<P>take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease.



<P>Some scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be supposed



<P>to have felt; but as they were overcome by other considerations,



<P>the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills,



<P>and he had only his own comfort to seek, and his own situation to



<P>improve as he could.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A complete change of life became desirable.&nbsp; He quitted the militia



<P>and engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a



<P>good way in London, which afforded him a favourable opening.



<P>It was a concern which brought just employment enough.&nbsp; He had

still



<P>a small house in Highbury, where most of his leisure days were spent;



<P>and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society,



<P>the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away.



<P>He had, by that time, realised an easy competence--enough to secure



<P>the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury, which he had



<P>always longed for--enough to marry a woman as portionless even



<P>as Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of his own



<P>friendly and social disposition.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence



<P>his schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth



<P>on youth, it had not shaken his determination of never settling



<P>till he could purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long



<P>looked forward to; but he had gone steadily on, with these objects



<P>in view, till they were accomplished.&nbsp; He had made his fortune,



<P>bought his house, and obtained his wife; and was beginning a new



<P>period of existence, with every probability of greater happiness



<P>than in any yet passed through.&nbsp; He had never been an unhappy man;



<P>his own temper had secured him from that, even in his first marriage;



<P>but his second must shew him how delightful a well-judging and truly



<P>amiable woman could be, and must give him the pleasantest proof



<P>of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen,



<P>to excite gratitude than to feel it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was



<P>his own; for as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought



<P>up as his uncle's heir, it had become so avowed an adoption



<P>as to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age.



<P>It was most unlikely, therefore, that he should ever want his



<P>father's assistance.&nbsp; His father had no apprehension of it.



<P>The aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her husband entirely;



<P>but it was not in Mr. Weston's nature to imagine that any caprice



<P>could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he believed,



<P>so deservedly dear.&nbsp; He saw his son every year in London,



<P>and was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine



<P>young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too.



<P>He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his



<P>merits and prospects a kind of common concern.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively



<P>curiosity to see him prevailed, though the compliment was so little



<P>returned that he had never been there in his life.&nbsp; His coming



<P>to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, upon his father's marriage, it was very generally proposed,



<P>as a most proper attention, that the visit should take place.



<P>There was not a dissentient voice on the subject, either when



<P>Mrs. Perry drank tea with Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and



<P>Miss Bates returned the visit.&nbsp; Now was the time for Mr. Frank



<P>Churchill to come among them; and the hope strengthened when it was



<P>understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion.



<P>For a few days, every morning visit in Highbury included some mention



<P>of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received.&nbsp; "I suppose you



<P>have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written



<P>to Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very handsome letter, indeed.



<P>Mr. Woodhouse told me of it.&nbsp; Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, and

he



<P>says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was, indeed, a highly prized letter.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston had, of course,



<P>formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing



<P>attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense,



<P>and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression



<P>of congratulation which her marriage had already secured.&nbsp; She

felt



<P>herself a most fortunate woman; and she had lived long enough



<P>to know how fortunate she might well be thought, where the only



<P>regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship



<P>for her had never cooled, and who could ill bear to part with her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She knew that at times she must be missed; and could not think,



<P>without pain, of Emma's losing a single pleasure, or suffering



<P>an hour's ennui, from the want of her companionableness: but dear



<P>Emma was of no feeble character; she was more equal to her situation



<P>than most girls would have been, and had sense, and energy,



<P>and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily



<P>through its little difficulties and privations.&nbsp; And then there

was



<P>such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield,



<P>so convenient for even solitary female walking, and in Mr. Weston's



<P>disposition and circumstances, which would make the approaching



<P>season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the



<P>week together.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude



<P>to Mrs. Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her



<P>satisfaction---her more than satisfaction--her cheerful enjoyment,



<P>was so just and so apparent, that Emma, well as she knew her father,



<P>was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity



<P>`poor Miss Taylor,' when they left her at Randalls in the centre



<P>of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away in the evening



<P>attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own.



<P>But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse's giving a gentle sigh,



<P>and saying, "Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was no recovering Miss Taylor--nor much likelihood of



<P>ceasing to pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation



<P>to Mr. Woodhouse.&nbsp; The compliments of his neighbours were over;



<P>he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event;



<P>and the wedding-cake, which had been a great distress to him,



<P>was all eat up.&nbsp; His own stomach could bear nothing rich, and he



<P>could never believe other people to be different from himself.



<P>What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body;



<P>and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them from having



<P>any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as earnestly



<P>tried to prevent any body's eating it.&nbsp; He had been at the pains



<P>of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject.&nbsp; Mr. Perry



<P>was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one



<P>of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse's life; and upon being applied to,



<P>he could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the



<P>bias of inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree



<P>with many--perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately.



<P>With such an opinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped



<P>to influence every visitor of the newly married pair; but still the



<P>cake was eaten; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till



<P>it was all gone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys



<P>being seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston's wedding-cake in their



<P>hands: but Mr. Woodhouse would never believe it.

<B>CHAPTER III</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way.&nbsp; He liked very

much



<P>to have his friends come and see him; and from various united causes,



<P>from his long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature,



<P>from his fortune, his house, and his daughter, he could command the



<P>visits of his own little circle, in a great measure, as he liked.



<P>He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle;



<P>his horror of late hours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit



<P>for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms.



<P>Fortunately for him, Highbury, including Randalls in the same parish,



<P>and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley,



<P>comprehended many such.&nbsp; Not unfrequently, through Emma's persuasion,



<P>he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him: but evening



<P>parties were what he preferred; and, unless he fancied himself at any



<P>time unequal to company, there was scarcely an evening in the week



<P>in which Emma could not make up a card-table for him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley;



<P>and by Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it,



<P>the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude



<P>for the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse's drawing-room,



<P>and the smiles of his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being



<P>thrown away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able



<P>of whom were Mrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies



<P>almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield,



<P>and who were fetched and carried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse



<P>thought it no hardship for either James or the horses.&nbsp; Had it



<P>taken place only once a year, it would have been a grievance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a



<P>very old lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille.



<P>She lived with her single daughter in a very small way, and was



<P>considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady,



<P>under such untoward circumstances, can excite.&nbsp; Her daughter enjoyed



<P>a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young,



<P>handsome, rich, nor married.&nbsp; Miss Bates stood in the very worst



<P>predicament in the world for having much of the public favour;



<P>and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself,



<P>or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect.



<P>She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness.&nbsp; Her youth



<P>had passed without distinction, and her middle of life was devoted



<P>to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a small



<P>income go as far as possible.&nbsp; And yet she was a happy woman,



<P>and a woman whom no one named without good-will.&nbsp; It was her own



<P>universal good-will and contented temper which worked such wonders.



<P>She loved every body, was interested in every body's happiness,



<P>quicksighted to every body's merits; thought herself a most fortunate



<P>creature, and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother,



<P>and so many good neighbours and friends, and a home that wanted



<P>for nothing.&nbsp; The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature,



<P>her contented and grateful spirit, were a recommendation to every body,



<P>and a mine of felicity to herself.&nbsp; She was a great talker upon



<P>little matters, which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial



<P>communications and harmless gossip.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School--not of a seminary,



<P>or an establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences

of



<P>refined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality,



<P>upon new principles and new systems--and where young ladies for



<P>enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity--but



<P>a real, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable



<P>quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price,



<P>and where girls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble



<P>themselves into a little education, without any danger of coming



<P>back prodigies.&nbsp; Mrs. Goddard's school was in high repute--and



<P>very deservedly; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy



<P>spot: she had an ample house and garden, gave the children plenty



<P>of wholesome food, let them run about a great deal in the summer,



<P>and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands.



<P>It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked



<P>after her to church.&nbsp; She was a plain, motherly kind of woman,



<P>who had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled



<P>to the occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly



<P>owed much to Mr. Woodhouse's kindness, felt his particular claim



<P>on her to leave her neat parlour, hung round with fancy-work,



<P>whenever she could, and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently



<P>able to collect; and happy was she, for her father's sake,



<P>in the power; though, as far as she was herself concerned,



<P>it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs. Weston.&nbsp; She was delighted



<P>to see her father look comfortable, and very much pleased with



<P>herself for contriving things so well; but the quiet prosings



<P>of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent



<P>was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As she sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close



<P>of the present day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting,



<P>in most respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her;



<P>a most welcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen,



<P>whom Emma knew very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in,



<P>on account of her beauty.&nbsp; A very gracious invitation was returned,



<P>and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody.&nbsp; Somebody had



<P>placed her, several years back, at Mrs. Goddard's school,



<P>and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar



<P>to that of parlour-boarder. This was all that was generally known



<P>of her history.&nbsp; She had no visible friends but what had been



<P>acquired at Highbury, and was now just returned from a long visit



<P>in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with

her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was a very pretty girl, and her beauty happened to be of a sort



<P>which Emma particularly admired.&nbsp; She was short, plump, and fair,



<P>with a fine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features,



<P>and a look of great sweetness, and, before the end of the evening,



<P>Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person, and quite



<P>determined to continue the acquaintance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith's



<P>conversation, but she found her altogether very engaging--not



<P>inconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk--and yet so far from pushing,



<P>shewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly



<P>grateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly



<P>impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style



<P>to what she had been used to, that she must have good sense,



<P>and deserve encouragement.&nbsp; Encouragement should be given.



<P>Those soft blue eyes, and all those natural graces, should not be



<P>wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions.



<P>The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her.



<P>The friends from whom she had just parted, though very good sort



<P>of people, must be doing her harm.&nbsp; They were a family of the name



<P>of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a large farm



<P>of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell--very creditably,



<P>she believed--she knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of them--but they



<P>must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the intimates



<P>of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance



<P>to be quite perfect.&nbsp; She would notice her; she would improve her;



<P>she would detach her from her bad acquaintance, and introduce her



<P>into good society; she would form her opinions and her manners.



<P>It would be an interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking;



<P>highly becoming her own situation in life, her leisure, and powers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking



<P>and listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that



<P>the evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table,



<P>which always closed such parties, and for which she had been



<P>used to sit and watch the due time, was all set out and ready,



<P>and moved forwards to the fire, before she was aware.&nbsp; With an



<P>alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never



<P>indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively,



<P>with the real good-will of a mind delighted with its own ideas,



<P>did she then do all the honours of the meal, and help and recommend



<P>the minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an urgency which she



<P>knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their

guests.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare.



<P>He loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion



<P>of his youth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome



<P>made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his



<P>hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing,



<P>his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that



<P>he could, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he



<P>might constrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing



<P>the nicer things, to say:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs.



<P>An egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome.&nbsp; Serle understands

boiling



<P>an egg better than any body.&nbsp; I would not recommend an egg boiled



<P>by any body else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small,



<P>you see--one of our small eggs will not hurt you.&nbsp; Miss Bates,



<P>let Emma help you to a little bit of tart--a very little bit.



<P>Ours are all apple-tarts. You need not be afraid of unwholesome



<P>preserves here.&nbsp; I do not advise the custard.&nbsp; Mrs. Goddard,

what say



<P>you to half a glass of wine? A small half-glass, put into a tumbler



<P>of water? I do not think it could disagree with you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma allowed her father to talk--but supplied her visitors in



<P>a much more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had



<P>particular pleasure in sending them away happy.&nbsp; The happiness



<P>of Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions.&nbsp; Miss Woodhouse



<P>was so great a personage in Highbury, that the prospect of the



<P>introduction had given as much panic as pleasure; but the humble,



<P>grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings,



<P>delighted with the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated



<P>her all the evening, and actually shaken hands with her at last!

<B>CHAPTER XVII</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield.



<P>The weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move;



<P>and Mr. Woodhouse having, as usual, tried to persuade his daughter



<P>to stay behind with all her children, was obliged to see the whole



<P>party set off, and return to his lamentations over the destiny



<P>of poor Isabella;--which poor Isabella, passing her life with



<P>those she doated on, full of their merits, blind to their faults,



<P>and always innocently busy, might have been a model of right



<P>feminine happiness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note



<P>from Mr. Elton to Mr. Woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note,



<P>to say, with Mr. Elton's best compliments, "that he was proposing



<P>to leave Highbury the following morning in his way to Bath;



<P>where, in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends,



<P>he had engaged to spend a few weeks, and very much regretted



<P>the impossibility he was under, from various circumstances of



<P>weather and business, of taking a personal leave of Mr. Woodhouse,



<P>of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense--



<P>and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands, should be happy to attend to them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma was most agreeably surprized.--Mr. Elton's absence just



<P>at this time was the very thing to be desired.&nbsp; She admired



<P>him for contriving it, though not able to give him much credit



<P>for the manner in which it was announced.&nbsp; Resentment could not



<P>have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father,



<P>from which she was so pointedly excluded.&nbsp; She had not even a



<P>share in his opening compliments.--Her name was not mentioned;--



<P>and there was so striking a change in all this, and such an



<P>ill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his graceful acknowledgments,



<P>as she thought, at first, could not escape her father's suspicion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It did, however.--Her father was quite taken up with the surprize



<P>of so sudden a journey, and his fears that Mr. Elton might never get



<P>safely to the end of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in his language.



<P>It was a very useful note, for it supplied them with fresh matter



<P>for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening.



<P>Mr. Woodhouse talked over his alarms, and Emma was in spirits



<P>to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark.&nbsp; She had



<P>reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold, and it was



<P>desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting



<P>the better of her other complaint before the gentleman's return.



<P>She went to Mrs. Goddard's accordingly the very next day, to undergo



<P>the necessary penance of communication; and a severe one it was.--



<P>She had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously



<P>feeding--to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred--



<P>and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis-judging in all her



<P>ideas on one subject, all her observations, all her convictions,



<P>all her prophecies for the last six weeks.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The confession completely renewed her first shame--and the sight



<P>of Harriet's tears made her think that she should never be in charity



<P>with herself again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet bore the intelligence very well--blaming nobody--



<P>and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition



<P>and lowly opinion of herself, as must appear with particular



<P>advantage at that moment to her friend.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost;



<P>and all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching,



<P>seemed on Harriet's side, not her own.&nbsp; Harriet did not consider



<P>herself as having any thing to complain of.&nbsp; The affection of such



<P>a man as Mr. Elton would have been too great a distinction.--



<P>She never could have deserved him--and nobody but so partial



<P>and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her tears fell abundantly--but her grief was so truly artless,



<P>that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma's eyes--



<P>and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart



<P>and understanding--really for the time convinced that Harriet was



<P>the superior creature of the two--and that to resemble her would



<P>be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or



<P>intelligence could do.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded



<P>and ignorant; but she left her with every previous resolution



<P>confirmed of being humble and discreet, and repressing imagination



<P>all the rest of her life.&nbsp; Her second duty now, inferior only to

her



<P>father's claims, was to promote Harriet's comfort, and endeavour



<P>to prove her own affection in some better method than by match-making.



<P>She got her to Hartfield, and shewed her the most unvarying kindness,



<P>striving to occupy and amuse her, and by books and conversation,



<P>to drive Mr. Elton from her thoughts.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Time, she knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; and

she



<P>could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general,



<P>and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton



<P>in particular; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet's age,



<P>and with the entire extinction of all hope, such a progress might be



<P>made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton's return,



<P>as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance,



<P>without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet did think him all perfection, and maintained the non-existence



<P>of any body equal to him in person or goodness--and did, in truth,



<P>prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen;



<P>but yet it appeared to her so natural, so inevitable to strive



<P>against an inclination of that sort unrequited, that she could not



<P>comprehend its continuing very long in equal force.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If Mr. Elton, on his return, made his own indifference as evident



<P>and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do,



<P>she could not imagine Harriet's persisting to place her happiness



<P>in the sight or the recollection of him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Their being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was bad



<P>for each, for all three.&nbsp; Not one of them had the power of removal,



<P>or of effecting any material change of society.&nbsp; They must encounter



<P>each other, and make the best of it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at



<P>Mrs. Goddard's; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers



<P>and great girls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only



<P>that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling



<P>moderation or repellent truth.&nbsp; Where the wound had been given,



<P>there must the cure be found if anywhere; and Emma felt that,



<P>till she saw her in the way of cure, there could be no true peace



<P>for herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P><B>CHAPTER I</B>

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home



<P>and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings



<P>of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world



<P>with very little to distress or vex her.



<P>She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate,



<P>indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her sister's marriage,



<P>been mistress of his house from a very early period.&nbsp; Her mother



<P>had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct



<P>remembrance of her caresses; and her place had been supplied



<P>by an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short



<P>of a mother in affection.



<P>Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family,



<P>less as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters,



<P>but particularly of Emma.&nbsp; Between them it was more the intimacy



<P>of sisters.&nbsp; Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal



<P>office of governess, the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed



<P>her to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being



<P>now long passed away, they had been living together as friend and



<P>friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she liked;



<P>highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but directed chiefly by



<P>her own.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having



<P>rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little



<P>too well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened



<P>alloy to her many enjoyments.&nbsp; The danger, however, was at present



<P>so unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes



<P>with her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sorrow came--a gentle sorrow--but not at all in the shape of any



<P>disagreeable consciousness.--Miss Taylor married.&nbsp; It was Miss



<P>Taylor's loss which first brought grief.&nbsp; It was on the wedding-day



<P>of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought



<P>of any continuance.&nbsp; The wedding over, and the bride-people gone,



<P>her father and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect



<P>of a third to cheer a long evening.&nbsp; Her father composed himself



<P>to sleep after dinner, as usual, and she had then only to sit



<P>and think of what she had lost.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The event had every promise of happiness for her friend.&nbsp; Mr. Weston



<P>was a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age,



<P>and pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering



<P>with what self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished



<P>and promoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her.



<P>The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day.



<P>She recalled her past kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteen



<P>years--how she had taught and how she had played with her from five



<P>years old--how she had devoted all her powers to attach and amuse



<P>her in health--and how nursed her through the various illnesses



<P>of childhood.&nbsp; A large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the



<P>intercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect



<P>unreserve which had soon followed Isabella's marriage, on their



<P>being left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection.



<P>She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent,



<P>well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family,



<P>interested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself,



<P>in every pleasure, every scheme of hers--one to whom she could speak



<P>every thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her



<P>as could never find fault.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>How was she to bear the change?--It was true that her friend was



<P>going only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must



<P>be the difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them,



<P>and a Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages,



<P>natural and domestic, she was now in great danger of suffering



<P>from intellectual solitude.&nbsp; She dearly loved her father, but he



<P>was no companion for her.&nbsp; He could not meet her in conversation,



<P>rational or playful.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had



<P>not married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;



<P>for having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity



<P>of mind or body, he was a much older man in ways than in years;



<P>and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart



<P>and his amiable temper, his talents could not have recommended him



<P>at any time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony,



<P>being settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond



<P>her daily reach; and many a long October and November evening must



<P>be struggled through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next



<P>visit from Isabella and her husband, and their little children,



<P>to fill the house, and give her pleasant society again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,



<P>to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies,



<P>and name, did really belong, afforded her no equals.&nbsp; The Woodhouses



<P>were first in consequence there.&nbsp; All looked up to them.&nbsp;

She had



<P>many acquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil,



<P>but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss



<P>Taylor for even half a day.&nbsp; It was a melancholy change; and Emma



<P>could not but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things,



<P>till her father awoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful.



<P>His spirits required support.&nbsp; He was a nervous man, easily depressed;



<P>fond of every body that he was used to, and hating to part with them;



<P>hating change of every kind.&nbsp; Matrimony, as the origin of change,



<P>was always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled



<P>to his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her but



<P>with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection,



<P>when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from



<P>his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to



<P>suppose that other people could feel differently from himself,



<P>he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad



<P>a thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great deal



<P>happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield.



<P>Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him



<P>from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for him



<P>not to say exactly as he had said at dinner,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish she were here again.&nbsp; What a pity it



<P>is that Mr. Weston ever thought of her!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot.&nbsp; Mr. Weston

is such



<P>a good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves



<P>a good wife;--and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us



<P>for ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of

her own?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A house of her own!--But where is the advantage of a house of her own?



<P>This is three times as large.--And you have never any odd humours,



<P>my dear."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see



<P>us!--We shall be always meeting! We must begin; we must go and pay



<P>wedding visit very soon."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance.



<P>I could not walk half so far."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, papa, nobody thought of your walking.&nbsp; We must go in the carriage,



<P>to be sure."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for



<P>such a little way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we



<P>are paying our visit?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They are to be put into Mr. Weston's stable, papa.&nbsp; You know we



<P>have settled all that already.&nbsp; We talked it all over with Mr.

Weston



<P>last night.&nbsp; And as for James, you may be very sure he will always

like



<P>going to Randalls, because of his daughter's being housemaid there.



<P>I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else.&nbsp; That

was



<P>your doing, papa.&nbsp; You got Hannah that good place.&nbsp; Nobody

thought



<P>of Hannah till you mentioned her--James is so obliged to you!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am very glad I did think of her.&nbsp; It was very lucky, for I would



<P>not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account;



<P>and I am sure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil,



<P>pretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of her.&nbsp; Whenever I

see her,



<P>she always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner;



<P>and when you have had her here to do needlework, I observe she



<P>always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it.



<P>I am sure she will be an excellent servant; and it will be a great



<P>comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is



<P>used to see.&nbsp; Whenever James goes over to see his daughter, you

know,



<P>she will be hearing of us.&nbsp; He will be able to tell her how we



<P>all are."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas,



<P>and hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably



<P>through the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own.



<P>The backgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards



<P>walked in and made it unnecessary.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not



<P>only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly



<P>connected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's husband.



<P>He lived about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor,



<P>and always welcome, and at this time more welcome than usual,



<P>as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London.&nbsp; He

had



<P>returned to a late dinner, after some days' absence, and now walked



<P>up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square.



<P>It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr. Woodhouse for some time.



<P>Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which always did him good;



<P>and his many inquiries after "poor Isabella" and her children were



<P>answered most satisfactorily.&nbsp; When this was over, Mr. Woodhouse



<P>gratefully observed, "It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley, to come



<P>out at this late hour to call upon us.&nbsp; I am afraid you must have



<P>had a shocking walk."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not at all, sir.&nbsp; It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild



<P>that I must draw back from your great fire."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But you must have found it very damp and dirty.&nbsp; I wish you may



<P>not catch cold."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes.&nbsp; Not a speck on them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal



<P>of rain here.&nbsp; It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour



<P>while we were at breakfast.&nbsp; I wanted them to put off the wedding."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"By the bye--I have not wished you joy.&nbsp; Being pretty well aware



<P>of what sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry



<P>with my congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well.



<P>How did you all behave? Who cried most?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! poor Miss Taylor! 'Tis a sad business."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly



<P>say `poor Miss Taylor.' I have a great regard for you and Emma;



<P>but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!--At



<P>any rate, it must be better to have only one to please than two."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Especially when one of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome creature!"



<P>said Emma playfully.&nbsp; "That is what you have in your head,



<P>I know--and what you would certainly say if my father were not by."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed," said Mr. Woodhouse,



<P>with a sigh.&nbsp; "I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean you, or suppose



<P>Mr. Knightley to mean you.&nbsp; What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant



<P>only myself.&nbsp; Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know--



<P>in a joke--it is all a joke.&nbsp; We always say what we like to one

another."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see



<P>faults in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them:



<P>and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself,



<P>she knew it would be so much less so to her father, that she would



<P>not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being



<P>thought perfect by every body.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Emma knows I never flatter her," said Mr. Knightley, "but I



<P>meant no reflection on any body.&nbsp; Miss Taylor has been used



<P>to have two persons to please; she will now have but one.



<P>The chances are that she must be a gainer."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well," said Emma, willing to let it pass--"you want to hear



<P>about the wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all



<P>behaved charmingly.&nbsp; Every body was punctual, every body in their



<P>best looks: not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen.&nbsp; Oh

no;



<P>we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart,



<P>and were sure of meeting every day."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dear Emma bears every thing so well," said her father.



<P>"But, Mr. Knightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor,



<P>and I am sure she will miss her more than she thinks for."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles.



<P>"It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,"



<P>said Mr. Knightley.&nbsp; "We should not like her so well as we do,

sir,



<P>if we could suppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to



<P>Miss Taylor's advantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be,



<P>at Miss Taylor's time of life, to be settled in a home of her own,



<P>and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision,



<P>and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure.



<P>Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily



<P>married."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me," said Emma,



<P>"and a very considerable one--that I made the match myself.



<P>I made the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place,



<P>and be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would



<P>never marry again, may comfort me for any thing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Knightley shook his head at her.&nbsp; Her father fondly replied,



<P>"Ah! my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things,



<P>for whatever you say always comes to pass.&nbsp; Pray do not make any



<P>more matches."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed,



<P>for other people.&nbsp; It is the greatest amusement in the world! And



<P>after such success, you know!--Every body said that Mr. Weston would



<P>never marry again.&nbsp; Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower



<P>so long, and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife,



<P>so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his



<P>friends here, always acceptable wherever he went, always cheerful--



<P>Mr. Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did



<P>not like it.&nbsp; Oh no! Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again.



<P>Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed,



<P>and others of the son and the uncle not letting him.&nbsp; All manner



<P>of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject, but I believed none



<P>of it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ever since the day--about four years ago--that Miss Taylor and I



<P>met with him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle,



<P>he darted away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas



<P>for us from Farmer Mitchell's, I made up my mind on the subject.



<P>I planned the match from that hour; and when such success has blessed



<P>me in this instance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave



<P>off match-making."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not understand what you mean by `success,'" said Mr. Knightley.



<P>"Success supposes endeavour.&nbsp; Your time has been properly and



<P>delicately spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four



<P>years to bring about this marriage.&nbsp; A worthy employment for a

young



<P>lady's mind! But if, which I rather imagine, your making the match,



<P>as you call it, means only your planning it, your saying to yourself



<P>one idle day, `I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor



<P>if Mr. Weston were to marry her,' and saying it again to yourself



<P>every now and then afterwards, why do you talk of success? Where



<P>is your merit? What are you proud of? You made a lucky guess;



<P>and that is all that can be said."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?--



<P>I pity you.--I thought you cleverer--for, depend upon it a lucky



<P>guess is never merely luck.&nbsp; There is always some talent in it.



<P>And as to my poor word `success,' which you quarrel with, I do not



<P>know that I am so entirely without any claim to it.&nbsp; You have drawn



<P>two pretty pictures; but I think there may be a third--a something



<P>between the do-nothing and the do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston's



<P>visits here, and given many little encouragements, and smoothed



<P>many little matters, it might not have come to any thing after all.



<P>I think you must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,



<P>unaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their



<P>own concerns.&nbsp; You are more likely to have done harm to yourself,



<P>than good to them, by interference."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,"



<P>rejoined Mr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part.&nbsp; "But, my dear,



<P>pray do not make any more matches; they are silly things, and break

up



<P>one's family circle grievously."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton.&nbsp; Poor Mr. Elton! You



<P>like Mr. Elton, papa,--I must look about for a wife for him.



<P>There is nobody in Highbury who deserves him--and he has been



<P>here a whole year, and has fitted up his house so comfortably,



<P>that it would be a shame to have him single any longer--and I thought



<P>when he was joining their hands to-day, he looked so very much as if



<P>he would like to have the same kind office done for him! I think



<P>very well of Mr. Elton, and this is the only way I have of doing



<P>him a service."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very



<P>good young man, and I have a great regard for him.&nbsp; But if you



<P>want to shew him any attention, my dear, ask him to come



<P>and dine with us some day.&nbsp; That will be a much better thing.



<P>I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to meet him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time," said Mr. Knightley,



<P>laughing, "and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much



<P>better thing.&nbsp; Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the

best



<P>of the fish and the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife.



<P>Depend upon it, a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care



<P>of himself."

<B>CHAPTER XV</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea; and when he had drank his



<P>tea he was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his three



<P>companions could do, to entertain away his notice of the lateness



<P>of the hour, before the other gentlemen appeared.&nbsp; Mr. Weston was



<P>chatty and convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort;



<P>but at last the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation.



<P>Mr. Elton, in very good spirits, was one of the first to walk in.



<P>Mrs. Weston and Emma were sitting together on a sofa.&nbsp; He joined



<P>them immediately, and, with scarcely an invitation, seated himself



<P>between them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind



<P>by the expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget



<P>his late improprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before,



<P>and on his making Harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen



<P>with most friendly smiles.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend--



<P>her fair, lovely, amiable friend.&nbsp; "Did she know?--had she



<P>heard any thing about her, since their being at Randalls?--



<P>he felt much anxiety--he must confess that the nature of her



<P>complaint alarmed him considerably."&nbsp; And in this style he talked



<P>on for some time very properly, not much attending to any answer,



<P>but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat;



<P>and Emma was quite in charity with him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if



<P>he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account,



<P>than on Harriet's--more anxious that she should escape the infection,



<P>than that there should be no infection in the complaint.&nbsp; He began



<P>with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting



<P>the sick-chamber again, for the present--to entreat her to promise



<P>him not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry



<P>and learnt his opinion; and though she tried to laugh it off



<P>and bring the subject back into its proper course, there was no



<P>putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her.&nbsp; She was vexed.



<P>It did appear--there was no concealing it--exactly like the pretence



<P>of being in love with her, instead of Harriet; an inconstancy,



<P>if real, the most contemptible and abominable! and she had difficulty



<P>in behaving with temper.&nbsp; He turned to Mrs. Weston to implore



<P>her assistance, "Would not she give him her support?--would not she



<P>add her persuasions to his, to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go



<P>to Mrs. Goddard's till it were certain that Miss Smith's disorder



<P>had no infection?&nbsp; He could not be satisfied without a promise--



<P>would not she give him her influence in procuring it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So scrupulous for others," he continued, "and yet so careless



<P>for herself!&nbsp; She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home

to-day,



<P>and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated



<P>sore throat herself.&nbsp; Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?--Judge between

us.



<P>Have not I some right to complain?&nbsp; I am sure of your kind support



<P>and aid."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma saw Mrs. Weston's surprize, and felt that it must be great,



<P>at an address which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself



<P>the right of first interest in her; and as for herself, she was



<P>too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly



<P>saying any thing to the purpose.&nbsp; She could only give him a look;



<P>but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses,



<P>and then left the sofa, removing to a seat by her sister, and giving



<P>her all her attention.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly



<P>did another subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came



<P>into the room from examining the weather, and opened on them



<P>all with the information of the ground being covered with snow,



<P>and of its still snowing fast, with a strong drifting wind;



<P>concluding with these words to Mr. Woodhouse:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements,



<P>sir.&nbsp; Something new for your coachman and horses to be making



<P>their way through a storm of snow."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Poor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else



<P>had something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized,



<P>and had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston



<P>and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention



<P>from his son-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I admired your resolution very much, sir," said he, "in venturing



<P>out in such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow



<P>very soon.&nbsp; Every body must have seen the snow coming on.



<P>I admired your spirit; and I dare say we shall get home very well.



<P>Another hour or two's snow can hardly make the road impassable;



<P>and we are two carriages; if one is blown over in the bleak part



<P>of the common field there will be the other at hand.&nbsp; I dare say

we



<P>shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he



<P>had known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word,



<P>lest it should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse



<P>for his hurrying away.&nbsp; As to there being any quantity of snow

fallen



<P>or likely to fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke;



<P>he was afraid they would find no difficulty.&nbsp; He wished the road

might



<P>be impassable, that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls;



<P>and with the utmost good-will was sure that accommodation might



<P>be found for every body, calling on his wife to agree with him,



<P>that with a little contrivance, every body might be lodged,



<P>which she hardly knew how to do, from the consciousness of there



<P>being but two spare rooms in the house.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What is to be done, my dear Emma?--what is to be done?"



<P>was Mr. Woodhouse's first exclamation, and all that he could say



<P>for some time.&nbsp; To her he looked for comfort; and her assurances



<P>of safety, her representation of the excellence of the horses,



<P>and of James, and of their having so many friends about them,



<P>revived him a little.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His eldest daughter's alarm was equal to his own.&nbsp; The horror of



<P>being blocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield,



<P>was full in her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just



<P>passable for adventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay,



<P>she was eager to have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain



<P>at Randalls, while she and her husband set forward instantly through



<P>all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You had better order the carriage directly, my love," said she;



<P>"I dare say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly;



<P>and if we do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk.



<P>I am not at all afraid.&nbsp; I should not mind walking half the way.



<P>I could change my shoes, you know, the moment I got home; and it is

not



<P>the sort of thing that gives me cold."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed!" replied he.&nbsp; "Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most



<P>extraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every



<P>thing does give you cold.&nbsp; Walk home!--you are prettily shod



<P>for walking home, I dare say.&nbsp; It will be bad enough for the horses."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Isabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan.



<P>Mrs. Weston could only approve.&nbsp; Isabella then went to Emma;



<P>but Emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being



<P>all able to get away; and they were still discussing the point,



<P>when Mr. Knightley, who had left the room immediately after his



<P>brother's first report of the snow, came back again, and told them



<P>that he had been out of doors to examine, and could answer for there



<P>not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home, whenever they



<P>liked it, either now or an hour hence.&nbsp; He had gone beyond the

sweep--



<P>some way along the Highbury road--the snow was nowhere above half



<P>an inch deep--in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground;



<P>a very few flakes were falling at present, but the clouds were parting,



<P>and there was every appearance of its being soon over.&nbsp; He had

seen



<P>the coachmen, and they both agreed with him in there being nothing



<P>to apprehend.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they



<P>were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father's account,



<P>who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous



<P>constitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not



<P>be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued



<P>at Randalls.&nbsp; He was satisfied of there being no present danger

in



<P>returning home, but no assurances could convince him that it was safe



<P>to stay; and while the others were variously urging and recommending,



<P>Mr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences:&nbsp; thus--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am ready, if the others are."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Shall I ring the bell?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for.&nbsp; A few



<P>minutes more, and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion



<P>deposited in his own house, to get sober and cool, and the other



<P>recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The carriage came:&nbsp; and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object

on



<P>such occasions, was carefully attended to his own by Mr. Knightley



<P>and Mr. Weston; but not all that either could say could prevent some



<P>renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen,



<P>and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for.



<P>"He was afraid they should have a very bad drive.&nbsp; He was afraid



<P>poor Isabella would not like it.&nbsp; And there would be poor Emma



<P>in the carriage behind.&nbsp; He did not know what they had best do.



<P>They must keep as much together as they could;" and James was talked

to,



<P>and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Isabella stept in after her father; John Knightley, forgetting that

he



<P>did not belong to their party, stept in after his wife very naturally;



<P>so that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into the second



<P>carriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut on them,



<P>and that they were to have a tete-a-tete drive.&nbsp; It would not have

been



<P>the awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure,



<P>previous to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked



<P>to him of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have



<P>seemed but one.&nbsp; But now, she would rather it had not happened.



<P>She believed he had been drinking too much of Mr. Weston's good wine,



<P>and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was



<P>immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity



<P>of the weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had



<P>they passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she



<P>found her subject cut up--her hand seized--her attention demanded,



<P>and Mr. Elton actually making violent love to her:&nbsp; availing himself



<P>of the precious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already



<P>well known, hoping--fearing--adoring--ready to die if she refused him;



<P>but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled



<P>love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect,



<P>and in short, very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon



<P>as possible.&nbsp; It really was so.&nbsp; Without scruple--without

apology--



<P>without much apparent diffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet,



<P>was professing himself her lover.&nbsp; She tried to stop him; but vainly;



<P>he would go on, and say it all.&nbsp; Angry as she was, the thought

of



<P>the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak.



<P>She felt that half this folly must be drunkenness, and therefore



<P>could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour.



<P>Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the playful, which she



<P>hoped would best suit his half and half state, she replied,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton.&nbsp; This to me! you forget

yourself--



<P>you take me for my friend--any message to Miss Smith I shall



<P>be happy to deliver; but no more of this to me, if you please."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Miss Smith!--message to Miss Smith!--What could she possibly mean!"--



<P>And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent, such boastful



<P>pretence of amazement, that she could not help replying with quickness,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account



<P>for it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak



<P>either to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner.&nbsp; Command yourself



<P>enough to say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits,



<P>not at all to confuse his intellects.&nbsp; He perfectly knew his own

meaning;



<P>and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious,



<P>and slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,--



<P>but acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned



<P>at all,--he resumed the subject of his own passion, and was very



<P>urgent for a favourable answer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of his inconstancy



<P>and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness, replied,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is impossible for me to doubt any longer.&nbsp; You have made



<P>yourself too clear.&nbsp; Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond



<P>any thing I can express.&nbsp; After such behaviour, as I have witnessed



<P>during the last month, to Miss Smith--such attentions as I



<P>have been in the daily habit of observing--to be addressing me



<P>in this manner--this is an unsteadiness of character, indeed,



<P>which I had not supposed possible!&nbsp; Believe me, sir, I am far,



<P>very far, from gratified in being the object of such professions."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Good Heaven!" cried Mr. Elton, "what can be the meaning of this?--



<P>Miss Smith!--I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course



<P>of my existence--never paid her any attentions, but as your friend:



<P>never cared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend.



<P>If she has fancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her,



<P>and I am very sorry--extremely sorry--But, Miss Smith, indeed!--Oh!



<P>Miss Woodhouse! who can think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse



<P>is near!&nbsp; No, upon my honour, there is no unsteadiness of character.



<P>I have thought only of you.&nbsp; I protest against having paid the

smallest



<P>attention to any one else.&nbsp; Every thing that I have said or done,



<P>for many weeks past, has been with the sole view of marking my



<P>adoration of yourself.&nbsp; You cannot really, seriously, doubt it.



<P>No!--(in an accent meant to be insinuating)--I am sure you have seen



<P>and understood me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this--



<P>which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost.&nbsp; She was



<P>too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply:



<P>and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton's



<P>sanguine state of mind, he tried to take her hand again, as he



<P>joyously exclaimed--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting silence.



<P>It confesses that you have long understood me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, sir," cried Emma, "it confesses no such thing.&nbsp; So far from



<P>having long understood you, I have been in a most complete error



<P>with respect to your views, till this moment.&nbsp; As to myself, I

am



<P>very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings--



<P>Nothing could be farther from my wishes--your attachment to my



<P>friend Harriet--your pursuit of her, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me



<P>great pleasure, and I have been very earnestly wishing you success:



<P>but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield,



<P>I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits



<P>so frequent.&nbsp; Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend



<P>yourself particularly to Miss Smith?--that you have never thought



<P>seriously of her?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Never, madam," cried he, affronted in his turn:&nbsp; "never, I assure

you.



<P>I think seriously of Miss Smith!--Miss Smith is a very good sort



<P>of girl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled.



<P>I wish her extremely well:&nbsp; and, no doubt, there are men who might

not



<P>object to--Every body has their level:&nbsp; but as for myself, I am

not,



<P>I think, quite so much at a loss.&nbsp; I need not so totally despair



<P>of an equal alliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!--



<P>No, madam, my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only;



<P>and the encouragement I received--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Encouragement!--I give you encouragement!--Sir, you have been entirely



<P>mistaken in supposing it.&nbsp; I have seen you only as the admirer



<P>of my friend.&nbsp; In no other light could you have been more to me

than



<P>a common acquaintance.&nbsp; I am exceedingly sorry:&nbsp; but it is

well that



<P>the mistake ends where it does.&nbsp; Had the same behaviour continued,



<P>Miss Smith might have been led into a misconception of your views;



<P>not being aware, probably, any more than myself, of the very



<P>great inequality which you are so sensible of.&nbsp; But, as it is,



<P>the disappointment is single, and, I trust, will not be lasting.



<P>I have no thoughts of matrimony at present."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided



<P>to invite supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment,



<P>and mutually deep mortification, they had to continue together a few



<P>minutes longer, for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them



<P>to a foot-pace. If there had not been so much anger, there would have



<P>been desperate awkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left



<P>no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment.&nbsp; Without knowing



<P>when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped,



<P>they found themselves, all at once, at the door of his house;



<P>and he was out before another syllable passed.--Emma then felt it



<P>indispensable to wish him a good night.&nbsp; The compliment was just

returned,



<P>coldly and proudly; and, under indescribable irritation of spirits,



<P>she was then conveyed to Hartfield.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There she was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her father,



<P>who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from



<P>Vicarage Lane--turning a corner which he could never bear to think of--



<P>and in strange hands--a mere common coachman--no James; and there it



<P>seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well:



<P>for Mr. John Knightley, ashamed of his ill-humour, was now all



<P>kindness and attention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort



<P>of her father, as to seem--if not quite ready to join him in a basin



<P>of gruel--perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome;



<P>and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little

party,



<P>except herself.--But her mind had never been in such perturbation;



<P>and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful

till



<P>the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection.

<B>CHAPTER XIV</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman



<P>as they walked into Mrs. Weston's drawing-room;--Mr. Elton must



<P>compose his joyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his



<P>ill-humour. Mr. Elton must smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more,



<P>to fit them for the place.--Emma only might be as nature prompted,



<P>and shew herself just as happy as she was.&nbsp; To her it was real



<P>enjoyment to be with the Westons.&nbsp; Mr. Weston was a great favourite,



<P>and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with



<P>such unreserve, as to his wife; not any one, to whom she related



<P>with such conviction of being listened to and understood, of being



<P>always interesting and always intelligible, the little affairs,



<P>arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her father and herself.



<P>She could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston had not



<P>a lively concern; and half an hour's uninterrupted communication



<P>of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private



<P>life depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day's visit might



<P>not afford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour;



<P>but the very sight of Mrs. Weston, her smile, her touch, her voice



<P>was grateful to Emma, and she determined to think as little as



<P>possible of Mr. Elton's oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant,



<P>and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The misfortune of Harriet's cold had been pretty well gone through



<P>before her arrival.&nbsp; Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long



<P>enough to give the history of it, besides all the history of his own



<P>and Isabella's coming, and of Emma's being to follow, and had indeed



<P>just got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come



<P>and see his daughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston,



<P>who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him,



<P>was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her rather



<P>sorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he was



<P>close to her.&nbsp; The difficulty was great of driving his strange



<P>insensibility towards Harriet, from her mind, while he not only sat



<P>at her elbow, but was continually obtruding his happy countenance



<P>on her notice, and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion.



<P>Instead of forgetting him, his behaviour was such that she could



<P>not avoid the internal suggestion of "Can it really be as my brother



<P>imagined? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer



<P>his affections from Harriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!"--



<P>Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm, would be



<P>so interested about her father, and so delighted with Mrs. Weston;



<P>and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal



<P>and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would-be lover,



<P>and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners.



<P>For her own sake she could not be rude; and for Harriet's, in the hope



<P>that all would yet turn out right, she was even positively civil;



<P>but it was an effort; especially as something was going on amongst



<P>the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton's nonsense,



<P>which she particularly wished to listen to.&nbsp; She heard enough



<P>to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son;



<P>she heard the words "my son," and "Frank," and "my son,"



<P>repeated several times over; and, from a few other half-syllables



<P>very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from



<P>his son; but before she could quiet Mr. Elton, the subject was



<P>so completely past that any reviving question from her would have



<P>been awkward.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma's resolution of never marrying,



<P>there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank Churchill,



<P>which always interested her.&nbsp; She had frequently thought--especially

since



<P>his father's marriage with Miss Taylor--that if she were to marry,



<P>he was the very person to suit her in age, character and condition.



<P>He seemed by this connexion between the families, quite to belong to

her.



<P>She could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew



<P>them must think of.&nbsp; That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it,

she was



<P>very strongly persuaded; and though not meaning to be induced by him,



<P>or by any body else, to give up a situation which she believed more



<P>replete with good than any she could change it for, she had a great



<P>curiosity to see him, a decided intention of finding him pleasant,



<P>of being liked by him to a certain degree, and a sort of pleasure



<P>in the idea of their being coupled in their friends' imaginations.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With such sensations, Mr. Elton's civilities were dreadfully ill-timed;



<P>but she had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling



<P>very cross--and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not



<P>possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again,



<P>or the substance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.--So it proved;--



<P>for when happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston,



<P>at dinner, he made use of the very first interval in the cares



<P>of hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton,



<P>to say to her,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We want only two more to be just the right number.&nbsp; I should



<P>like to see two more here,--your pretty little friend, Miss Smith,



<P>and my son--and then I should say we were quite complete.



<P>I believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing-room



<P>that we are expecting Frank.&nbsp; I had a letter from him this morning,



<P>and he will be with us within a fortnight."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented



<P>to his proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making



<P>their party quite complete.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He has been wanting to come to us," continued Mr. Weston,



<P>"ever since September:&nbsp; every letter has been full of it;



<P>but he cannot command his own time.&nbsp; He has those to please



<P>who must be pleased, and who (between ourselves) are sometimes



<P>to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices.&nbsp; But now



<P>I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in January."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston



<P>is so anxious to be acquainted with him, that she must be almost



<P>as happy as yourself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, she would be, but that she thinks there will be another



<P>put-off. She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do:



<P>but she does not know the parties so well as I do.&nbsp; The case,



<P>you see, is--(but this is quite between ourselves:&nbsp; I did not mention



<P>a syllable of it in the other room.&nbsp; There are secrets in all families,



<P>you know)--The case is, that a party of friends are invited to pay



<P>a visit at Enscombe in January; and that Frank's coming depends upon



<P>their being put off.&nbsp; If they are not put off, he cannot stir.



<P>But I know they will, because it is a family that a certain lady,



<P>of some consequence, at Enscombe, has a particular dislike to:



<P>and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or



<P>three years, they always are put off when it comes to the point.



<P>I have not the smallest doubt of the issue.&nbsp; I am as confident



<P>of seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am



<P>of being here myself:&nbsp; but your good friend there (nodding



<P>towards the upper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself,



<P>and has been so little used to them at Hartfield, that she cannot



<P>calculate on their effects, as I have been long in the practice



<P>of doing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,"



<P>replied Emma; "but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston.&nbsp; If

you



<P>think he will come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes--I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been



<P>at the place in my life.--She is an odd woman!--But I never allow



<P>myself to speak ill of her, on Frank's account; for I do believe



<P>her to be very fond of him.&nbsp; I used to think she was not capable



<P>of being fond of any body, except herself:&nbsp; but she has always

been



<P>kind to him (in her way--allowing for little whims and caprices,



<P>and expecting every thing to be as she likes). And it is no small credit,



<P>in my opinion, to him, that he should excite such an affection;



<P>for, though I would not say it to any body else, she has no more



<P>heart than a stone to people in general; and the devil of a temper."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma liked the subject so well, that she began upon it, to Mrs. Weston,



<P>very soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her joy--



<P>yet observing, that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.--



<P>Mrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she should be very



<P>glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting



<P>at the time talked of:&nbsp; "for I cannot depend upon his coming.



<P>I cannot be so sanguine as Mr. Weston.&nbsp; I am very much afraid



<P>that it will all end in nothing.&nbsp; Mr. Weston, I dare say, has been



<P>telling you exactly how the matter stands?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes--it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour



<P>of Mrs. Churchill, which I imagine to be the most certain



<P>thing in the world."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My Emma!" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, "what is the certainty



<P>of caprice?"&nbsp; Then turning to Isabella, who had not been



<P>attending before--"You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley,



<P>that we are by no means so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill,



<P>in my opinion, as his father thinks.&nbsp; It depends entirely upon



<P>his aunt's spirits and pleasure; in short, upon her temper.



<P>To you--to my two daughters--I may venture on the truth.



<P>Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered woman;



<P>and his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,"



<P>replied Isabella:&nbsp; "and I am sure I never think of that poor young



<P>man without the greatest compassion.&nbsp; To be constantly living



<P>with an ill-tempered person, must be dreadful.&nbsp; It is what we



<P>happily have never known any thing of; but it must be a life



<P>of misery.&nbsp; What a blessing, that she never had any children!



<P>Poor little creatures, how unhappy she would have made them!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston.&nbsp; She should then

have



<P>heard more:&nbsp; Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve



<P>which she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really believed,



<P>would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills



<P>from her, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own



<P>imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge.



<P>But at present there was nothing more to be said.&nbsp; Mr. Woodhouse



<P>very soon followed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting



<P>long after dinner, was a confinement that he could not endure.



<P>Neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him; and gladly did



<P>he move to those with whom he was always comfortable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity



<P>of saying,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any



<P>means certain.&nbsp; I am sorry for it.&nbsp; The introduction must

be unpleasant,



<P>whenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays.



<P>Even if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still



<P>afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us.



<P>I cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side; but I am sure



<P>there is a great wish on the Churchills' to keep him to themselves.



<P>There is jealousy.&nbsp; They are jealous even of his regard for his

father.



<P>In short, I can feel no dependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston



<P>were less sanguine."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He ought to come," said Emma.&nbsp; "If he could stay only a couple



<P>of days, he ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man's



<P>not having it in his power to do as much as that.&nbsp; A young woman,



<P>if she fall into bad hands, may be teazed, and kept at a distance



<P>from those she wants to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young



<P>man's being under such restraint, as not to be able to spend a week



<P>with his father, if he likes it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family,



<P>before one decides upon what he can do," replied Mrs. Weston.



<P>"One ought to use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the



<P>conduct of any one individual of any one family; but Enscombe,



<P>I believe, certainly must not be judged by general rules:



<P>she is so very unreasonable; and every thing gives way to her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But she is so fond of the nephew:&nbsp; he is so very great a favourite.



<P>Now, according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural,



<P>that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband,



<P>to whom she owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice



<P>towards him, she should frequently be governed by the nephew,



<P>to whom she owes nothing at all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper,



<P>to understand a bad one, or to lay down rules for it:&nbsp; you must



<P>let it go its own way.&nbsp; I have no doubt of his having, at times,



<P>considerable influence; but it may be perfectly impossible for him



<P>to know beforehand when it will be."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma listened, and then coolly said, "I shall not be satisfied,



<P>unless he comes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He may have a great deal of influence on some points,"



<P>continued Mrs. Weston, "and on others, very little:&nbsp; and among

those,



<P>on which she is beyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be



<P>this very circumstance of his coming away from them to visit us."

<B>CHAPTER IV</B>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Harriet Smith's intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing.



<P>Quick and decided in her ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging,



<P>and telling her to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased,



<P>so did their satisfaction in each other.&nbsp; As a walking companion,



<P>Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her.



<P>In that respect Mrs. Weston's loss had been important.&nbsp; Her father



<P>never went beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground



<P>sufficed him for his long walk, or his short, as the year varied;



<P>and since Mrs. Weston's marriage her exercise had been too much confined.



<P>She had ventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not pleasant;



<P>and a Harriet Smith, therefore, one whom she could summon at any



<P>time to a walk, would be a valuable addition to her privileges.



<P>But in every respect, as she saw more of her, she approved her,



<P>and was confirmed in all her kind designs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile,



<P>grateful disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring



<P>to be guided by any one she looked up to.&nbsp; Her early attachment



<P>to herself was very amiable; and her inclination for good company,



<P>and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that



<P>there was no want of taste, though strength of understanding must



<P>not be expected.&nbsp; Altogether she was quite convinced of Harriet



<P>Smith's being exactly the young friend she wanted--exactly the



<P>something which her home required.&nbsp; Such a friend as Mrs. Weston



<P>was out of the question.&nbsp; Two such could never be granted.



<P>Two such she did not want.&nbsp; It was quite a different sort of thing,



<P>a sentiment distinct and independent.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston was the object



<P>of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem.



<P>Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful.



<P>For Mrs. Weston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who



<P>were the parents, but Harriet could not tell.&nbsp; She was ready to

tell



<P>every thing in her power, but on this subject questions were vain.



<P>Emma was obliged to fancy what she liked--but she could never



<P>believe that in the same situation she should not have discovered



<P>the truth.&nbsp; Harriet had no penetration.&nbsp; She had been satisfied



<P>to hear and believe just what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her;



<P>and looked no farther.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of the



<P>school in general, formed naturally a great part of the conversation--and



<P>but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey-Mill Farm,



<P>it must have been the whole.&nbsp; But the Martins occupied her thoughts



<P>a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with them,



<P>and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe



<P>the many comforts and wonders of the place.&nbsp; Emma encouraged her



<P>talkativeness-- amused by such a picture of another set of beings,



<P>and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much



<P>exultation of Mrs. Martin's having "two parlours, two very good parlours,



<P>indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard's drawing-room;



<P>and of her having an upper maid who had lived five-and-twenty years



<P>with her; and of their having eight cows, two of them Alderneys,



<P>and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch cow indeed;



<P>and of Mrs. Martin's saying as she was so fond of it, it should be



<P>called her cow; and of their having a very handsome summer-house



<P>in their garden, where some day next year they were all to drink



<P>tea:-- a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen people."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate

cause;



<P>but as she came to understand the family better, other feelings arose.



<P>She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and daughter,



<P>a son and son's wife, who all lived together; but when it appeared



<P>that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was always



<P>mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing something



<P>or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs. Martin,



<P>no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little



<P>friend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she



<P>were not taken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With this inspiriting notion, her questions increased in number



<P>and meaning; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin,



<P>and there was evidently no dislike to it.&nbsp; Harriet was very ready



<P>to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry



<P>evening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good-humoured



<P>and obliging.&nbsp; He had gone three miles round one day in order to

bring



<P>her some walnuts, because she had said how fond she was of them,



<P>and in every thing else he was so very obliging.&nbsp; He had his



<P>shepherd's son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her.



<P>She was very fond of singing.&nbsp; He could sing a little himself.



<P>She believed he was very clever, and understood every thing.



<P>He had a very fine flock, and, while she was with them,



<P>he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country.



<P>She believed every body spoke well of him.&nbsp; His mother and sisters



<P>were very fond of him.&nbsp; Mrs. Martin had told her one day (and there



<P>was a blush as she said it,) that it was impossible for any body



<P>to be a better son, and therefore she was sure, whenever he married,



<P>he would make a good husband.&nbsp; Not that she wanted him to marry.



<P>She was in no hurry at all.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well done, Mrs. Martin!" thought Emma.&nbsp; "You know what you are

about."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send



<P>Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose--the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had



<P>ever seen.&nbsp; Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked

all



<P>the three teachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson,



<P>to sup with her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line



<P>of his own business? He does not read?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh yes!--that is, no--I do not know--but I believe he has



<P>read a good deal--but not what you would think any thing of.



<P>He reads the Agricultural Reports, and some other books that lay



<P>in one of the window seats--but he reads all them to himself.



<P>But sometimes of an evening, before we went to cards, he would read



<P>something aloud out of the Elegant Extracts, very entertaining.



<P>And I know he has read the Vicar of Wakefield.&nbsp; He never read the



<P>Romance of the Forest, nor The Children of the Abbey.&nbsp; He had never



<P>heard of such books before I mentioned them, but he is determined



<P>to get them now as soon as ever he can."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The next question was--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! not handsome--not at all handsome.&nbsp; I thought him very plain



<P>at first, but I do not think him so plain now.&nbsp; One does not, you

know,



<P>after a time.&nbsp; But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every



<P>now and then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way



<P>to Kingston.&nbsp; He has passed you very often."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without



<P>having any idea of his name.&nbsp; A young farmer, whether on horseback



<P>or on foot, is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity.



<P>The yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel I



<P>can have nothing to do.&nbsp; A degree or two lower, and a creditable



<P>appearance might interest me; I might hope to be useful to their



<P>families in some way or other.&nbsp; But a farmer can need none of my

help,



<P>and is, therefore, in one sense, as much above my notice as in every



<P>other he is below it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To be sure.&nbsp; Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have



<P>observed him; but he knows you very well indeed--I mean by sight."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man.



<P>I know, indeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well.



<P>What do you imagine his age to be?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is



<P>the 23rd just a fortnight and a day's difference--which is very odd."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle.&nbsp; His mother

is



<P>perfectly right not to be in a hurry.&nbsp; They seem very comfortable



<P>as they are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him,



<P>she would probably repent it.&nbsp; Six years hence, if he could meet



<P>with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own,



<P>with a little money, it might be very desirable."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry,



<P>who are not born to an independence.&nbsp; Mr. Martin, I imagine,



<P>has his fortune entirely to make--cannot be at all beforehand with



<P>the world.&nbsp; Whatever money he might come into when his father died,



<P>whatever his share of the family property, it is, I dare say,



<P>all afloat, all employed in his stock, and so forth; and though,



<P>with diligence and good luck, he may be rich in time, it is next to



<P>impossible that he should have realised any thing yet."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To be sure, so it is.&nbsp; But they live very comfortably.



<P>They have no indoors man, else they do not want for any thing;



<P>and Mrs. Martin talks of taking a boy another year."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does



<P>marry;--I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife--for though



<P>his sisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether



<P>objected to, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all

fit



<P>for you to notice.&nbsp; The misfortune of your birth ought to make

you



<P>particularly careful as to your associates.&nbsp; There can be no doubt



<P>of your being a gentleman's daughter, and you must support your



<P>claim to that station by every thing within your own power, or there



<P>will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are.&nbsp; But while I visit



<P>at Hartfield, and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse,



<P>I am not afraid of what any body can do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I



<P>would have you so firmly established in good society, as to be



<P>independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse.&nbsp; I want to see

you



<P>permanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable



<P>to have as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say



<P>that if you should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries,



<P>I wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters,



<P>to be acquainted with the wife, who will probably be some mere



<P>farmer's daughter, without education."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To be sure.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever

marry any body



<P>but what had had some education--and been very well brought up.



<P>However, I do not mean to set up my opinion against your's--and I



<P>am sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his wife.&nbsp; I shall



<P>always have a great regard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth,



<P>and should be very sorry to give them up, for they are quite as well



<P>educated as me.&nbsp; But if he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman,



<P>certainly I had better not visit her, if I can help it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech,



<P>and saw no alarming symptoms of love.&nbsp; The young man had been



<P>the first admirer, but she trusted there was no other hold,



<P>and that there would be no serious difficulty, on Harriet's side,



<P>to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the



<P>Donwell road.&nbsp; He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully



<P>at her, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion.



<P>Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey;



<P>and walking a few yards forward, while they talked together, soon made



<P>her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin.



<P>His appearance was very neat, and he looked like a sensible young man,



<P>but his person had no other advantage; and when he came to be



<P>contrasted with gentlemen, she thought he must lose all the ground



<P>he had gained in Harriet's inclination.&nbsp; Harriet was not insensible



<P>of manner; she had voluntarily noticed her father's gentleness



<P>with admiration as well as wonder.&nbsp; Mr. Martin looked as if he



<P>did not know what manner was.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must



<P>not be kept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a



<P>smiling face, and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse



<P>hoped very soon to compose.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Only think of our happening to meet him!--How very odd! It was



<P>quite a chance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls.



<P>He did not think we ever walked this road.&nbsp; He thought we walked



<P>towards Randalls most days.&nbsp; He has not been able to get the



<P>Romance of the Forest yet.&nbsp; He was so busy the last time he was



<P>at Kingston that he quite forgot it, but he goes again to-morrow.



<P>So very odd we should happen to meet! Well, Miss Woodhouse, is he



<P>like what you expected? What do you think of him? Do you think him



<P>so very plain?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He is very plain, undoubtedly--remarkably plain:--but that is



<P>nothing compared with his entire want of gentility.&nbsp; I had no



<P>right to expect much, and I did not expect much; but I had no



<P>idea that he could be so very clownish, so totally without air.



<P>I had imagined him, I confess, a degree or two nearer gentility."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To be sure," said Harriet, in a mortified voice, "he is not



<P>so genteel as real gentlemen."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been



<P>repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen,



<P>that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin.



<P>At Hartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated,



<P>well bred men.&nbsp; I should be surprized if, after seeing them,



<P>you could be in company with Mr. Martin again without perceiving



<P>him to be a very inferior creature--and rather wondering at



<P>yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before.



<P>Do not you begin to feel that now? Were not you struck? I am sure



<P>you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner,



<P>and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated



<P>as I stood here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley.&nbsp; He has not such a fine



<P>air and way of walking as Mr. Knightley.&nbsp; I see the difference



<P>plain enough.&nbsp; But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr. Knightley's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair



<P>to compare Mr. Martin with him.&nbsp; You might not see one in a hundred



<P>with gentleman so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley.&nbsp; But he

is



<P>not the only gentleman you have been lately used to.&nbsp; What say

you



<P>to Mr. Weston and Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of them.



<P>Compare their manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking;



<P>of being silent.&nbsp; You must see the difference."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh yes!--there is a great difference.&nbsp; But Mr. Weston is almost



<P>an old man.&nbsp; Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Which makes his good manners the more valuable.&nbsp; The older a



<P>person grows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners



<P>should not be bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness,



<P>or coarseness, or awkwardness becomes.&nbsp; What is passable in youth



<P>is detestable in later age.&nbsp; Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt;



<P>what will he be at Mr. Weston's time of life?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is no saying, indeed," replied Harriet rather solemnly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But there may be pretty good guessing.&nbsp; He will be a completely

gross,



<P>vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking



<P>of nothing but profit and loss."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Will he, indeed? That will be very bad."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the



<P>circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended.



<P>He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing



<P>else--which is just as it should be, for a thriving man.&nbsp; What

has



<P>he to do with books? And I have no doubt that he will thrive,



<P>and be a very rich man in time--and his being illiterate and coarse



<P>need not disturb us."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wonder he did not remember the book"--was all Harriet's answer,



<P>and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might



<P>be safely left to itself.&nbsp; She, therefore, said no more for some

time.



<P>Her next beginning was,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton's manners are superior



<P>to Mr. Knightley's or Mr. Weston's. They have more gentleness.



<P>They might be more safely held up as a pattern.&nbsp; There is an openness,



<P>a quickness, almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body



<P>likes in him, because there is so much good-humour with it--but



<P>that would not do to be copied.&nbsp; Neither would Mr. Knightley's



<P>downright, decided, commanding sort of manner, though it suits



<P>him very well; his figure, and look, and situation in life seem



<P>to allow it; but if any young man were to set about copying him,



<P>he would not be sufferable.&nbsp; On the contrary, I think a young man



<P>might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model.



<P>Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle.



<P>He seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late.&nbsp; I do not



<P>know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either



<P>of us, Harriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his



<P>manners are softer than they used to be.&nbsp; If he means any thing,



<P>it must be to please you.&nbsp; Did not I tell you what he said of you



<P>the other day?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn



<P>from Mr. Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed



<P>and smiled, and said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving



<P>the young farmer out of Harriet's head.&nbsp; She thought it would



<P>be an excellent match; and only too palpably desirable, natural,



<P>and probable, for her to have much merit in planning it.



<P>She feared it was what every body else must think of and predict.



<P>It was not likely, however, that any body should have equalled



<P>her in the date of the plan, as it had entered her brain during



<P>the very first evening of Harriet's coming to Hartfield.&nbsp; The longer



<P>she considered it, the greater was her sense of its expediency.



<P>Mr. Elton's situation was most suitable, quite the gentleman himself,



<P>and without low connexions; at the same time, not of any family



<P>that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.&nbsp; He

had a



<P>comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient income;



<P>for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was known



<P>to have some independent property; and she thought very highly



<P>of him as a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man,



<P>without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful



<P>girl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield,



<P>was foundation enough on his side; and on Harriet's there could be



<P>little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all



<P>the usual weight and efficacy.&nbsp; And he was really a very pleasing



<P>young man, a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like.



<P>He was reckoned very handsome; his person much admired in general,



<P>though not by her, there being a want of elegance of feature which



<P>she could not dispense with:--but the girl who could be gratified



<P>by a Robert Martin's riding about the country to get walnuts



<P>for her might very well be conquered by Mr. Elton's admiration.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Though now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather



<P>to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise;



<P>and on the morrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor



<P>sick family, who lived a little way out of Highbury.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane



<P>leading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street



<P>of the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode



<P>of Mr. Elton.&nbsp; A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed,



<P>and then, about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage,



<P>an old and not very good house, almost as close to the road as it



<P>could be.&nbsp; It had no advantage of situation; but had been very

much



<P>smartened up by the present proprietor; and, such as it was,



<P>there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without



<P>a slackened pace and observing eyes.--Emma's remark was--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There it is.&nbsp; There go you and your riddle-book one of these days."--



<P>Harriet's was--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, what a sweet house!--How very beautiful!--There are the yellow



<P>curtains that Miss Nash admires so much."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not often walk this way now," said Emma, as they proceeded,



<P>"but then there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get



<P>intimately acquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards



<P>of this part of Highbury."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet, she found, had never in her life been within side the Vicarage,



<P>and her curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors



<P>and probabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love,



<P>with Mr. Elton's seeing ready wit in her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I wish we could contrive it," said she; "but I cannot think



<P>of any tolerable pretence for going in;--no servant that I want



<P>to inquire about of his housekeeper--no message from my father."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She pondered, but could think of nothing.&nbsp; After a mutual silence



<P>of some minutes, Harriet thus began again--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married,



<P>or going to be married! so charming as you are!"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma laughed, and replied,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry;



<P>I must find other people charming--one other person at least.



<P>And I am not only, not going to be married, at present, but have



<P>very little intention of ever marrying at all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah!--so you say; but I cannot believe it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet,



<P>to be tempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,)



<P>is out of the question:&nbsp; and I do not wish to see any such person.



<P>I would rather not be tempted.&nbsp; I cannot really change for the

better.



<P>If I were to marry, I must expect to repent it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dear me!--it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry.



<P>Were I to fall in love, indeed, it would be a different thing!



<P>but I never have been in love; it is not my way, or my nature;



<P>and I do not think I ever shall.&nbsp; And, without love, I am sure

I



<P>should be a fool to change such a situation as mine.&nbsp; Fortune I



<P>do not want; employment I do not want; consequence I do not want:



<P>I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their



<P>husband's house as I am of Hartfield; and never, never could I expect



<P>to be so truly beloved and important; so always first and always



<P>right in any man's eyes as I am in my father's."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if

I



<P>thought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly--so satisfied--



<P>so smiling--so prosing--so undistinguishing and unfastidious--



<P>and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me,



<P>I would marry to-morrow. But between us, I am convinced there never



<P>can be any likeness, except in being unmarried."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But still, you will be an old maid! and that's so dreadful!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is



<P>poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public!



<P>A single woman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous,



<P>disagreeable old maid! the proper sport of boys and girls,



<P>but a single woman, of good fortune, is always respectable,



<P>and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else.&nbsp; And the



<P>distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common



<P>sense of the world as appears at first; for a very narrow income



<P>has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour the temper.



<P>Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very small,



<P>and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and cross.



<P>This does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too good



<P>natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very



<P>much to the taste of every body, though single and though poor.



<P>Poverty certainly has not contracted her mind:&nbsp; I really believe,



<P>if she had only a shilling in the world, she would be very likely



<P>to give away sixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her:&nbsp; that

is a



<P>great charm."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself



<P>when you grow old?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great



<P>many independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be



<P>more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty.



<P>Woman's usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then



<P>as they are now; or with no important variation.&nbsp; If I draw less,



<P>I shall read more; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work.



<P>And as for objects of interest, objects for the affections,



<P>which is in truth the great point of inferiority, the want of which



<P>is really the great evil to be avoided in not marrying, I shall



<P>be very well off, with all the children of a sister I love so much,



<P>to care about.&nbsp; There will be enough of them, in all probability,



<P>to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need.



<P>There will be enough for every hope and every fear; and though my



<P>attachment to none can equal that of a parent, it suits my ideas



<P>of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder.&nbsp; My nephews



<P>and nieces!--I shall often have a niece with me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you know Miss Bates's niece?&nbsp; That is, I know you must have



<P>seen her a hundred times--but are you acquainted?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes



<P>to Highbury.&nbsp; By the bye, that is almost enough to put one out



<P>of conceit with a niece.&nbsp; Heaven forbid! at least, that I should



<P>ever bore people half so much about all the Knightleys together,



<P>as she does about Jane Fairfax.&nbsp; One is sick of the very name



<P>of Jane Fairfax.&nbsp; Every letter from her is read forty times over;



<P>her compliments to all friends go round and round again; and if she



<P>does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher, or knit a pair



<P>of garters for her grandmother, one hears of nothing else for a month.



<P>I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she tires me to death."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics



<P>were superseded.&nbsp; Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses



<P>of the poor were as sure of relief from her personal attention



<P>and kindness, her counsel and her patience, as from her purse.



<P>She understood their ways, could allow for their ignorance and



<P>their temptations, had no romantic expectations of extraordinary



<P>virtue from those for whom education had done so little; entered into



<P>their troubles with ready sympathy, and always gave her assistance



<P>with as much intelligence as good-will.&nbsp; In the present instance,



<P>it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit;



<P>and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice,



<P>she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene



<P>as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good.&nbsp; How trifling they



<P>make every thing else appear!--I feel now as if I could think of



<P>nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet,



<P>who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very true," said Harriet.&nbsp; "Poor creatures! one can think



<P>of nothing else."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,"



<P>said Emma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep



<P>which ended the narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden,



<P>and brought them into the lane again.&nbsp; "I do not think it will,"



<P>stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place,



<P>and recall the still greater within.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! dear, no," said her companion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They walked on.&nbsp; The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend



<P>was passed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near



<P>as to give Emma time only to say farther,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah!&nbsp; Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability



<P>in good thoughts.&nbsp; Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that



<P>if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers,



<P>it has done all that is truly important.&nbsp; If we feel for the wretched,



<P>enough to do all we can for them, the rest is empty sympathy,



<P>only distressing to ourselves."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet could just answer, "Oh! dear, yes," before the gentleman



<P>joined them.&nbsp; The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however,



<P>were the first subject on meeting.&nbsp; He had been going to call



<P>on them.&nbsp; His visit he would now defer; but they had a very



<P>interesting parley about what could be done and should be done.



<P>Mr. Elton then turned back to accompany them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To fall in with each other on such an errand as this," thought Emma;



<P>"to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase



<P>of love on each side.&nbsp; I should not wonder if it were to bring



<P>on the declaration.&nbsp; It must, if I were not here.&nbsp; I wish

I were



<P>anywhere else."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon



<P>afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised



<P>on one side of the lane, leaving them together in the main road.



<P>But she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet's



<P>habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that,



<P>in short, they would both be soon after her.&nbsp; This would not do;



<P>she immediately stopped, under pretence of having some alteration



<P>to make in the lacing of her half-boot, and stooping down in complete



<P>occupation of the footpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk

on,



<P>and she would follow in half a minute.&nbsp; They did as they were desired;



<P>and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot,



<P>she had the comfort of farther delay in her power, being overtaken



<P>by a child from the cottage, setting out, according to orders,



<P>with her pitcher, to fetch broth from Hartfield.&nbsp; To walk by the

side



<P>of this child, and talk to and question her, was the most natural



<P>thing in the world, or would have been the most natural, had she been



<P>acting just then without design; and by this means the others were



<P>still able to keep ahead, without any obligation of waiting for her.



<P>She gained on them, however, involuntarily:&nbsp; the child's pace was

quick,



<P>and theirs rather slow; and she was the more concerned at it,



<P>from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them.



<P>Mr. Elton was speaking with animation, Harriet listening with a very



<P>pleased attention; and Emma, having sent the child on, was beginning



<P>to think how she might draw back a little more, when they both



<P>looked around, and she was obliged to join them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail;



<P>and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he



<P>was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday's



<P>party at his friend Cole's, and that she was come in herself for



<P>the Stilton cheese, the north Wiltshire, the butter, the cellery,



<P>the beet-root, and all the dessert.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This would soon have led to something better, of course," was her



<P>consoling reflection; "any thing interests between those who love;



<P>and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart.



<P>If I could but have kept longer away!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage



<P>pales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into



<P>the house, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot,



<P>and fall behind to arrange it once more.&nbsp; She then broke the lace



<P>off short, and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently



<P>obliged to entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to



<P>put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Part of my lace is gone," said she, "and I do not know how I am



<P>to contrive.&nbsp; I really am a most troublesome companion to you both,



<P>but I hope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg



<P>leave to stop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit



<P>of ribband or string, or any thing just to keep my boot on."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing



<P>could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into



<P>his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage.



<P>The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied,



<P>and looking forwards; behind it was another with which it immediately



<P>communicated; the door between them was open, and Emma passed



<P>into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most



<P>comfortable manner.&nbsp; She was obliged to leave the door ajar as

she



<P>found it; but she fully intended that Mr. Elton should close it.



<P>It was not closed, however, it still remained ajar; but by engaging



<P>the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she hoped to make it



<P>practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room.



<P>For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself.&nbsp; It could



<P>be protracted no longer.&nbsp; She was then obliged to be finished,



<P>and make her appearance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The lovers were standing together at one of the windows.&nbsp; It had

a



<P>most favourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory



<P>of having schemed successfully.&nbsp; But it would not do; he had not



<P>come to the point.&nbsp; He had been most agreeable, most delightful;



<P>he had told Harriet that he had seen them go by, and had purposely



<P>followed them; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt,



<P>but nothing serious.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Cautious, very cautious," thought Emma; "he advances inch by inch,



<P>and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Still, however, though every thing had not been accomplished



<P>by her ingenious device, she could not but flatter herself



<P>that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both,



<P>and must be leading them forward to the great event.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Mr. Elton must now be left to himself.&nbsp; It was no longer in Emma's



<P>power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures.



<P>The coming of her sister's family was so very near at hand,



<P>that first in anticipation, and then in reality, it became henceforth



<P>her prime object of interest; and during the ten days of their stay



<P>at Hartfield it was not to be expected--she did not herself expect--



<P>that any thing beyond occasional, fortuitous assistance could



<P>be afforded by her to the lovers.&nbsp; They might advance rapidly



<P>if they would, however; they must advance somehow or other whether



<P>they would or no.&nbsp; She hardly wished to have more leisure for them.



<P>There are people, who the more you do for them, the less they will



<P>do for themselves.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual



<P>absent from Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the



<P>usual interest.&nbsp; Till this year, every long vacation since their



<P>marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey;



<P>but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing



<P>for the children, and it was therefore many months since they had



<P>been seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions, or seen at all



<P>by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not be induced to get so far as London,



<P>even for poor Isabella's sake; and who consequently was now most



<P>nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He thought much of the evils of the journey for her, and not a



<P>little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to



<P>bring some of the party the last half of the way; but his alarms



<P>were needless; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished,



<P>and Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, their five children, and a competent



<P>number of nursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety.



<P>The bustle and joy of such an arrival, the many to be talked to,



<P>welcomed, encouraged, and variously dispersed and disposed of,



<P>produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne



<P>under any other cause, nor have endured much longer even for this;



<P>but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were



<P>so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that in spite of maternal



<P>solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones,



<P>and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance,



<P>all the eating and drinking, and sleeping and playing,



<P>which they could possibly wish for, without the smallest delay,



<P>the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him,



<P>either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle,



<P>quiet manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate;



<P>wrapt up in her family; a devoted wife, a doating mother,



<P>and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that, but for



<P>these higher ties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible.



<P>She could never see a fault in any of them.&nbsp; She was not a woman



<P>of strong understanding or any quickness; and with this resemblance



<P>of her father, she inherited also much of his constitution;



<P>was delicate in her own health, over-careful of that of her children,



<P>had many fears and many nerves, and was as fond of her own Mr. Wingfield



<P>in town as her father could be of Mr. Perry.&nbsp; They were alike too,



<P>in a general benevolence of temper, and a strong habit of regard



<P>for every old acquaintance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man;



<P>rising in his profession, domestic, and respectable in his



<P>private character; but with reserved manners which prevented his being



<P>generally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour.



<P>He was not an ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross



<P>as to deserve such a reproach; but his temper was not his



<P>great perfection; and, indeed, with such a worshipping wife,



<P>it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not



<P>be increased.&nbsp; The extreme sweetness of her temper must hurt his.



<P>He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted,



<P>and he could sometimes act an ungracious, or say a severe thing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was not a great favourite with his fair sister-in-law. Nothing



<P>wrong in him escaped her.&nbsp; She was quick in feeling the little



<P>injuries to Isabella, which Isabella never felt herself.



<P>Perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been



<P>flattering to Isabella's sister, but they were only those of a calmly



<P>kind brother and friend, without praise and without blindness;



<P>but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her



<P>regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes



<P>fell into, the want of respectful forbearance towards her father.



<P>There he had not always the patience that could have been wished.



<P>Mr. Woodhouse's peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking



<P>him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill-bestowed.



<P>It did not often happen; for Mr. John Knightley had really a great



<P>regard for his father-in-law, and generally a strong sense of what was



<P>due to him; but it was too often for Emma's charity, especially as



<P>there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured,



<P>though the offence came not.&nbsp; The beginning, however, of every

visit



<P>displayed none but the properest feelings, and this being of necessity



<P>so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality.



<P>They had not been long seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse,



<P>with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh, called his daughter's



<P>attention to the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, my dear," said he, "poor Miss Taylor--It is a grievous business."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh yes, sir," cried she with ready sympathy, "how you must



<P>miss her!&nbsp; And dear Emma, too!--What a dreadful loss to you both!--



<P>I have been so grieved for you.--I could not imagine how you could



<P>possibly do without her.--It is a sad change indeed.--But I hope



<P>she is pretty well, sir."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Pretty well, my dear--I hope--pretty well.--I do not know



<P>but that the place agrees with her tolerably."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any



<P>doubts of the air of Randalls.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! no--none in the least.&nbsp; I never saw Mrs. Weston better in

my life--



<P>never looking so well.&nbsp; Papa is only speaking his own regret."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very much to the honour of both," was the handsome reply.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And do you see her, sir, tolerably often?" asked Isabella



<P>in the plaintive tone which just suited her father.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.--"Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since



<P>they married.&nbsp; Either in the morning or evening of every day,



<P>excepting one, have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston,



<P>and generally both, either at Randalls or here--and as you



<P>may suppose, Isabella, most frequently here.&nbsp; They are very,



<P>very kind in their visits.&nbsp; Mr. Weston is really as kind as herself.



<P>Papa, if you speak in that melancholy way, you will be giving



<P>Isabella a false idea of us all.&nbsp; Every body must be aware that

Miss



<P>Taylor must be missed, but every body ought also to be assured



<P>that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her by any



<P>means to the extent we ourselves anticipated--which is the exact truth."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Just as it should be," said Mr. John Knightley, "and just as I hoped



<P>it was from your letters.&nbsp; Her wish of shewing you attention could



<P>not be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it



<P>all easy.&nbsp; I have been always telling you, my love, that I had

no idea



<P>of the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended;



<P>and now you have Emma's account, I hope you will be satisfied."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, to be sure," said Mr. Woodhouse--"yes, certainly--I cannot deny



<P>that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty often--



<P>but then--she is always obliged to go away again."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.--



<P>You quite forget poor Mr. Weston."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think, indeed," said John Knightley pleasantly, "that Mr. Weston



<P>has some little claim.&nbsp; You and I, Emma, will venture to take the

part



<P>of the poor husband.&nbsp; I, being a husband, and you not being a wife,



<P>the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force.



<P>As for Isabella, she has been married long enough to see the convenience



<P>of putting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Me, my love," cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part.--



<P>"Are you talking about me?--I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be,



<P>a greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been



<P>for the misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought



<P>of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world;



<P>and as to slighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think



<P>there is nothing he does not deserve.&nbsp; I believe he is one of the



<P>very best-tempered men that ever existed.&nbsp; Excepting yourself



<P>and your brother, I do not know his equal for temper.&nbsp; I shall



<P>never forget his flying Henry's kite for him that very windy day



<P>last Easter--and ever since his particular kindness last September



<P>twelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o'clock at night,



<P>on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham,



<P>I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor



<P>a better man in existence.--If any body can deserve him, it must be



<P>Miss Taylor."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Where is the young man?" said John Knightley.&nbsp; "Has he been here



<P>on this occasion--or has he not?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He has not been here yet," replied Emma.&nbsp; "There was a strong



<P>expectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended



<P>in nothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But you should tell them of the letter, my dear," said her father.



<P>"He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her,



<P>and a very proper, handsome letter it was.&nbsp; She shewed it to me.



<P>I thought it very well done of him indeed.&nbsp; Whether it was his

own idea



<P>you know, one cannot tell.&nbsp; He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Three-and-twenty!--is he indeed?--Well, I could not have thought it--



<P>and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother!&nbsp; Well,



<P>time does fly indeed!--and my memory is very bad.&nbsp; However, it

was



<P>an exceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston



<P>a great deal of pleasure.&nbsp; I remember it was written from Weymouth,



<P>and dated Sept. 28th--and began, `My dear Madam,' but I forget



<P>how it went on; and it was signed `F. C. Weston Churchill.'--



<P>I remember that perfectly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How very pleasing and proper of him!" cried the good-hearted Mrs. John



<P>Knightley.&nbsp; "I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young

man.



<P>But how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father!



<P>There is something so shocking in a child's being taken away from his



<P>parents and natural home!&nbsp; I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston



<P>could part with him.&nbsp; To give up one's child!&nbsp; I really never



<P>could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,"



<P>observed Mr. John Knightley coolly.&nbsp; "But you need not imagine



<P>Mr. Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry



<P>or John.&nbsp; Mr. Weston is rather an easy, cheerful-tempered man,



<P>than a man of strong feelings; he takes things as he finds them,



<P>and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other, depending, I suspect,



<P>much more upon what is called society for his comforts, that is,



<P>upon the power of eating and drinking, and playing whist with his



<P>neighbours five times a week, than upon family affection, or any



<P>thing that home affords."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston,



<P>and had half a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let



<P>it pass.&nbsp; She would keep the peace if possible; and there was



<P>something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits,



<P>the all-sufficiency of home to himself, whence resulted her brother's



<P>disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse,



<P>and those to whom it was important.--It had a high claim to forbearance.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>"I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston," said Mr. Knightley,

"of



<P>this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but I think it a

bad thing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?-- why so?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I think they will neither of them do the other any good."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her



<P>with a new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good.



<P>I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure.



<P>How very differently we feel!--Not think they will do each other any



<P>good! This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels



<P>about Emma, Mr. Knightley."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you,



<P>knowing Weston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here,



<P>for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject.&nbsp; We were speaking



<P>of it only yesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma,



<P>that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with.



<P>Mr. Knightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case.



<P>You are so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value



<P>of a companion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort



<P>a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex, after being used



<P>to it all her life.&nbsp; I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith.



<P>She is not the superior young woman which Emma's friend ought to be.



<P>But on the other hand, as Emma wants to see her better informed,



<P>it will be an inducement to her to read more herself.&nbsp; They will



<P>read together.&nbsp; She means it, I know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve



<P>years old.&nbsp; I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at



<P>various times of books that she meant to read regularly through--and



<P>very good lists they were--very well chosen, and very neatly



<P>arranged--sometimes alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule.



<P>The list she drew up when only fourteen--I remember thinking it



<P>did her judgment so much credit, that I preserved it some time;



<P>and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now.&nbsp; But

I



<P>have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma.



<P>She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience,



<P>and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding.&nbsp; Where Miss

Taylor



<P>failed to stimulate, I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do



<P>nothing.-- You never could persuade her to read half so much as you



<P>wished.--You know you could not."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I dare say," replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, "that I thought



<P>so then;--but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma's



<P>omitting to do any thing I wished."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as that,"--said



<P>Mr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done.&nbsp;

"But I,"



<P>he soon added, "who have had no such charm thrown over my senses,



<P>must still see, hear, and remember.&nbsp; Emma is spoiled by being the



<P>cleverest of her family.&nbsp; At ten years old, she had the misfortune

of



<P>being able to answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen.



<P>She was always quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident.



<P>And ever since she was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house



<P>and of you all.&nbsp; In her mother she lost the only person able to

cope



<P>with her.&nbsp; She inherits her mother's talents, and must have been



<P>under subjection to her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on



<P>your recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse's family and wanted



<P>another situation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word

for



<P>me to any body.&nbsp; I am sure you always thought me unfit for the

office I held."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," said he, smiling.&nbsp; "You are better placed here; very fit



<P>for a wife, but not at all for a governess.&nbsp; But you were preparing



<P>yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield.



<P>You might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would



<P>seem to promise; but you were receiving a very good education from her,



<P>on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will,



<P>and doing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend



<P>him a wife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you.&nbsp; There will be very little merit in making a good wife



<P>to such a man as Mr. Weston."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away,



<P>and that with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing



<P>to be borne.&nbsp; We will not despair, however.&nbsp; Weston may grow

cross



<P>from the wantonness of comfort, or his son may plague him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hope not that.--It is not likely.&nbsp; No, Mr. Knightley, do not



<P>foretell vexation from that quarter."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not I, indeed.&nbsp; I only name possibilities.&nbsp; I do not pretend

to Emma's



<P>genius for foretelling and guessing.&nbsp; I hope, with all my heart,



<P>the young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.--But



<P>Harriet Smith--I have not half done about Harriet Smith.&nbsp; I think



<P>her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have.



<P>She knows nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing.



<P>She is a flatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse,



<P>because undesigned.&nbsp; Her ignorance is hourly flattery.&nbsp; How

can



<P>Emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself, while Harriet



<P>is presenting such a delightful inferiority? And as for Harriet,



<P>I will venture to say that she cannot gain by the acquaintance.



<P>Hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places



<P>she belongs to.&nbsp; She will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable



<P>with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home.



<P>I am much mistaken if Emma's doctrines give any strength of mind,



<P>or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties



<P>of her situation in life.--They only give a little polish."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I either depend more upon Emma's good sense than you do, or am more



<P>anxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance.



<P>How well she looked last night!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you?



<P>Very well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma's being pretty."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Pretty! say beautiful rather.&nbsp; Can you imagine any thing nearer



<P>perfect beauty than Emma altogether-- face and figure?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have



<P>seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers.



<P>But I am a partial old friend."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Such an eye!--the true hazle eye--and so brilliant! regular features,



<P>open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health,



<P>and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!



<P>There is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head,



<P>her glance.&nbsp; One hears sometimes of a child being `the picture



<P>of health;' now, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete



<P>picture of grown-up health.&nbsp; She is loveliness itself.&nbsp; Mr.

Knightley,



<P>is not she?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have not a fault to find with her person," he replied.



<P>"I think her all you describe.&nbsp; I love to look at her; and I



<P>will add this praise, that I do not think her personally vain.



<P>Considering how very handsome she is, she appears to be little



<P>occupied with it; her vanity lies another way.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston, I

am



<P>not to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith, or my dread



<P>of its doing them both harm."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its



<P>not doing them any harm.&nbsp; With all dear Emma's little faults,



<P>she is an excellent creature.&nbsp; Where shall we see a better daughter,



<P>or a kinder sister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities



<P>which may be trusted; she will never lead any one really wrong;



<P>she will make no lasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the



<P>right a hundred times."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very well; I will not plague you any more.&nbsp; Emma shall be an angel,



<P>and I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John



<P>and Isabella.&nbsp; John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore



<P>not a blind affection, and Isabella always thinks as he does;



<P>except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children.



<P>I am sure of having their opinions with me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind;



<P>but excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself,



<P>you know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma's



<P>mother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think



<P>any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith's intimacy being made



<P>a matter of much discussion among you.&nbsp; Pray excuse me; but supposing



<P>any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy,



<P>it cannot be expected that Emma, accountable to nobody but her father,



<P>who perfectly approves the acquaintance, should put an end to it,



<P>so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself.&nbsp; It has been

so



<P>many years my province to give advice, that you cannot be surprized,



<P>Mr. Knightley, at this little remains of office."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not at all," cried he; "I am much obliged to you for it.



<P>It is very good advice, and it shall have a better fate than your



<P>advice has often found; for it shall be attended to."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy



<P>about her sister."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Be satisfied," said he, "I will not raise any outcry.&nbsp; I will

keep



<P>my ill-humour to myself.&nbsp; I have a very sincere interest in Emma.



<P>Isabella does not seem more my sister; has never excited a



<P>greater interest; perhaps hardly so great.&nbsp; There is an anxiety,



<P>a curiosity in what one feels for Emma.&nbsp; I wonder what will become



<P>of her!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So do I," said Mrs. Weston gently, "very much."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She always declares she will never marry, which, of course,



<P>means just nothing at all.&nbsp; But I have no idea that she has yet



<P>ever seen a man she cared for.&nbsp; It would not be a bad thing for

her



<P>to be very much in love with a proper object.&nbsp; I should like to

see



<P>Emma in love, and in some doubt of a return; it would do her good.



<P>But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her; and she goes so seldom



<P>from home."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break



<P>her resolution at present," said Mrs. Weston, "as can well be;



<P>and while she is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be



<P>forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties



<P>on poor Mr. Woodhouse's account.&nbsp; I do not recommend matrimony



<P>at present to Emma, though I mean no slight to the state, I assure you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of



<P>her own and Mr. Weston's on the subject, as much as possible.



<P>There were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma's destiny, but it



<P>was not desirable to have them suspected; and the quiet transition



<P>which Mr. Knightley soon afterwards made to "What does Weston



<P>think of the weather; shall we have rain?" convinced her that he



<P>had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield.

<B>CHAPTER XIII</B>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John



<P>Knightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning



<P>among her old acquaintance with her five children, and talking



<P>over what she had done every evening with her father and sister.



<P>She had nothing to wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass



<P>so swiftly.&nbsp; It was a delightful visit;--perfect, in being much

too short.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than



<P>their mornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out



<P>of the house too, there was no avoiding, though at Christmas.



<P>Mr. Weston would take no denial; they must all dine at Randalls



<P>one day;--even Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible



<P>thing in preference to a division of the party.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>How they were all to be conveyed, he would have made a difficulty



<P>if he could, but as his son and daughter's carriage and horses



<P>were actually at Hartfield, he was not able to make more than



<P>a simple question on that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt;



<P>nor did it occupy Emma long to convince him that they might in one



<P>of the carriages find room for Harriet also.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set,



<P>were the only persons invited to meet them;--the hours were to be early,



<P>as well as the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse's habits and inclination



<P>being consulted in every thing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The evening before this great event (for it was a very great event



<P>that Mr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been



<P>spent by Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed



<P>with a cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed



<P>by Mrs. Goddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house.



<P>Emma called on her the next day, and found her doom already signed



<P>with regard to Randalls.&nbsp; She was very feverish and had a bad



<P>sore throat:&nbsp; Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection, Mr.

Perry



<P>was talked of, and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist



<P>the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement,



<P>though she could not speak of her loss without many tears.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs. Goddard's



<P>unavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing how much



<P>Mr. Elton's would be depressed when he knew her state; and left her



<P>at last tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his having



<P>a most comfortless visit, and of their all missing her very much.



<P>She had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard's door, when she



<P>was met by Mr. Elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as



<P>they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid--



<P>of whom he, on the rumour of considerable illness, had been going



<P>to inquire, that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield--



<P>they were overtaken by Mr. John Knightley returning from the



<P>daily visit to Donwell, with his two eldest boys, whose healthy,



<P>glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run, and seemed



<P>to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they



<P>were hastening home for.&nbsp; They joined company and proceeded together.



<P>Emma was just describing the nature of her friend's complaint;--



<P>"a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat about her,



<P>a quick, low pulse, &amp;c.&nbsp; and she was sorry to find from Mrs.

Goddard



<P>that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often



<P>alarmed her with them."&nbsp; Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion,



<P>as he exclaimed,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A sore-throat!--I hope not infectious.&nbsp; I hope not of a putrid



<P>infectious sort.&nbsp; Has Perry seen her?&nbsp; Indeed you should take

care



<P>of yourself as well as of your friend.&nbsp; Let me entreat you to run



<P>no risks.&nbsp; Why does not Perry see her?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this



<P>excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard's experience



<P>and care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness



<P>which she could not wish to reason away, which she would rather



<P>feed and assist than not, she added soon afterwards--as if quite



<P>another subject,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is so cold, so very cold--and looks and feels so very much



<P>like snow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party,



<P>I should really try not to go out to-day--and dissuade my father



<P>from venturing; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem



<P>to feel the cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it



<P>would be so great a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston.&nbsp; But,

upon



<P>my word, Mr. Elton, in your case, I should certainly excuse myself.



<P>You appear to me a little hoarse already, and when you consider



<P>what demand of voice and what fatigues to-morrow will bring,



<P>I think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home



<P>and take care of yourself to-night."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make;



<P>which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind



<P>care of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of



<P>her's, he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;--



<P>but Emma, too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions



<P>and views to hear him impartially, or see him with clear vision,



<P>was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its



<P>being "very cold, certainly very cold," and walked on, rejoicing in



<P>having extricated him from Randalls, and secured him the power



<P>of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of the evening.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You do quite right," said she;--"we will make your apologies



<P>to Mr. and Mrs. Weston."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But hardly had she so spoken, when she found her brother was civilly



<P>offering a seat in his carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton's



<P>only objection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much



<P>prompt satisfaction.&nbsp; It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go,



<P>and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than



<P>at this moment; never had his smile been stronger, nor his eyes



<P>more exulting than when he next looked at her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well," said she to herself, "this is most strange!--After I



<P>had got him off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave



<P>Harriet ill behind!--Most strange indeed!--But there is, I believe,



<P>in many men, especially single men, such an inclination--



<P>such a passion for dining out--a dinner engagement is so high in



<P>the class of their pleasures, their employments, their dignities,



<P>almost their duties, that any thing gives way to it--and this must



<P>be the case with Mr. Elton; a most valuable, amiable, pleasing young



<P>man undoubtedly, and very much in love with Harriet; but still,



<P>he cannot refuse an invitation, he must dine out wherever he is asked.



<P>What a strange thing love is! he can see ready wit in Harriet,



<P>but will not dine alone for her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she could not but do him



<P>the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment



<P>in his manner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his



<P>voice while assuring her that he should call at Mrs. Goddard's



<P>for news of her fair friend, the last thing before he prepared



<P>for the happiness of meeting her again, when he hoped to be



<P>able to give a better report; and he sighed and smiled himself



<P>off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley



<P>began with--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than



<P>Mr. Elton.&nbsp; It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned.



<P>With men he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies



<P>to please, every feature works."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr. Elton's manners are not perfect," replied Emma; "but where there



<P>is a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook



<P>a great deal.&nbsp; Where a man does his best with only moderate powers,



<P>he will have the advantage over negligent superiority.&nbsp; There is



<P>such perfect good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot



<P>but value."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness,



<P>"he seems to have a great deal of good-will towards you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Me!" she replied with a smile of astonishment, "are you imagining



<P>me to be Mr. Elton's object?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never



<P>occurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr. Elton in love with me!--What an idea!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether



<P>it is so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly.



<P>I think your manners to him encouraging.&nbsp; I speak as a friend,



<P>Emma.&nbsp; You had better look about you, and ascertain what you do,



<P>and what you mean to do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken.&nbsp; Mr. Elton



<P>and I are very good friends, and nothing more;" and she walked on,



<P>amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often



<P>arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes



<P>which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into;



<P>and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind



<P>and ignorant, and in want of counsel.&nbsp; He said no more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit,



<P>that in spite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea



<P>of shrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually



<P>with his eldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent



<P>consciousness of the weather than either of the others; too full



<P>of the wonder of his own going, and the pleasure it was to afford at



<P>Randalls to see that it was cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it.



<P>The cold, however, was severe; and by the time the second carriage



<P>was in motion, a few flakes of snow were finding their way down,



<P>and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only



<P>a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour.



<P>The preparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice



<P>of his children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,



<P>which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated



<P>nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase;



<P>and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in



<P>expressing his discontent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A man," said he, "must have a very good opinion of himself when



<P>he asks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such



<P>a day as this, for the sake of coming to see him.&nbsp; He must think



<P>himself a most agreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing.



<P>It is the greatest absurdity--Actually snowing at this moment!--



<P>The folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home--and the



<P>folly of people's not staying comfortably at home when they can!



<P>If we were obliged to go out such an evening as this, by any call of



<P>duty or business, what a hardship we should deem it;--and here are we,



<P>probably with rather thinner clothing than usual, setting forward



<P>voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of the voice of nature,



<P>which tells man, in every thing given to his view or his feelings,



<P>to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter that he can;--



<P>here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another



<P>man's house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said



<P>and heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.



<P>Going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;--four horses



<P>and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle,



<P>shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they



<P>might have had at home."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no

doubt



<P>he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the "Very true, my love,"



<P>which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion;



<P>but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer



<P>at all.&nbsp; She could not be complying, she dreaded being quarrelsome;



<P>her heroism reached only to silence.&nbsp; She allowed him to talk,



<P>and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening



<P>her lips.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down,



<P>and Mr. Elton, spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly.



<P>Emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject.&nbsp; Mr. Elton



<P>was all obligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful



<P>in his civilities indeed, that she began to think he must have



<P>received a different account of Harriet from what had reached her.



<P>She had sent while dressing, and the answer had been, "Much the same--



<P>not better."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My report from Mrs. Goddard's," said she presently, "was not



<P>so pleasant as I had hoped--`Not better' was my answer."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice



<P>of sentiment as he answered.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! no--I am grieved to find--I was on the point of telling you that



<P>when I called at Mrs. Goddard's door, which I did the very last thing



<P>before I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better,



<P>by no means better, rather worse.&nbsp; Very much grieved and concerned--



<P>I had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial



<P>as I knew had been given her in the morning."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma smiled and answered--"My visit was of use to the nervous part



<P>of her complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat;



<P>it is a most severe cold indeed.&nbsp; Mr. Perry has been with her,



<P>as you probably heard."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes--I imagined--that is--I did not--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow



<P>morning will bring us both a more comfortable report.&nbsp; But it is



<P>impossible not to feel uneasiness.&nbsp; Such a sad loss to our party

to-day!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dreadful!--Exactly so, indeed.--She will be missed every moment."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable;



<P>but it should have lasted longer.&nbsp; Emma was rather in dismay when



<P>only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things,



<P>and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What an excellent device," said he, "the use of a sheepskin



<P>for carriages.&nbsp; How very comfortable they make it;--impossible

to



<P>feel cold with such precautions.&nbsp; The contrivances of modern days



<P>indeed have rendered a gentleman's carriage perfectly complete.



<P>One is so fenced and guarded from the weather, that not a breath



<P>of air can find its way unpermitted.&nbsp; Weather becomes absolutely



<P>of no consequence.&nbsp; It is a very cold afternoon--but in this carriage



<P>we know nothing of the matter.--Ha! snows a little I see."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," said John Knightley, "and I think we shall have a good deal



<P>of it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Christmas weather," observed Mr. Elton.&nbsp; "Quite seasonable;



<P>and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not



<P>begin yesterday, and prevent this day's party, which it might very



<P>possibly have done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had



<P>there been much snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence.



<P>This is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings.&nbsp; At Christmas



<P>every body invites their friends about them, and people think little



<P>of even the worst weather.&nbsp; I was snowed up at a friend's house

once



<P>for a week.&nbsp; Nothing could be pleasanter.&nbsp; I went for only

one night,



<P>and could not get away till that very day se'nnight."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure,



<P>but said only, coolly,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too



<P>much astonished now at Mr. Elton's spirits for other feelings.



<P>Harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We are sure of excellent fires," continued he, "and every thing



<P>in the greatest comfort.&nbsp; Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;--



<P>Mrs. Weston indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly



<P>what one values, so hospitable, and so fond of society;--



<P>it will be a small party, but where small parties are select,



<P>they are perhaps the most agreeable of any.&nbsp; Mr. Weston's dining-room



<P>does not accommodate more than ten comfortably; and for my part,



<P>I would rather, under such circumstances, fall short by two than



<P>exceed by two.&nbsp; I think you will agree with me, (turning with a

soft



<P>air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation,



<P>though Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large parties



<P>of London, may not quite enter into our feelings."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir--I never dine



<P>with any body."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that the



<P>law had been so great a slavery.&nbsp; Well, sir, the time must come



<P>when you will be paid for all this, when you will have little



<P>labour and great enjoyment."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My first enjoyment," replied John Knightley, as they passed through



<P>the sweep-gate, "will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again."

<B>CHAPTER VII</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>The very day of Mr. Elton's going to London produced a fresh occasion



<P>for Emma's services towards her friend.&nbsp; Harriet had been at Hartfield,



<P>as usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home



<P>to return again to dinner: she returned, and sooner than had been



<P>talked of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something



<P>extraordinary to have happened which she was longing to tell.



<P>Half a minute brought it all out.&nbsp; She had heard, as soon as she

got



<P>back to Mrs. Goddard's, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before,



<P>and finding she was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left



<P>a little parcel for her from one of his sisters, and gone away;



<P>and on opening this parcel, she had actually found, besides the two



<P>songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself;



<P>and this letter was from him, from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct



<P>proposal of marriage.&nbsp; "Who could have thought it? She was so surprized



<P>she did not know what to do.&nbsp; Yes, quite a proposal of marriage;



<P>and a very good letter, at least she thought so.&nbsp; And he wrote



<P>as if he really loved her very much--but she did not know--and so,



<P>she was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she



<P>should do.--" Emma was half-ashamed of her friend for seeming so



<P>pleased and so doubtful.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Upon my word," she cried, "the young man is determined not to lose



<P>any thing for want of asking.&nbsp; He will connect himself well if

he can."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Will you read the letter?" cried Harriet.&nbsp; "Pray do.&nbsp; I'd

rather



<P>you would."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma was not sorry to be pressed.&nbsp; She read, and was surprized.



<P>The style of the letter was much above her expectation.



<P>There were not merely no grammatical errors, but as a composition it



<P>would not have disgraced a gentleman; the language, though plain,



<P>was strong and unaffected, and the sentiments it conveyed very much



<P>to the credit of the writer.&nbsp; It was short, but expressed good

sense,



<P>warm attachment, liberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling.



<P>She paused over it, while Harriet stood anxiously watching for



<P>her opinion, with a "Well, well," and was at last forced to add,



<P>"Is it a good letter? or is it too short?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, indeed, a very good letter," replied Emma rather slowly--"so



<P>good a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of



<P>his sisters must have helped him.&nbsp; I can hardly imagine the young



<P>man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself



<P>so well, if left quite to his own powers, and yet it is not the



<P>style of a woman; no, certainly, it is too strong and concise;



<P>not diffuse enough for a woman.&nbsp; No doubt he is a sensible man,



<P>and I suppose may have a natural talent for--thinks strongly and



<P>clearly--and when he takes a pen in hand, his thoughts naturally find



<P>proper words.&nbsp; It is so with some men.&nbsp; Yes, I understand

the sort



<P>of mind.&nbsp; Vigorous, decided, with sentiments to a certain point,



<P>not coarse.&nbsp; A better written letter, Harriet (returning it,)



<P>than I had expected."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well," said the still waiting Harriet;--" well--and-- and what



<P>shall I do?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard



<P>to this letter?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course--and speedily."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own.&nbsp; You will



<P>express yourself very properly, I am sure.&nbsp; There is no danger

of your



<P>not being intelligible, which is the first thing.&nbsp; Your meaning

must



<P>be unequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude



<P>and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires,



<P>will present themselves unbidden to your mind, I am persuaded.



<P>You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow



<P>for his disappointment."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You think I ought to refuse him then," said Harriet, looking down.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ought to refuse him! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you



<P>in any doubt as to that? I thought--but I beg your pardon, perhaps I



<P>have been under a mistake.&nbsp; I certainly have been misunderstanding



<P>you, if you feel in doubt as to the purport of your answer.



<P>I had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet was silent.&nbsp; With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I do not; that is, I do not mean--What shall I do? What would



<P>you advise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I



<P>ought to do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall not give you any advice, Harriet.&nbsp; I will have nothing

to



<P>do with it.&nbsp; This is a point which you must settle with your feelings."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I had no notion that he liked me so very much," said Harriet,



<P>contemplating the letter.&nbsp; For a little while Emma persevered



<P>in her silence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery



<P>of that letter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman doubts



<P>as to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought



<P>to refuse him.&nbsp; If she can hesitate as to `Yes,' she ought to say



<P>`No' directly.&nbsp; It is not a state to be safely entered into



<P>with doubtful feelings, with half a heart.&nbsp; I thought it my duty



<P>as a friend, and older than yourself, to say thus much to you.



<P>But do not imagine that I want to influence you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to--but if you



<P>would just advise me what I had best do--No, no, I do not mean



<P>that--As you say, one's mind ought to be quite made up--One should



<P>not be hesitating--It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer



<P>to say `No,' perhaps.--Do you think I had better say `No?'"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not for the world," said Emma, smiling graciously, "would I advise



<P>you either way.&nbsp; You must be the best judge of your own happiness.



<P>If you prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him



<P>the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should



<P>you hesitate? You blush, Harriet.--Does any body else occur to you



<P>at this moment under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not



<P>deceive yourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion.



<P>At this moment whom are you thinking of?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The symptoms were favourable.--Instead of answering, Harriet turned



<P>away confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though



<P>the letter was still in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted



<P>about without regard.&nbsp; Emma waited the result with impatience,



<P>but not without strong hopes.&nbsp; At last, with some hesitation,



<P>Harriet said--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must



<P>do as well as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined,



<P>and really almost made up my mind--to refuse Mr. Martin.&nbsp; Do you



<P>think I am right?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just



<P>what you ought.&nbsp; While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings



<P>to myself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no



<P>hesitation in approving.&nbsp; Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this.



<P>It would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have



<P>been the consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin.&nbsp; While you were

in



<P>the smallest degree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would



<P>not influence; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me.



<P>I could not have visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm.



<P>Now I am secure of you for ever."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck



<P>her forcibly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You could not have visited me!" she cried, looking aghast.



<P>"No, to be sure you could not; but I never thought of that before.



<P>That would have been too dreadful!--What an escape!--Dear Miss Woodhouse,



<P>I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you



<P>for any thing in the world."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you;



<P>but it must have been.&nbsp; You would have thrown yourself out of all



<P>good society.&nbsp; I must have given you up."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dear me!--How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed



<P>me never to come to Hartfield any more!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dear affectionate creature!--You banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!--You



<P>confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life!



<P>I wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it.



<P>He must have a pretty good opinion of himself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not think he is conceited either, in general," said Harriet,



<P>her conscience opposing such censure; "at least, he is very good natured,



<P>and I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a great regard



<P>for-- but that is quite a different thing from--and you know,



<P>though he may like me, it does not follow that I should--and



<P>certainly I must confess that since my visiting here I have seen



<P>people--and if one comes to compare them, person and manners,



<P>there is no comparison at all, one is so very handsome and agreeable.



<P>However, I do really think Mr. Martin a very amiable young man,



<P>and have a great opinion of him; and his being so much attached



<P>to me--and his writing such a letter--but as to leaving you,



<P>it is what I would not do upon any consideration."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend.&nbsp; We will not



<P>be parted.&nbsp; A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is

asked,



<P>or because he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh no;--and it is but a short letter too."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a



<P>"very true; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the



<P>clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day,



<P>to know that her husband could write a good letter."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! yes, very.&nbsp; Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be

always



<P>happy with pleasant companions.&nbsp; I am quite determined to refuse

him.



<P>But how shall I do? That shall I say?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer,



<P>and advised its being written directly, which was agreed to,



<P>in the hope of her assistance; and though Emma continued to protest



<P>against any assistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the



<P>formation of every sentence.&nbsp; The looking over his letter again,



<P>in replying to it, had such a softening tendency, that it was



<P>particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions;



<P>and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy,



<P>and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say,



<P>and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful,



<P>that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment,



<P>he would have been accepted after all.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent.



<P>The business was finished, and Harriet safe.&nbsp; She was rather low



<P>all the evening, but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets,



<P>and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection,



<P>sometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr. Elton.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again," was said in rather



<P>a sorrowful tone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet.



<P>You are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared



<P>to Abbey-Mill."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy



<P>but at Hartfield."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Some time afterwards it was, "I think Mrs. Goddard would be very



<P>much surprized if she knew what had happened.&nbsp; I am sure Miss Nash



<P>would--for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married,



<P>and it is only a linen-draper."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the



<P>teacher of a school, Harriet.&nbsp; I dare say Miss Nash would envy

you



<P>such an opportunity as this of being married.&nbsp; Even this conquest



<P>would appear valuable in her eyes.&nbsp; As to any thing superior for

you,



<P>I suppose she is quite in the dark.&nbsp; The attentions of a certain



<P>person can hardly be among the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet.



<P>Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his looks



<P>and manners have explained themselves."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering



<P>that people should like her so much.&nbsp; The idea of Mr. Elton was



<P>certainly cheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted



<P>again towards the rejected Mr. Martin.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Now he has got my letter," said she softly.&nbsp; "I wonder what they



<P>are all doing--whether his sisters know--if he is unhappy,



<P>they will be unhappy too.&nbsp; I hope he will not mind it so very much."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more



<P>cheerfully employed," cried Emma.&nbsp; "At this moment, perhaps, Mr.

Elton



<P>is shewing your picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much



<P>more beautiful is the original, and after being asked for it five



<P>or six times, allowing them to hear your name, your own dear name."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My picture!--But he has left my picture in Bond-street."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Has he so!--Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton.&nbsp; No, my dear



<P>little modest Harriet, depend upon it the picture will not be



<P>in Bond-street till just before he mounts his horse to-morrow.



<P>It is his companion all this evening, his solace, his delight.



<P>It opens his designs to his family, it introduces you among them,



<P>it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature,



<P>eager curiosity and warm prepossession.&nbsp; How cheerful, how animated,



<P>how suspicious, how busy their imaginations all are!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet's fancy



<P>a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity



<P>to a very good purpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible



<P>than before of Mr. Elton's being a remarkably handsome man, with most



<P>agreeable manners; and as she had no hesitation in following up



<P>the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints, she was soon



<P>pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet's side,



<P>as there could be any occasion for.&nbsp; She was quite convinced



<P>of Mr. Elton's being in the fairest way of falling in love,



<P>if not in love already.&nbsp; She had no scruple with regard to him.



<P>He talked of Harriet, and praised her so warmly, that she could



<P>not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add.



<P>His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet's manner,



<P>since her introduction at Hartfield, was not one of the least



<P>agreeable proofs of his growing attachment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You have given Miss Smith all that she required," said he;



<P>"you have made her graceful and easy.&nbsp; She was a beautiful creature



<P>when she came to you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have



<P>added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet



<P>only wanted drawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints.



<P>She had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness



<P>in herself.&nbsp; I have done very little."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If it were admissible to contradict a lady," said the gallant



<P>Mr. Elton--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character,



<P>have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her



<P>way before."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me.&nbsp; So much superadded



<P>decision of character! Skilful has been the hand!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Great has been the pleasure, I am sure.&nbsp; I never met with



<P>a disposition more truly amiable."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have no doubt of it." And it was spoken with a sort



<P>of sighing animation, which had a vast deal of the lover.



<P>She was not less pleased another day with the manner



<P>in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers, to have Harriet's picture.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?" said she: "did



<P>you ever sit for your picture?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say,



<P>with a very interesting naivete,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! dear, no, never."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>No sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be! I would



<P>give any money for it.&nbsp; I almost long to attempt her likeness myself.



<P>You do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had



<P>a great passion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of



<P>my friends, and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general.



<P>But from one cause or another, I gave it up in disgust.



<P>But really, I could almost venture, if Harriet would sit to me.



<P>It would be such a delight to have her picture!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Let me entreat you," cried Mr. Elton; "it would indeed be a delight!



<P>Let me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a



<P>talent in favour of your friend.&nbsp; I know what your drawings are.



<P>How could you suppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in



<P>specimens of your landscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston



<P>some inimitable figure-pieces in her drawing-room, at Randalls?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Yes, good man!--thought Emma--but what has all that to do with taking



<P>likenesses? You know nothing of drawing.&nbsp; Don't pretend to be



<P>in raptures about mine.&nbsp; Keep your raptures for Harriet's face.



<P>"Well, if you give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe



<P>I shall try what I can do.&nbsp; Harriet's features are very delicate,



<P>which makes a likeness difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity



<P>in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought



<P>to catch."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Exactly so--The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth--I



<P>have not a doubt of your success.&nbsp; Pray, pray attempt it.



<P>As you will do it, it will indeed, to use your own words,



<P>be an exquisite possession."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit.



<P>She thinks so little of her own beauty.&nbsp; Did not you observe her



<P>manner of answering me? How completely it meant, `why should my



<P>picture be drawn?'"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you.&nbsp; It was not lost on me.



<P>But still I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made;



<P>and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest



<P>pressing of both the others.&nbsp; Emma wished to go to work directly,



<P>and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts



<P>at portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that they



<P>might decide together on the best size for Harriet.&nbsp; Her many



<P>beginnings were displayed.&nbsp; Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths,



<P>pencil, crayon, and water-colours had been all tried in turn.



<P>She had always wanted to do every thing, and had made more progress



<P>both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little



<P>labour as she would ever submit to.&nbsp; She played and sang;--and

drew



<P>in almost every style; but steadiness had always been wanting;



<P>and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she



<P>would have been glad to command, and ought not to have failed of.



<P>She was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist



<P>or a musician, but she was not unwilling to have others deceived,



<P>or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher



<P>than it deserved.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was merit in every drawing--in the least finished, perhaps the

most;



<P>her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had there



<P>been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two companions



<P>would have been the same.&nbsp; They were both in ecstasies.&nbsp; A

likeness



<P>pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse's performances must be capital.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No great variety of faces for you," said Emma.&nbsp; "I had only my



<P>own family to study from.&nbsp; There is my father--another of my



<P>father--but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous,



<P>that I could only take him by stealth; neither of them very



<P>like therefore.&nbsp; Mrs. Weston again, and again, and again, you see.



<P>Dear Mrs. Weston! always my kindest friend on every occasion.



<P>She would sit whenever I asked her.&nbsp; There is my sister; and really



<P>quite her own little elegant figure!--and the face not unlike.



<P>I should have made a good likeness of her, if she would have



<P>sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four



<P>children that she would not be quiet.&nbsp; Then, here come all my



<P>attempts at three of those four children;--there they are,



<P>Henry and John and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other,



<P>and any one of them might do for any one of the rest.&nbsp; She was

so



<P>eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse; but there is no



<P>making children of three or four years old stand still you know;



<P>nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them, beyond the



<P>air and complexion, unless they are coarser featured than any



<P>of mama's children ever were.&nbsp; Here is my sketch of the fourth,



<P>who was a baby.&nbsp; I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa, and

it



<P>is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see.



<P>He had nestled down his head most conveniently.&nbsp; That's very like.



<P>I am rather proud of little George.&nbsp; The corner of the sofa is

very good.



<P>Then here is my last,"--unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman



<P>in small size, whole-length-- "my last and my best--my brother,



<P>Mr. John Knightley.&nbsp; --This did not want much of being finished,

when I



<P>put it away in a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness.



<P>I could not help being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I



<P>had really made a very good likeness of it--(Mrs. Weston and I



<P>were quite agreed in thinking it very like)--only too handsome--too



<P>flattering--but that was a fault on the right side-- after



<P>all this, came poor dear Isabella's cold approbation of--"Yes,



<P>it was a little like--but to be sure it did not do him justice."



<P>We had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all.



<P>It was made a great favour of; and altogether it was more than I



<P>could bear; and so I never would finish it, to have it apologised



<P>over as an unfavourable likeness, to every morning visitor in



<P>Brunswick Square;--and, as I said, I did then forswear ever drawing



<P>any body again.&nbsp; But for Harriet's sake, or rather for my own,



<P>and as there are no husbands and wives in the case at present,



<P>I will break my resolution now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea,



<P>and was repeating, "No husbands and wives in the case at present



<P>indeed, as you observe.&nbsp; Exactly so.&nbsp; No husbands and wives,"



<P>with so interesting a consciousness, that Emma began to consider



<P>whether she had not better leave them together at once.&nbsp; But as

she



<P>wanted to be drawing, the declaration must wait a little longer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait.



<P>It was to be a whole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John



<P>Knightley's, and was destined, if she could please herself,



<P>to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid



<P>of not keeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet



<P>mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist.



<P>But there was no doing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind



<P>her and watching every touch.&nbsp; She gave him credit for stationing



<P>himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence;



<P>but was really obliged to put an end to it, and request him to



<P>place himself elsewhere.&nbsp; It then occurred to her to employ him



<P>in reading.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness



<P>indeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen



<P>the irksomeness of Miss Smith's."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Elton was only too happy.&nbsp; Harriet listened, and Emma drew



<P>in peace.&nbsp; She must allow him to be still frequently coming to

look;



<P>any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover;



<P>and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil,



<P>to jump up and see the progress, and be charmed.--There was no



<P>being displeased with such an encourager, for his admiration



<P>made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible.



<P>She could not respect his eye, but his love and his complaisance



<P>were unexceptionable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite



<P>enough pleased with the first day's sketch to wish to go on.



<P>There was no want of likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude,



<P>and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure,



<P>to give a little more height, and considerably more elegance, she had



<P>great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last,



<P>and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both--a



<P>standing memorial of the beauty of one, the skill of the other,



<P>and the friendship of both; with as many other agreeable associations



<P>as Mr. Elton's very promising attachment was likely to add.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he ought,



<P>entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"By all means.&nbsp; We shall be most happy to consider you as one



<P>of the party."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction,



<P>took place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress



<P>of the picture, which was rapid and happy.&nbsp; Every body who saw

it



<P>was pleased, but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defended



<P>it through every criticism.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she



<P>wanted,"--observed Mrs. Weston to him--not in the least suspecting



<P>that she was addressing a lover.--"The expression of the eye is



<P>most correct, but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes.



<P>It is the fault of her face that she has them not."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Do you think so?" replied he.&nbsp; "I cannot agree with you.



<P>It appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature.



<P>I never saw such a likeness in my life.&nbsp; We must allow for the

effect



<P>of shade, you know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You have made her too tall, Emma," said Mr. Knightley.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly added,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall.&nbsp; Consider,



<P>she is sitting down--which naturally presents a different--which



<P>in short gives exactly the idea--and the proportions must



<P>be preserved, you know.&nbsp; Proportions, fore-shortening.--Oh no!

it



<P>gives one exactly the idea of such a height as Miss Smith's. Exactly

so indeed!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is very pretty," said Mr. Woodhouse.&nbsp; "So prettily done! Just



<P>as your drawings always are, my dear.&nbsp; I do not know any body who

draws



<P>so well as you do.&nbsp; The only thing I do not thoroughly like is,



<P>that she seems to be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl



<P>over her shoulders--and it makes one think she must catch cold."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer.



<P>Look at the tree."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You, sir, may say any thing," cried Mr. Elton, "but I must confess



<P>that I regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss



<P>Smith out of doors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable



<P>spirit! Any other situation would have been much less in character.



<P>The naivete of Miss Smith's manners--and altogether--Oh, it is



<P>most admirable! I cannot keep my eyes from it.&nbsp; I never saw such



<P>a likeness."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a



<P>few difficulties.&nbsp; It must be done directly; it must be done in

London;



<P>the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose

taste



<P>could be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all commissions,



<P>must not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr. Woodhouse



<P>could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs



<P>of December.&nbsp; But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton,



<P>than it was removed.&nbsp; His gallantry was always on the alert.



<P>"Might he be trusted with the commission, what infinite pleasure



<P>should he have in executing it! he could ride to London at any time.



<P>It was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being



<P>employed on such an errand."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He was too good!--she could not endure the thought!-- she would



<P>not give him such a troublesome office for the world,"--brought



<P>on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances,--and



<P>a very few minutes settled the business.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame,



<P>and give the directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it



<P>as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him, while he



<P>seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What a precious deposit!" said he with a tender sigh, as he



<P>received it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This man is almost too gallant to be in love," thought Emma.



<P>"I should say so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different



<P>ways of being in love.&nbsp; He is an excellent young man, and will

suit



<P>Harriet exactly; it will be an `Exactly so,' as he says himself;



<P>but he does sigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more



<P>than I could endure as a principal.&nbsp; I come in for a pretty good



<P>share as a second.&nbsp; But it is his gratitude on Harriet's account."

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Mr. Knightley was to dine with them--rather against the inclination



<P>of Mr. Woodhouse, who did not like that any one should share with him



<P>in Isabella's first day.&nbsp; Emma's sense of right however had decided

it;



<P>and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother,



<P>she had particular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late



<P>disagreement between Mr. Knightley and herself, in procuring him



<P>the proper invitation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She hoped they might now become friends again.&nbsp; She thought it



<P>was time to make up.&nbsp; Making-up indeed would not do.&nbsp; She

certainly



<P>had not been in the wrong, and he would never own that he had.



<P>Concession must be out of the question; but it was time to appear



<P>to forget that they had ever quarrelled; and she hoped it might rather



<P>assist the restoration of friendship, that when he came into the room



<P>she had one of the children with her--the youngest, a nice little girl



<P>about eight months old, who was now making her first visit to Hartfield,



<P>and very happy to be danced about in her aunt's arms.&nbsp; It did assist;



<P>for though he began with grave looks and short questions, he was soon



<P>led on to talk of them all in the usual way, and to take the child



<P>out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity.



<P>Emma felt they were friends again; and the conviction giving



<P>her at first great satisfaction, and then a little sauciness,



<P>she could not help saying, as he was admiring the baby,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and nieces.



<P>As to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different;



<P>but with regard to these children, I observe we never disagree."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men



<P>and women, and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your



<P>dealings with them, as you are where these children are concerned,



<P>we might always think alike."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To be sure--our discordancies must always arise from my being



<P>in the wrong."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," said he, smiling--"and reason good.&nbsp; I was sixteen years



<P>old when you were born."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A material difference then," she replied--"and no doubt you were



<P>much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does



<P>not the lapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings



<P>a good deal nearer?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes--a good deal nearer."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right,



<P>if we think differently."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years' experience, and

by



<P>not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child.&nbsp; Come, my dear

Emma,



<P>let us be friends, and say no more about it.&nbsp; Tell your aunt, little

Emma,



<P>that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing



<P>old grievances, and that if she were not wrong before, she is now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's true," she cried--"very true.&nbsp; Little Emma, grow up



<P>a better woman than your aunt.&nbsp; Be infinitely cleverer and not



<P>half so conceited.&nbsp; Now, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and

I



<P>have done.&nbsp; As far as good intentions went, we were both right,



<P>and I must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet



<P>proved wrong.&nbsp; I only want to know that Mr. Martin is not very,



<P>very bitterly disappointed."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A man cannot be more so," was his short, full answer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah!--Indeed I am very sorry.--Come, shake hands with me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John



<P>Knightley made his appearance, and "How d'ye do, George?" and "John,



<P>how are you?" succeeded in the true English style, burying under



<P>a calmness that seemed all but indifference, the real attachment



<P>which would have led either of them, if requisite, to do every thing



<P>for the good of the other.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined



<P>cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his



<P>dear Isabella, and the little party made two natural divisions;



<P>on one side he and his daughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys;



<P>their subjects totally distinct, or very rarely mixing--and Emma



<P>only occasionally joining in one or the other.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but principally



<P>of those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative,



<P>and who was always the greater talker.&nbsp; As a magistrate, he had



<P>generally some point of law to consult John about, or, at least,



<P>some curious anecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand



<P>the home-farm at Donwell, he had to tell what every field was to bear



<P>next year, and to give all such local information as could not fail



<P>of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been



<P>the longest part of his life, and whose attachments were strong.



<P>The plan of a drain, the change of a fence, the felling of a tree,



<P>and the destination of every acre for wheat, turnips, or spring corn,



<P>was entered into with as much equality of interest by John, as his



<P>cooler manners rendered possible; and if his willing brother ever



<P>left him any thing to inquire about, his inquiries even approached



<P>a tone of eagerness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying



<P>a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My poor dear Isabella," said he, fondly taking her hand,



<P>and interrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one



<P>of her five children--"How long it is, how terribly long since you



<P>were here!&nbsp; And how tired you must be after your journey!&nbsp;

You must



<P>go to bed early, my dear--and I recommend a little gruel to you



<P>before you go.--You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together.



<P>My dear Emma, suppose we all have a little gruel."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did,



<P>that both the Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article



<P>as herself;--and two basins only were ordered.&nbsp; After a little



<P>more discourse in praise of gruel, with some wondering at its



<P>not being taken every evening by every body, he proceeded to say,



<P>with an air of grave reflection,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn



<P>at South End instead of coming here.&nbsp; I never had much opinion



<P>of the sea air."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir--or we



<P>should not have gone.&nbsp; He recommended it for all the children,



<P>but particularly for the weakness in little Bella's throat,--



<P>both sea air and bathing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her



<P>any good; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced,



<P>though perhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very



<P>rarely of use to any body.&nbsp; I am sure it almost killed me once."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Come, come," cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject, "I must



<P>beg you not to talk of the sea.&nbsp; It makes me envious and miserable;--



<P>I who have never seen it!&nbsp; South End is prohibited, if you please.



<P>My dear Isabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry about



<P>Mr. Perry yet; and he never forgets you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! good Mr. Perry--how is he, sir?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, pretty well; but not quite well.&nbsp; Poor Perry is bilious,



<P>and he has not time to take care of himself--he tells me he has



<P>not time to take care of himself--which is very sad--but he is



<P>always wanted all round the country.&nbsp; I suppose there is not a

man



<P>in such practice anywhere.&nbsp; But then there is not so clever a man



<P>any where."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the children grow?



<P>I have a great regard for Mr. Perry.&nbsp; I hope he will be calling

soon.



<P>He will be so pleased to see my little ones."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to ask



<P>him about myself of some consequence.&nbsp; And, my dear, whenever he

comes,



<P>you had better let him look at little Bella's throat."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardly



<P>any uneasiness about it.&nbsp; Either bathing has been of the greatest



<P>service to her, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent



<P>embrocation of Mr. Wingfield's, which we have been applying



<P>at times ever since August."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been



<P>of use to her--and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation,



<P>I would have spoken to--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates," said Emma,



<P>"I have not heard one inquiry after them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! the good Bateses--I am quite ashamed of myself--but you



<P>mention them in most of your letters.&nbsp; I hope they are quite well.



<P>Good old Mrs. Bates--I will call upon her to-morrow, and take



<P>my children.--They are always so pleased to see my children.--



<P>And that excellent Miss Bates!--such thorough worthy people!--



<P>How are they, sir?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole.&nbsp; But poor Mrs. Bates



<P>had a bad cold about a month ago."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How sorry I am!&nbsp; But colds were never so prevalent as they have

been



<P>this autumn.&nbsp; Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them



<P>more general or heavy--except when it has been quite an influenza."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree



<P>you mention.&nbsp; Perry says that colds have been very general,



<P>but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November.



<P>Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it very sickly except--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always



<P>a sickly season.&nbsp; Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be.



<P>It is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!--



<P>and the air so bad!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, indeed--we are not at all in a bad air.&nbsp; Our part of London

is



<P>very superior to most others!--You must not confound us with London



<P>in general, my dear sir.&nbsp; The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square



<P>is very different from almost all the rest.&nbsp; We are so very airy!



<P>I should be unwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;--



<P>there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my



<P>children in:&nbsp; but we are so remarkably airy!--Mr. Wingfield thinks



<P>the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as



<P>to air."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield.&nbsp; You make the best of it--



<P>but after you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you



<P>different creatures; you do not look like the same.&nbsp; Now I cannot

say,



<P>that I think you are any of you looking well at present."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting those



<P>little nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never entirely



<P>free from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the children were



<P>rather pale before they went to bed, it was only because they were



<P>a little more tired than usual, from their journey and the happiness



<P>of coming.&nbsp; I hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow;



<P>for I assure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he did not believe



<P>he had ever sent us off altogether, in such good case.&nbsp; I trust,



<P>at least, that you do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill,"



<P>turning her eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her husband.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you.&nbsp; I think Mr. John



<P>Knightley very far from looking well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What is the matter, sir?--Did you speak to me?" cried Mr. John



<P>Knightley, hearing his own name.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you



<P>looking well--but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued.



<P>I could have wished, however, as you know, that you had seen



<P>Mr. Wingfield before you left home."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Isabella,"--exclaimed he hastily--"pray do not concern



<P>yourself about my looks.&nbsp; Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling



<P>yourself and the children, and let me look as I chuse."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother,"



<P>cried Emma, "about your friend Mr. Graham's intending to have a bailiff



<P>from Scotland, to look after his new estate.&nbsp; What will it answer?



<P>Will not the old prejudice be too strong?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced



<P>to give her attention again to her father and sister, she had nothing



<P>worse to hear than Isabella's kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax;



<P>and Jane Fairfax, though no great favourite with her in general,



<P>she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!" said Mrs. John Knightley.--



<P>"It is so long since I have seen her, except now and then for a moment



<P>accidentally in town!&nbsp; What happiness it must be to her good old



<P>grandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them!



<P>I always regret excessively on dear Emma's account that she cannot



<P>be more at Highbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose



<P>Colonel and Mrs. Campbell will not be able to part with her at all.



<P>She would be such a delightful companion for Emma."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another



<P>pretty kind of young person.&nbsp; You will like Harriet.&nbsp; Emma

could



<P>not have a better companion than Harriet."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am most happy to hear it--but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be



<P>so very accomplished and superior!--and exactly Emma's age."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of



<P>similar moment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening



<P>did not close without a little return of agitation.&nbsp; The gruel

came



<P>and supplied a great deal to be said--much praise and many comments--



<P>undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution,



<P>and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was



<P>never met with tolerable;--but, unfortunately, among the failures



<P>which the daughter had to instance, the most recent, and therefore



<P>most prominent, was in her own cook at South End, a young woman



<P>hired for the time, who never had been able to understand what she



<P>meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel, thin, but not too thin.



<P>Often as she had wished for and ordered it, she had never been able



<P>to get any thing tolerable.&nbsp; Here was a dangerous opening.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah!" said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes on



<P>her with tender concern.--The ejaculation in Emma's ear expressed,



<P>"Ah! there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to



<P>South End.&nbsp; It does not bear talking of."&nbsp; And for a little

while



<P>she hoped he would not talk of it, and that a silent rumination



<P>might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel.



<P>After an interval of some minutes, however, he began with,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn,



<P>instead of coming here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But why should you be sorry, sir?--I assure you, it did the children



<P>a great deal of good."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not



<P>have been to South End.&nbsp; South End is an unhealthy place.



<P>Perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon South End."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is



<P>quite a mistake, sir.--We all had our health perfectly well there,



<P>never found the least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield



<P>says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy;



<P>and I am sure he may be depended on, for he thoroughly understands



<P>the nature of the air, and his own brother and family have been



<P>there repeatedly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.--



<P>Perry was a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best



<P>of all the sea-bathing places.&nbsp; A fine open sea, he says, and very



<P>pure air.&nbsp; And, by what I understand, you might have had lodgings

there



<P>quite away from the sea--a quarter of a mile off--very comfortable.



<P>You should have consulted Perry."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;--only consider how



<P>great it would have been.--An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else



<P>should be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much



<P>to chuse between forty miles and an hundred.--Better not move at all,



<P>better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get



<P>into a worse air.&nbsp; This is just what Perry said.&nbsp; It seemed

to him



<P>a very ill-judged measure."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma's attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he



<P>had reached such a point as this, she could not wonder at her



<P>brother-in-law's breaking out.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mr. Perry," said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure,



<P>"would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for.



<P>Why does he make it any business of his, to wonder at what I do?--



<P>at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another?--I may



<P>be allowed, I hope, the use of my judgment as well as Mr. Perry.--



<P>I want his directions no more than his drugs."&nbsp; He paused--



<P>and growing cooler in a moment, added, with only sarcastic dryness,



<P>"If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children



<P>a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense



<P>or inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as willing to



<P>prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"True, true," cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready interposition--



<P>"very true.&nbsp; That's a consideration indeed.--But John, as to what

I



<P>was telling you of my idea of moving the path to Langham, of turning



<P>it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows,



<P>I cannot conceive any difficulty.&nbsp; I should not attempt it,



<P>if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people,



<P>but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path. . . .



<P>The only way of proving it, however, will be to turn to our maps.



<P>I shall see you at the Abbey to-morrow morning I hope, and then we



<P>will look them over, and you shall give me your opinion."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on



<P>his friend Perry, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciously,



<P>been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions;--



<P>but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed



<P>the present evil, and the immediate alertness of one brother,



<P>and better recollections of the other, prevented any renewal of it.

<B>CHAPTER VIII</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Harriet slept at Hartfield that night.&nbsp; For some weeks past she



<P>had been spending more than half her time there, and gradually



<P>getting to have a bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma



<P>judged it best in every respect, safest and kindest, to keep her



<P>with them as much as possible just at present.&nbsp; She was obliged



<P>to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs. Goddard's,



<P>but it was then to be settled that she should return to Hartfield,



<P>to make a regular visit of some days.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While she was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with



<P>Mr. Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made

up



<P>his mind to walk out, was persuaded by his daughter not to defer it,



<P>and was induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples



<P>of his own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose.



<P>Mr. Knightley, who had nothing of ceremony about him, was offering



<P>by his short, decided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted



<P>apologies and civil hesitations of the other.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you



<P>will not consider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take



<P>Emma's advice and go out for a quarter of an hour.&nbsp; As the sun



<P>is out, I believe I had better take my three turns while I can.



<P>I treat you without ceremony, Mr. Knightley.&nbsp; We invalids think

we



<P>are privileged people."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter.&nbsp; Emma will be

happy



<P>to entertain you.&nbsp; And therefore I think I will beg your excuse



<P>and take my three turns--my winter walk."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You cannot do better, sir."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley,



<P>but I am a very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you;



<P>and, besides, you have another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I



<P>think the sooner you go the better.&nbsp; I will fetch your greatcoat



<P>and open the garden door for you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of being



<P>immediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined



<P>for more chat.&nbsp; He began speaking of Harriet, and speaking



<P>of her with more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I cannot rate her beauty as you do," said he; "but she is a



<P>pretty little creature, and I am inclined to think very well of



<P>her disposition.&nbsp; Her character depends upon those she is with;



<P>but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be wanting."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Come," said he, "you are anxious for a compliment, so I will



<P>tell you that you have improved her.&nbsp; You have cured her of her



<P>school-girl's giggle; she really does you credit."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thank you.&nbsp; I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe

I



<P>had been of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow



<P>praise where they may.&nbsp; You do not often overpower me with it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are expecting her again, you say, this morning?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Almost every moment.&nbsp; She has been gone longer already than



<P>she intended."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Something has happened to delay her; some visitors perhaps."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Highbury gossips!--Tiresome wretches!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore



<P>said nothing.&nbsp; He presently added, with a smile,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you



<P>that I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon



<P>hear of something to her advantage."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Indeed! how so? of what sort?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A very serious sort, I assure you;" still smiling.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very serious! I can think of but one thing--Who is in love



<P>with her? Who makes you their confidant?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton's having dropt a hint.



<P>Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she knew



<P>Mr. Elton looked up to him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have reason to think," he replied, "that Harriet Smith will



<P>soon have an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable



<P>quarter:--Robert Martin is the man.&nbsp; Her visit to Abbey-Mill,



<P>this summer, seems to have done his business.&nbsp; He is desperately



<P>in love and means to marry her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He is very obliging," said Emma; "but is he sure that Harriet



<P>means to marry him?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, well, means to make her an offer then.&nbsp; Will that do? He

came



<P>to the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it.



<P>He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and,



<P>I believe, considers me as one of his best friends.&nbsp; He came to

ask



<P>me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early;



<P>whether I thought her too young: in short, whether I approved his



<P>choice altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being



<P>considered (especially since your making so much of her) as in a line



<P>of society above him.&nbsp; I was very much pleased with all that he

said.



<P>I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin.



<P>He always speaks to the purpose; open, straightforward, and very



<P>well judging.&nbsp; He told me every thing; his circumstances and plans,



<P>and what they all proposed doing in the event of his marriage.&nbsp;

He is



<P>an excellent young man, both as son and brother.&nbsp; I had no hesitation



<P>in advising him to marry.&nbsp; He proved to me that he could afford

it;



<P>and that being the case, I was convinced he could not do better.



<P>I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent him away very happy.



<P>If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he would have thought



<P>highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house thinking me the



<P>best friend and counsellor man ever had.&nbsp; This happened the night



<P>before last.&nbsp; Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not allow



<P>much time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not



<P>appear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should



<P>be at Mrs. Goddard's to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor,



<P>without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Pray, Mr. Knightley," said Emma, who had been smiling to herself



<P>through a great part of this speech, "how do you know that Mr. Martin



<P>did not speak yesterday?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Certainly," replied he, surprized, "I do not absolutely know it;



<P>but it may be inferred.&nbsp; Was not she the whole day with you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Come," said she, "I will tell you something, in return for what



<P>you have told me.&nbsp; He did speak yesterday--that is, he wrote,



<P>and was refused."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed;



<P>and Mr. Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure,



<P>as he stood up, in tall indignation, and said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her.



<P>What is the foolish girl about?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! to be sure," cried Emma, "it is always incomprehensible



<P>to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage.



<P>A man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing.&nbsp; But what is



<P>the meaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness,



<P>if it is so; but I hope you are mistaken."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I saw her answer!--nothing could be clearer."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You saw her answer!--you wrote her answer too.&nbsp; Emma, this is



<P>your doing.&nbsp; You persuaded her to refuse him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should



<P>not feel that I had done wrong.&nbsp; Mr. Martin is a very respectable



<P>young man, but I cannot admit him to be Harriet's equal; and am



<P>rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her.



<P>By your account, he does seem to have had some scruples.&nbsp; It is



<P>a pity that they were ever got over."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not Harriet's equal!" exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly;



<P>and with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, "No, he



<P>is not her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense



<P>as in situation.&nbsp; Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds

you.



<P>What are Harriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education,



<P>to any connexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural



<P>daughter of nobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision



<P>at all, and certainly no respectable relations.&nbsp; She is known only



<P>as parlour-boarder at a common school.&nbsp; She is not a sensible girl,



<P>nor a girl of any information.&nbsp; She has been taught nothing useful,



<P>and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself.



<P>At her age she can have no experience, and with her little wit,



<P>is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her.



<P>She is pretty, and she is good tempered, and that is all.



<P>My only scruple in advising the match was on his account, as being



<P>beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him.&nbsp; I felt that,



<P>as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better; and that

as



<P>to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do worse.



<P>But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing



<P>to trust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort



<P>of disposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led



<P>aright and turn out very well.&nbsp; The advantage of the match I felt



<P>to be all on her side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now)



<P>that there would be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck.



<P>Even your satisfaction I made sure of.&nbsp; It crossed my mind immediately



<P>that you would not regret your friend's leaving Highbury, for the



<P>sake of her being settled so well.&nbsp; I remember saying to myself,



<P>`Even Emma, with all her partiality for Harriet, will think this a



<P>good match.'"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say



<P>any such thing.&nbsp; What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense

and all



<P>his merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate



<P>friend! Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying



<P>a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I



<P>wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings.



<P>I assure you mine are very different.&nbsp; I must think your statement



<P>by no means fair.&nbsp; You are not just to Harriet's claims.



<P>They would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself;



<P>Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two, but he is undoubtedly



<P>her inferior as to rank in society.--The sphere in which she moves



<P>is much above his.--It would be a degradation."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married



<P>to a respectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense



<P>she may be called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense.



<P>She is not to pay for the offence of others, by being held below



<P>the level of those with whom she is brought up.--There can scarcely



<P>be a doubt that her father is a gentleman--and a gentleman of



<P>fortune.--Her allowance is very liberal; nothing has ever been grudged



<P>for her improvement or comfort.--That she is a gentleman's daughter,



<P>is indubitable to me; that she associates with gentlemen's daughters,



<P>no one, I apprehend, will deny.--She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Whoever might be her parents," said Mr. Knightley, "whoever may



<P>have had the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part



<P>of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society.



<P>After receiving a very indifferent education she is left in



<P>Mrs. Goddard's hands to shift as she can;--to move, in short,



<P>in Mrs. Goddard's line, to have Mrs. Goddard's acquaintance.



<P>Her friends evidently thought this good enough for her; and it was



<P>good enough.&nbsp; She desired nothing better herself.&nbsp; Till you

chose



<P>to turn her into a friend, her mind had no distaste for her own set,



<P>nor any ambition beyond it.&nbsp; She was as happy as possible with

the



<P>Martins in the summer.&nbsp; She had no sense of superiority then.



<P>If she has it now, you have given it.&nbsp; You have been no friend

to



<P>Harriet Smith, Emma.&nbsp; Robert Martin would never have proceeded

so far,



<P>if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him.



<P>I know him well.&nbsp; He has too much real feeling to address any



<P>woman on the haphazard of selfish passion.&nbsp; And as to conceit,



<P>he is the farthest from it of any man I know.&nbsp; Depend upon it he



<P>had encouragement."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this



<P>assertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before,



<P>are unjust to Harriet.&nbsp; Harriet's claims to marry well are not



<P>so contemptible as you represent them.&nbsp; She is not a clever girl,



<P>but she has better sense than you are aware of, and does not



<P>deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly.



<P>Waiving that point, however, and supposing her to be, as you



<P>describe her, only pretty and good-natured, let me tell you, that in



<P>the degree she possesses them, they are not trivial recommendations



<P>to the world in general, for she is, in fact, a beautiful girl,



<P>and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an hundred;



<P>and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject



<P>of beauty than they are generally supposed; till they do fall



<P>in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl,



<P>with such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired



<P>and sought after, of having the power of chusing from among many,



<P>consequently a claim to be nice.&nbsp; Her good-nature, too, is not

so very



<P>slight a claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thorough sweetness



<P>of temper and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a great



<P>readiness to be pleased with other people.&nbsp; I am very much mistaken



<P>if your sex in general would not think such beauty, and such temper,



<P>the highest claims a woman could possess."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have,



<P>is almost enough to make me think so too.&nbsp; Better be without sense,



<P>than misapply it as you do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"To be sure!" cried she playfully.&nbsp; "I know that is the feeling



<P>of you all.&nbsp; I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly



<P>what every man delights in--what at once bewitches his senses



<P>and satisfies his judgment.&nbsp; Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse.



<P>Were you, yourself, ever to marry, she is the very woman for you.



<P>And is she, at seventeen, just entering into life, just beginning



<P>to be known, to be wondered at because she does not accept the first



<P>offer she receives? No--pray let her have time to look about her."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy," said Mr. Knightley



<P>presently, "though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now



<P>perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet.



<P>You will puff her up with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what



<P>she has a claim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her



<P>reach will be good enough for her.&nbsp; Vanity working on a weak head,



<P>produces every sort of mischief.&nbsp; Nothing so easy as for a young

lady



<P>to raise her expectations too high.&nbsp; Miss Harriet Smith may not

find



<P>offers of marriage flow in so fast, though she is a very pretty girl.



<P>Men of sense, whatever you may chuse to say, do not want silly wives.



<P>Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves



<P>with a girl of such obscurity-- and most prudent men would be



<P>afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in,



<P>when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed.&nbsp; Let her

marry



<P>Robert Martin, and she is safe, respectable, and happy for ever;



<P>but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly, and teach



<P>her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence



<P>and large fortune, she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard's



<P>all the rest of her life--or, at least, (for Harriet Smith is a



<P>girl who will marry somebody or other,) till she grow desperate,



<P>and is glad to catch at the old writing-master's son."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley,



<P>that there can be no use in canvassing it.&nbsp; We shall only be making



<P>each other more angry.&nbsp; But as to my letting her marry Robert Martin,



<P>it is impossible; she has refused him, and so decidedly, I think,



<P>as must prevent any second application.&nbsp; She must abide by the

evil



<P>of having refused him, whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself,



<P>I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little;



<P>but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do.



<P>His appearance is so much against him, and his manner so bad,



<P>that if she ever were disposed to favour him, she is not now.



<P>I can imagine, that before she had seen any body superior,



<P>she might tolerate him.&nbsp; He was the brother of her friends,



<P>and he took pains to please her; and altogether, having seen



<P>nobody better (that must have been his great assistant)



<P>she might not, while she was at Abbey-Mill, find him disagreeable.



<P>But the case is altered now.&nbsp; She knows now what gentlemen are;



<P>and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance



<P>with Harriet."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!" cried Mr. Knightley.--"Robert



<P>Martin's manners have sense, sincerity, and good-humour to recommend



<P>them; and his mind has more true gentility than Harriet Smith could

understand."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was



<P>really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone.



<P>She did not repent what she had done; she still thought herself



<P>a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he



<P>could be; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment



<P>in general, which made her dislike having it so loudly against her;



<P>and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state,



<P>was very disagreeable.&nbsp; Some minutes passed in this unpleasant

silence,



<P>with only one attempt on Emma's side to talk of the weather,



<P>but he made no answer.&nbsp; He was thinking.&nbsp; The result of his

thoughts



<P>appeared at last in these words.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Robert Martin has no great loss--if he can but think so; and I



<P>hope it will not be long before he does.&nbsp; Your views for Harriet



<P>are best known to yourself; but as you make no secret of your love



<P>of match-making, it is fair to suppose that views, and plans,



<P>and projects you have;--and as a friend I shall just hint to you



<P>that if Elton is the man, I think it will be all labour in vain."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma laughed and disclaimed.&nbsp; He continued,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Depend upon it, Elton will not do.&nbsp; Elton is a very good sort

of man,



<P>and a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely



<P>to make an imprudent match.&nbsp; He knows the value of a good income



<P>as well as any body.&nbsp; Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will



<P>act rationally.&nbsp; He is as well acquainted with his own claims,

as you



<P>can be with Harriet's. He knows that he is a very handsome young man,



<P>and a great favourite wherever he goes; and from his general way



<P>of talking in unreserved moments, when there are only men present,



<P>I am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away.



<P>I have heard him speak with great animation of a large family



<P>of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with, who have all



<P>twenty thousand pounds apiece."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am very much obliged to you," said Emma, laughing again.



<P>"If I had set my heart on Mr. Elton's marrying Harriet, it would



<P>have been very kind to open my eyes; but at present I only want



<P>to keep Harriet to myself.&nbsp; I have done with match-making indeed.



<P>I could never hope to equal my own doings at Randalls.&nbsp; I shall

leave



<P>off while I am well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Good morning to you,"--said he, rising and walking off abruptly.



<P>He was very much vexed.&nbsp; He felt the disappointment of the young

man,



<P>and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the



<P>sanction he had given; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had



<P>taken in the affair, was provoking him exceedingly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more



<P>indistinctness in the causes of her's, than in his.&nbsp; She did not

always



<P>feel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that



<P>her opinions were right and her adversary's wrong, as Mr. Knightley.



<P>He walked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her.



<P>She was not so materially cast down, however, but that a little



<P>time and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives.



<P>Harriet's staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy.



<P>The possibility of the young man's coming to Mrs. Goddard's



<P>that morning, and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause,



<P>gave alarming ideas.&nbsp; The dread of such a failure after all became

the



<P>prominent uneasiness; and when Harriet appeared, and in very good spirits,



<P>and without having any such reason to give for her long absence,



<P>she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind,



<P>and convinced her, that let Mr. Knightley think or say what he would,



<P>she had done nothing which woman's friendship and woman's feelings



<P>would not justify.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she considered



<P>that Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done,



<P>neither with the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself,



<P>in spite of Mr. Knightley's pretensions) with the skill of such



<P>an observer on such a question as herself, that he had spoken it



<P>hastily and in anger, she was able to believe, that he had rather



<P>said what he wished resentfully to be true, than what he knew



<P>any thing about.&nbsp; He certainly might have heard Mr. Elton speak



<P>with more unreserve than she had ever done, and Mr. Elton might not



<P>be of an imprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to money matters;



<P>he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them;



<P>but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence



<P>of a strong passion at war with all interested motives.&nbsp; Mr. Knightley



<P>saw no such passion, and of course thought nothing of its effects;



<P>but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any



<P>hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest;



<P>and more than a reasonable, becoming degree of prudence, she was very



<P>sure did not belong to Mr. Elton.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet's cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back,



<P>not to think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton.&nbsp; Miss Nash



<P>had been telling her something, which she repeated immediately



<P>with great delight.&nbsp; Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard's to attend



<P>a sick child, and Miss Nash had seen him, and he had told Miss Nash,



<P>that as he was coming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he had met



<P>Mr. Elton, and found to his great surprize, that Mr. Elton was



<P>actually on his road to London, and not meaning to return till



<P>the morrow, though it was the whist-club night, which he had been



<P>never known to miss before; and Mr. Perry had remonstrated with him



<P>about it, and told him how shabby it was in him, their best player,



<P>to absent himself, and tried very much to persuade him to put off



<P>his journey only one day; but it would not do; Mr. Elton had been



<P>determined to go on, and had said in a very particular way indeed,



<P>that he was going on business which he would not put off for any



<P>inducement in the world; and something about a very enviable commission,



<P>and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious.&nbsp; Mr. Perry



<P>could not quite understand him, but he was very sure there must



<P>be a lady in the case, and he told him so; and Mr. Elton only



<P>looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great spirits.



<P>Miss Nash had told her all this, and had talked a great deal more



<P>about Mr. Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her,



<P>"that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be,



<P>but she only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer,



<P>she should think the luckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt,



<P>Mr. Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness."

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her, but Emma could not quarrel



<P>with herself.&nbsp; He was so much displeased, that it was longer than



<P>usual before he came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet,



<P>his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven.&nbsp; She was sorry,



<P>but could not repent.&nbsp; On the contrary, her plans and proceedings



<P>were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general



<P>appearances of the next few days.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after



<P>Mr. Elton's return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common



<P>sitting-room, he got up to look at it, and sighed out his half sentences



<P>of admiration just as he ought; and as for Harriet's feelings, they

were



<P>visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment



<P>as her youth and sort of mind admitted.&nbsp; Emma was soon perfectly



<P>satisfied of Mr. Martin's being no otherwise remembered, than as



<P>he furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantage to the

latter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Her views of improving her little friend's mind, by a great deal



<P>of useful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than



<P>a few first chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow.



<P>It was much easier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let



<P>her imagination range and work at Harriet's fortune, than to be



<P>labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts;



<P>and the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present,



<P>the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life,



<P>was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort



<P>that she could meet with, into a thin quarto of hot-pressed paper,



<P>made up by her friend, and ornamented with ciphers and trophies.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale



<P>are not uncommon.&nbsp; Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard's,



<P>had written out at least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken



<P>the first hint of it from her, hoped, with Miss Woodhouse's help,



<P>to get a great many more.&nbsp; Emma assisted with her invention,



<P>memory and taste; and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand,



<P>it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order, in form



<P>as well as quantity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls,



<P>and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in.



<P>"So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young-- he



<P>wondered he could not remember them! but he hoped he should in time."



<P>And it always ended in "Kitty, a fair but frozen maid."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His good friend Perry, too, whom he had spoken to on the subject,



<P>did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind;



<P>but he had desired Perry to be upon the watch, and as he went about



<P>so much, something, he thought, might come from that quarter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was by no means his daughter's wish that the intellects of



<P>Highbury in general should be put under requisition.&nbsp; Mr. Elton



<P>was the only one whose assistance she asked.&nbsp; He was invited



<P>to contribute any really good enigmas, charades, or conundrums



<P>that he might recollect; and she had the pleasure of seeing him



<P>most intently at work with his recollections; and at the same time,



<P>as she could perceive, most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant,



<P>nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass



<P>his lips.&nbsp; They owed to him their two or three politest puzzles;



<P>and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled,



<P>and rather sentimentally recited, that well-known charade,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first doth affliction denote,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which my second is destin'd to feel



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And my whole is the best antidote



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That affliction to soften and heal.--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it



<P>some pages ago already.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?" said she;



<P>"that is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be



<P>easier to you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh no! he had never written, hardly ever, any thing of the kind



<P>in his life.&nbsp; The stupidest fellow! He was afraid not even Miss



<P>Woodhouse"--he stopt a moment-- "or Miss Smith could inspire him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration.



<P>He called for a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the



<P>table containing, as he said, a charade, which a friend of his had



<P>addressed to a young lady, the object of his admiration, but which,



<P>from his manner, Emma was immediately convinced must be his own.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not offer it for Miss Smith's collection," said he.



<P>"Being my friend's, I have no right to expose it in any degree



<P>to the public eye, but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma



<P>could understand.&nbsp; There was deep consciousness about him,



<P>and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend's.



<P>He was gone the next moment:--after another moment's pause,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Take it," said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper towards



<P>Harriet--"it is for you.&nbsp; Take your own."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma,



<P>never loth to be first, was obliged to examine it herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To Miss--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHARADE.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lords of the earth! their luxury and

ease.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another view of man, my second brings,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold him there, the monarch of the

seas!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But ah! united, what reverse we have!



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Man's boasted power and freedom, all

are flown;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy ready wit the word will soon supply,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May its approval beam in that soft eye!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She cast her eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read it through



<P>again to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, and then



<P>passing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to herself,



<P>while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion



<P>of hope and dulness, "Very well, Mr. Elton, very well indeed.



<P>I have read worse charades.&nbsp; Courtship--a very good hint.&nbsp;

I give



<P>you credit for it.&nbsp; This is feeling your way.&nbsp; This is saying

very



<P>plainly-- `Pray, Miss Smith, give me leave to pay my addresses to you.



<P>Approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May its approval beam in that soft eye!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet exactly.&nbsp; Soft is the very word for her eye--of all epithets,



<P>the justest that could be given.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy ready wit the word will soon supply.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Humph--Harriet's ready wit! All the better.&nbsp; A man must be very

much



<P>in love, indeed, to describe her so.&nbsp; Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish



<P>you had the benefit of this; I think this would convince you.



<P>For once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken.



<P>An excellent charade indeed! and very much to the purpose.



<P>Things must come to a crisis soon now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations,



<P>which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by the



<P>eagerness of Harriet's wondering questions.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?--what can it be? I have not an idea--I



<P>cannot guess it in the least.&nbsp; What can it possibly be? Do try



<P>to find it out, Miss Woodhouse.&nbsp; Do help me.&nbsp; I never saw

any thing



<P>so hard.&nbsp; Is it kingdom? I wonder who the friend was--and who could



<P>be the young lady.&nbsp; Do you think it is a good one? Can it be woman?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Can it be Neptune?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold him there, the monarch of the

seas!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Or a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no! shark is only



<P>one syllable.&nbsp; It must be very clever, or he would not have brought

it.



<P>Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do you think we shall ever find it out?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mermaids and sharks! Nonsense! My dear Harriet, what are you



<P>thinking of? Where would be the use of his bringing us a charade made



<P>by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark? Give me the paper and listen.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For Miss ----------, read Miss Smith.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lords of the earth! their luxury and

ease.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That is court.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another view of man, my second brings;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behold him there, the monarch of the

seas!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That is ship;--plain as it can be.--Now for the cream.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But ah! united, (courtship, you know,) what reverse

we have!



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Man's boasted power and freedom, all

are flown.



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord of the earth and sea, he bends a slave,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A very proper compliment!--and then follows the application,



<P>which I think, my dear Harriet, you cannot find much difficulty



<P>in comprehending.&nbsp; Read it in comfort to yourself.&nbsp; There

can



<P>be no doubt of its being written for you and to you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion.



<P>She read the concluding lines, and was all flutter and happiness.



<P>She could not speak.&nbsp; But she was not wanted to speak.&nbsp; It

was enough



<P>for her to feel.&nbsp; Emma spoke for her.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is so pointed, and so particular a meaning in this compliment,"



<P>said she, "that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr. Elton's intentions.



<P>You are his object-- and you will soon receive the completest proof



<P>of it.&nbsp; I thought it must be so.&nbsp; I thought I could not be

so deceived;



<P>but now, it is clear; the state of his mind is as clear and decided,



<P>as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you.



<P>Yes, Harriet, just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance



<P>to happen what has happened.&nbsp; I could never tell whether an attachment



<P>between you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural.



<P>Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each



<P>other! I am very happy.&nbsp; I congratulate you, my dear Harriet, with

all



<P>my heart.&nbsp; This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride



<P>in creating.&nbsp; This is a connexion which offers nothing but good.



<P>It will give you every thing that you want--consideration, independence,



<P>a proper home--it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends,



<P>close to Hartfield and to me, and confirm our intimacy for ever.



<P>This, Harriet, is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either



<P>of us."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Dear Miss Woodhouse!"--and "Dear Miss Woodhouse," was all that Harriet,



<P>with many tender embraces could articulate at first; but when they



<P>did arrive at something more like conversation, it was sufficiently



<P>clear to her friend that she saw, felt, anticipated, and remembered



<P>just as she ought.&nbsp; Mr. Elton's superiority had very ample acknowledgment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Whatever you say is always right," cried Harriet, "and therefore



<P>I suppose, and believe, and hope it must be so; but otherwise I could



<P>not have imagined it.&nbsp; It is so much beyond any thing I deserve.



<P>Mr. Elton, who might marry any body! There cannot be two opinions



<P>about him.&nbsp; He is so very superior.&nbsp; Only think of those sweet



<P>verses--"To Miss --------." Dear me, how clever!--Could it really



<P>be meant for me?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I cannot make a question, or listen to a question about that.



<P>It is a certainty.&nbsp; Receive it on my judgment.&nbsp; It is a sort



<P>of prologue to the play, a motto to the chapter; and will be soon



<P>followed by matter-of-fact prose."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected.&nbsp; I am

sure,



<P>a month ago, I had no more idea myself!--The strangest things do



<P>take place!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"When Miss Smiths and Mr. Eltons get acquainted--they do indeed--and



<P>really it is strange; it is out of the common course that what is



<P>so evidently, so palpably desirable--what courts the pre-arrangement



<P>of other people, should so immediately shape itself into the proper

form.



<P>You and Mr. Elton are by situation called together; you belong



<P>to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes.



<P>Your marrying will be equal to the match at Randalls.&nbsp; There does



<P>seem to be a something in the air of Hartfield which gives love



<P>exactly the right direction, and sends it into the very channel



<P>where it ought to flow.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The course of true love never did run

smooth--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that passage."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That Mr. Elton should really be in love with me,--me, of all people,



<P>who did not know him, to speak to him, at Michaelmas! And he,



<P>the very handsomest man that ever was, and a man that every body



<P>looks up to, quite like Mr. Knightley! His company so sought after,



<P>that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he



<P>does not chuse it; that he has more invitations than there are days



<P>in the week.&nbsp; And so excellent in the Church! Miss Nash has put

down



<P>all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to Highbury.



<P>Dear me! When I look back to the first time I saw him! How little



<P>did I think!-- The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and



<P>peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by, and Miss



<P>Nash came and scolded us away, and staid to look through herself;



<P>however, she called me back presently, and let me look too,



<P>which was very good-natured. And how beautiful we thought he looked!



<P>He was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"This is an alliance which, whoever--whatever your friends may be,



<P>must be agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense;



<P>and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools.&nbsp; If they



<P>are anxious to see you happily married, here is a man whose amiable



<P>character gives every assurance of it;--if they wish to have you



<P>settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen



<P>to place you in, here it will be accomplished; and if their only



<P>object is that you should, in the common phrase, be well married,



<P>here is the comfortable fortune, the respectable establishment,



<P>the rise in the world which must satisfy them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, very true.&nbsp; How nicely you talk; I love to hear you.



<P>You understand every thing.&nbsp; You and Mr. Elton are one as clever



<P>as the other.&nbsp; This charade!--If I had studied a twelvemonth,



<P>I could never have made any thing like it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I thought he meant to try his skill, by his manner of declining



<P>it yesterday."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever read."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I never read one more to the purpose, certainly."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is as long again as almost all we have had before."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour.



<P>Such things in general cannot be too short."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear.&nbsp; The most satisfactory



<P>comparisons were rising in her mind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is one thing," said she, presently--her cheeks in a glow--"to



<P>have very good sense in a common way, like every body else,



<P>and if there is any thing to say, to sit down and write a letter,



<P>and say just what you must, in a short way; and another, to write



<P>verses and charades like this."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin's

prose.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Such sweet lines!" continued Harriet--"these two last!--But



<P>how shall I ever be able to return the paper, or say I have found



<P>it out?--Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what can we do about that?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Leave it to me.&nbsp; You do nothing.&nbsp; He will be here this evening,



<P>I dare say, and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense



<P>or other will pass between us, and you shall not be committed.--Your



<P>soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming.&nbsp; Trust to me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful



<P>charade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half so good."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you



<P>should not write it into your book."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! but those two lines are"--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>--"The best of all.&nbsp; Granted;--for private enjoyment; and for private



<P>enjoyment keep them.&nbsp; They are not at all the less written you

know,



<P>because you divide them.&nbsp; The couplet does not cease to be, nor

does



<P>its meaning change.&nbsp; But take it away, and all appropriation ceases,



<P>and a very pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection.



<P>Depend upon it, he would not like to have his charade slighted,



<P>much better than his passion.&nbsp; A poet in love must be encouraged

in



<P>both capacities, or neither.&nbsp; Give me the book, I will write it

down,



<P>and then there can be no possible reflection on you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts,



<P>so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down



<P>a declaration of love.&nbsp; It seemed too precious an offering for

any



<P>degree of publicity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I shall never let that book go out of my own hands," said she.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Very well," replied Emma; "a most natural feeling; and the longer



<P>it lasts, the better I shall be pleased.&nbsp; But here is my father



<P>coming: you will not object to my reading the charade to him.



<P>It will be giving him so much pleasure! He loves any thing of



<P>the sort, and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment.



<P>He has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all!-- You must



<P>let me read it to him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Harriet looked grave.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this



<P>charade.--You will betray your feelings improperly, if you are



<P>too conscious and too quick, and appear to affix more meaning,



<P>or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it.



<P>Do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration.



<P>If he had been anxious for secrecy, he would not have left the paper



<P>while I was by; but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you.



<P>Do not let us be too solemn on the business.&nbsp; He has encouragement



<P>enough to proceed, without our sighing out our souls over this charade."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! no--I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it.&nbsp; Do as you

please."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again,



<P>by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of "Well, my dears,



<P>how does your book go on?--Have you got any thing fresh?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh.



<P>A piece of paper was found on the table this morning--(dropt,



<P>we suppose, by a fairy)-- containing a very pretty charade, and we



<P>have just copied it in."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read,



<P>slowly and distinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations



<P>of every part as she proceeded-- and he was very much pleased, and,



<P>as she had foreseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Aye, that's very just, indeed, that's very properly said.



<P>Very true.&nbsp; `Woman, lovely woman.' It is such a pretty charade,



<P>my dear, that I can easily guess what fairy brought it.-- Nobody



<P>could have written so prettily, but you, Emma."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma only nodded, and smiled.--After a little thinking,



<P>and a very tender sigh, he added,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother



<P>was so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! But I



<P>can remember nothing;--not even that particular riddle which you



<P>have heard me mention; I can only recollect the first stanza;



<P>and there are several.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kitty, a fair but frozen maid,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kindled a flame I yet deplore,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hood-wink'd boy I called to aid,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though of his near approach afraid,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So fatal to my suit before.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And that is all that I can recollect of it--but it is very clever



<P>all the way through.&nbsp; But I think, my dear, you said you had got

it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page.&nbsp; We copied it



<P>from the Elegant Extracts.&nbsp; It was Garrick's, you know."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Aye, very true.--I wish I could recollect more of it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kitty, a fair but frozen maid.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near



<P>being christened Catherine after her grandmama.&nbsp; I hope we shall



<P>have her here next week.&nbsp; Have you thought, my dear, where you



<P>shall put her--and what room there will be for the children?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! yes--she will have her own room, of course; the room she always



<P>has;--and there is the nursery for the children,--just as usual,



<P>you know.&nbsp; Why should there be any change?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not know, my dear--but it is so long since she was here!--not



<P>since last Easter, and then only for a few days.--Mr. John Knightley's



<P>being a lawyer is very inconvenient.--Poor Isabella!--she is sadly



<P>taken away from us all!--and how sorry she will be when she comes,



<P>not to see Miss Taylor here!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"She will not be surprized, papa, at least."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not know, my dear.&nbsp; I am sure I was very much surprized



<P>when I first heard she was going to be married."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella



<P>is here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, my dear, if there is time.--But--(in a very depressed tone)--she



<P>is coming for only one week.&nbsp; There will not be time for any thing."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer--but it seems a case



<P>of necessity.&nbsp; Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the

28th,



<P>and we ought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole



<P>of the time they can give to the country, that two or three days



<P>are not to be taken out for the Abbey.&nbsp; Mr. Knightley promises



<P>to give up his claim this Christmas-- though you know it is longer



<P>since they were with him, than with us."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were



<P>to be anywhere but at Hartfield."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley's claims on



<P>his brother, or any body's claims on Isabella, except his own.



<P>He sat musing a little while, and then said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back



<P>so soon, though he does.&nbsp; I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade



<P>her to stay longer with us.&nbsp; She and the children might stay very

well."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah! papa--that is what you never have been able to accomplish,



<P>and I do not think you ever will.&nbsp; Isabella cannot bear to stay



<P>behind her husband."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This was too true for contradiction.&nbsp; Unwelcome as it was, Mr.

Woodhouse



<P>could only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits



<P>affected by the idea of his daughter's attachment to her husband,



<P>she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while



<P>my brother and sister are here.&nbsp; I am sure she will be pleased



<P>with the children.&nbsp; We are very proud of the children, are not

we,



<P>papa? I wonder which she will think the handsomest, Henry or John?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Aye, I wonder which she will.&nbsp; Poor little dears, how glad they



<P>will be to come.&nbsp; They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I dare say they are, sir.&nbsp; I am sure I do not know who is not."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama.&nbsp; Henry is

the eldest,



<P>he was named after me, not after his father.&nbsp; John, the second,



<P>is named after his father.&nbsp; Some people are surprized, I believe,



<P>that the eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry,



<P>which I thought very pretty of her.&nbsp; And he is a very clever boy,



<P>indeed.&nbsp; They are all remarkably clever; and they have so many



<P>pretty ways.&nbsp; They will come and stand by my chair, and say,



<P>`Grandpapa, can you give me a bit of string?' and once Henry asked me



<P>for a knife, but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas.



<P>I think their father is too rough with them very often."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He appears rough to you," said Emma, "because you are so very



<P>gentle yourself; but if you could compare him with other papas,



<P>you would not think him rough.&nbsp; He wishes his boys to be active

and hardy;



<P>and if they misbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then;



<P>but he is an affectionate father--certainly Mr. John Knightley



<P>is an affectionate father.&nbsp; The children are all fond of him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling



<P>in a very frightful way!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much.



<P>It is such enjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down



<P>the rule of their taking turns, whichever began would never give way



<P>to the other."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I cannot understand it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That is the case with us all, papa.&nbsp; One half of the world cannot



<P>understand the pleasures of the other."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Later in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate



<P>in preparation for the regular four o'clock dinner, the hero



<P>of this inimitable charade walked in again.&nbsp; Harriet turned away;



<P>but Emma could receive him with the usual smile, and her quick eye



<P>soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push--of



<P>having thrown a die; and she imagined he was come to see how it



<P>might turn up.&nbsp; His ostensible reason, however, was to ask whether



<P>Mr. Woodhouse's party could be made up in the evening without him,



<P>or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at Hartfield.



<P>If he were, every thing else must give way; but otherwise his friend



<P>Cole had been saying so much about his dining with him--had made



<P>such a point of it, that he had promised him conditionally to come.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his



<P>friend on their account; her father was sure of his rubber.



<P>He re-urged --she re-declined; and he seemed then about to make



<P>his bow, when taking the paper from the table, she returned it--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us;



<P>thank you for the sight of it.&nbsp; We admired it so much, that I have



<P>ventured to write it into Miss Smith's collection.&nbsp; Your friend



<P>will not take it amiss I hope.&nbsp; Of course I have not transcribed



<P>beyond the first eight lines."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say.



<P>He looked rather doubtingly--rather confused; said something about



<P>"honour,"--glanced at Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book



<P>open on the table, took it up, and examined it very attentively.



<P>With the view of passing off an awkward moment, Emma smilingly said,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade



<P>must not be confined to one or two.&nbsp; He may be sure of every woman's



<P>approbation while he writes with such gallantry."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I have no hesitation in saying," replied Mr. Elton, though hesitating



<P>a good deal while he spoke; "I have no hesitation in saying--at



<P>least if my friend feels at all as I do--I have not the smallest



<P>doubt that, could he see his little effusion honoured as I see it,



<P>(looking at the book again, and replacing it on the table), he



<P>would consider it as the proudest moment of his life."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After this speech he was gone as soon as possible.&nbsp; Emma could

not



<P>think it too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities,



<P>there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt



<P>to incline her to laugh.&nbsp; She ran away to indulge the inclination,



<P>leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet's share.

<B>CHAPTER XVIII</B>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>Mr. Frank Churchill did not come.&nbsp; When the time proposed



<P>drew near, Mrs. Weston's fears were justified in the arrival



<P>of a letter of excuse.&nbsp; For the present, he could not be spared,



<P>to his "very great mortification and regret; but still he looked



<P>forward with the hope of coming to Randalls at no distant period."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed--much more disappointed,



<P>in fact, than her husband, though her dependence on seeing the



<P>young man had been so much more sober:&nbsp; but a sanguine temper,



<P>though for ever expecting more good than occurs, does not



<P>always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression.



<P>It soon flies over the present failure, and begins to hope again.



<P>For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized and sorry; but then he



<P>began to perceive that Frank's coming two or three months later



<P>would be a much better plan; better time of year; better weather;



<P>and that he would be able, without any doubt, to stay considerably



<P>longer with them than if he had come sooner.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These feelings rapidly restored his comfort, while Mrs. Weston,



<P>of a more apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition



<P>of excuses and delays; and after all her concern for what her husband



<P>was to suffer, suffered a great deal more herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really



<P>about Mr. Frank Churchill's not coming, except as a disappointment



<P>at Randalls.&nbsp; The acquaintance at present had no charm for her.



<P>She wanted, rather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as

it



<P>was desirable that she should appear, in general, like her usual self,



<P>she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance,



<P>and enter as warmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston's disappointment,



<P>as might naturally belong to their friendship.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>She was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed



<P>quite as much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps



<P>rather more,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away.



<P>She then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of the



<P>advantage of such an addition to their confined society in Surry;



<P>the pleasure of looking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire,



<P>which the sight of him would have made; and ending with reflections



<P>on the Churchills again, found herself directly involved in a



<P>disagreement with Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement,



<P>perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her



<P>real opinion, and making use of Mrs. Weston's arguments against herself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"The Churchills are very likely in fault," said Mr. Knightley,



<P>coolly; "but I dare say he might come if he would."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I do not know why you should say so.&nbsp; He wishes exceedingly to

come;



<P>but his uncle and aunt will not spare him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made



<P>a point of it.&nbsp; It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without

proof."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How odd you are!&nbsp; What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you



<P>suppose him such an unnatural creature?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting



<P>that he may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care



<P>very little for any thing but his own pleasure, from living with



<P>those who have always set him the example of it.&nbsp; It is a great

deal



<P>more natural than one could wish, that a young man, brought up



<P>by those who are proud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud,



<P>luxurious, and selfish too.&nbsp; If Frank Churchill had wanted to see



<P>his father, he would have contrived it between September and January.



<P>A man at his age--what is he?--three or four-and-twenty--cannot be



<P>without the means of doing as much as that.&nbsp; It is impossible."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always



<P>been your own master.&nbsp; You are the worst judge in the world,



<P>Mr. Knightley, of the difficulties of dependence.&nbsp; You do not know



<P>what it is to have tempers to manage."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty



<P>should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount.&nbsp; He cannot



<P>want money--he cannot want leisure.&nbsp; We know, on the contrary,



<P>that he has so much of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at



<P>the idlest haunts in the kingdom.&nbsp; We hear of him for ever at some



<P>watering-place or other.&nbsp; A little while ago, he was at Weymouth.



<P>This proves that he can leave the Churchills."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, sometimes he can."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while;



<P>whenever there is any temptation of pleasure."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It is very unfair to judge of any body's conduct, without an



<P>intimate knowledge of their situation.&nbsp; Nobody, who has not been



<P>in the interior of a family, can say what the difficulties



<P>of any individual of that family may be.&nbsp; We ought to be



<P>acquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs. Churchill's temper,



<P>before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do.



<P>He may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he can at others."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses,



<P>and that is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour



<P>and resolution.&nbsp; It is Frank Churchill's duty to pay this attention



<P>to his father.&nbsp; He knows it to be so, by his promises and messages;



<P>but if he wished to do it, it might be done.&nbsp; A man who felt rightly



<P>would say at once, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill--



<P>`Every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make



<P>to your convenience; but I must go and see my father immediately.



<P>I know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him



<P>on the present occasion.&nbsp; I shall, therefore, set off to-morrow.'--



<P>If he would say so to her at once, in the tone of decision becoming



<P>a man, there would be no opposition made to his going."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No," said Emma, laughing; "but perhaps there might be some made to

his



<P>coming back again.&nbsp; Such language for a young man entirely dependent,



<P>to use!--Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it possible.



<P>But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly



<P>opposite to your own.&nbsp; Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such



<P>a speech as that to the uncle and aunt, who have brought him up,



<P>and are to provide for him!--Standing up in the middle of the room,



<P>I suppose, and speaking as loud as he could!--How can you imagine



<P>such conduct practicable?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it.



<P>He would feel himself in the right; and the declaration--made,



<P>of course, as a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner--



<P>would do him more good, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger



<P>with the people he depended on, than all that a line of shifts



<P>and expedients can ever do.&nbsp; Respect would be added to affection.



<P>They would feel that they could trust him; that the nephew who had



<P>done rightly by his father, would do rightly by them; for they know,



<P>as well as he does, as well as all the world must know, that he



<P>ought to pay this visit to his father; and while meanly exerting



<P>their power to delay it, are in their hearts not thinking the better



<P>of him for submitting to their whims.&nbsp; Respect for right conduct



<P>is felt by every body.&nbsp; If he would act in this sort of manner,



<P>on principle, consistently, regularly, their little minds would bend



<P>to his."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I rather doubt that.&nbsp; You are very fond of bending little minds;



<P>but where little minds belong to rich people in authority,



<P>I think they have a knack of swelling out, till they are quite as



<P>unmanageable as great ones.&nbsp; I can imagine, that if you, as you

are,



<P>Mr. Knightley, were to be transported and placed all at once in



<P>Mr. Frank Churchill's situation, you would be able to say and do



<P>just what you have been recommending for him; and it might have



<P>a very good effect.&nbsp; The Churchills might not have a word to say



<P>in return; but then, you would have no habits of early obedience



<P>and long observance to break through.&nbsp; To him who has, it might



<P>not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence,



<P>and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought.



<P>He may have as strong a sense of what would be right, as you can have,



<P>without being so equal, under particular circumstances, to act up



<P>to it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Then it would not be so strong a sense.&nbsp; If it failed to produce



<P>equal exertion, it could not be an equal conviction."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, the difference of situation and habit!&nbsp; I wish you would try



<P>to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel



<P>in directly opposing those, whom as child and boy he has been



<P>looking up to all his life."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the first



<P>occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against



<P>the will of others.&nbsp; It ought to have been a habit with him by



<P>this time, of following his duty, instead of consulting expediency.



<P>I can allow for the fears of the child, but not of the man.



<P>As he became rational, he ought to have roused himself and shaken off



<P>all that was unworthy in their authority.&nbsp; He ought to have opposed



<P>the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father.



<P>Had he begun as he ought, there would have been no difficulty now."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We shall never agree about him," cried Emma; "but that is



<P>nothing extraordinary.&nbsp; I have not the least idea of his being



<P>a weak young man:&nbsp; I feel sure that he is not.&nbsp; Mr. Weston

would



<P>not be blind to folly, though in his own son; but he is very likely



<P>to have a more yielding, complying, mild disposition than would suit



<P>your notions of man's perfection.&nbsp; I dare say he has; and though



<P>it may cut him off from some advantages, it will secure him many others."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move,



<P>and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself



<P>extremely expert in finding excuses for it.&nbsp; He can sit down and



<P>write a fine flourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods,



<P>and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method



<P>in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father's



<P>having any right to complain.&nbsp; His letters disgust me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Your feelings are singular.&nbsp; They seem to satisfy every body else."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston.&nbsp; They hardly can



<P>satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings:&nbsp; standing

in



<P>a mother's place, but without a mother's affection to blind her.



<P>It is on her account that attention to Randalls is doubly due,



<P>and she must doubly feel the omission.&nbsp; Had she been a person



<P>of consequence herself, he would have come I dare say; and it would



<P>not have signified whether he did or no.&nbsp; Can you think your friend



<P>behindhand in these sort of considerations?&nbsp; Do you suppose she



<P>does not often say all this to herself?&nbsp; No, Emma, your amiable



<P>young man can be amiable only in French, not in English.&nbsp; He may

be



<P>very `aimable,' have very good manners, and be very agreeable; but he



<P>can have no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people:



<P>nothing really amiable about him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You seem determined to think ill of him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Me!--not at all," replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; "I do



<P>not want to think ill of him.&nbsp; I should be as ready to acknowledge



<P>his merits as any other man; but I hear of none, except what are



<P>merely personal; that he is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth,



<P>plausible manners."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be a



<P>treasure at Highbury.&nbsp; We do not often look upon fine young men,



<P>well-bred and agreeable.&nbsp; We must not be nice and ask for all



<P>the virtues into the bargain.&nbsp; Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley,



<P>what a sensation his coming will produce?&nbsp; There will be but one

subject



<P>throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest--



<P>one object of curiosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill;



<P>we shall think and speak of nobody else."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find him



<P>conversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only



<P>a chattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"My idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the taste



<P>of every body, and has the power as well as the wish of being



<P>universally agreeable.&nbsp; To you, he will talk of farming; to me,



<P>of drawing or music; and so on to every body, having that general



<P>information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead,



<P>or take the lead, just as propriety may require, and to speak



<P>extremely well on each; that is my idea of him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"And mine," said Mr. Knightley warmly, "is, that if he turn out any



<P>thing like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing!



<P>What! at three-and-twenty to be the king of his company--the great man--



<P>the practised politician, who is to read every body's character,



<P>and make every body's talents conduce to the display of his



<P>own superiority; to be dispensing his flatteries around, that he



<P>may make all appear like fools compared with himself!&nbsp; My dear

Emma,



<P>your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came



<P>to the point."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I will say no more about him," cried Emma, "you turn every



<P>thing to evil.&nbsp; We are both prejudiced; you against, I for him;



<P>and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Prejudiced!&nbsp; I am not prejudiced."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"But I am very much, and without being at all ashamed of it.



<P>My love for Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in



<P>his favour."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He is a person I never think of from one month's end to another,"



<P>said Mr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emma



<P>immediately talk of something else, though she could not comprehend



<P>why he should be angry.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To take a dislike to a young man, only because he appeared to be



<P>of a different disposition from himself, was unworthy the real



<P>liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him;



<P>for with all the high opinion of himself, which she had often laid



<P>to his charge, she had never before for a moment supposed it could



<P>make him unjust to the merit of another.
