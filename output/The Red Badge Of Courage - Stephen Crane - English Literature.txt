<BR>&nbsp;



<P>THE youth stared at the land in front of him.



<P>Its foliages now seemed to veil powers and hor-



<P>rors.&nbsp; He was unaware of the machinery of orders



<P>that started the charge, although from the cor-



<P>ners of his eyes he saw an officer, who looked



<P>like a boy a-horseback, come galloping, waving



<P>his hat.&nbsp; Suddenly he felt a straining and heaving



<P>among the men.&nbsp; The line fell slowly forward



<P>like a toppling wall, and, with a convulsive gasp



<P>that was intended for a cheer, the regiment began



<P>its journey.&nbsp; The youth was pushed and jostled



<P>for a moment before he understood the move-



<P>ment at all, but directly he lunged ahead and



<P>began to run.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He fixed his eye upon a distant and promi-



<P>nent clump of trees where he had concluded the



<P>enemy were to be met, and he ran toward it as



<P>toward a goal.&nbsp; He had believed throughout that



<P>it was a mere question of getting over an unpleas-



<P>ant matter as quickly as possible, and he ran

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>179



<P>desperately, as if pursued for a murder.&nbsp; His



<P>face was drawn hard and tight with the stress of



<P>his endeavor.&nbsp; His eyes were fixed in a lurid



<P>glare.&nbsp; And with his soiled and disordered dress,



<P>his red and inflamed features surmounted by the



<P>dingy rag with its spot of blood, his wildly



<P>swinging rifle and banging accouterments, he



<P>looked to be an insane soldier.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As the regiment swung from its position out



<P>into a cleared space the woods and thickets be-



<P>fore it awakened.&nbsp; Yellow flames leaped toward



<P>it from many directions.&nbsp; The forest made a tre-



<P>mendous objection.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The line lurched straight for a moment.&nbsp; Then



<P>the right wing swung forward; it in turn was



<P>surpassed by the left.&nbsp; Afterward the center



<P>careered to the front until the regiment was a



<P>wedge-shaped mass, but an instant later the



<P>opposition of the bushes, trees, and uneven places



<P>on the ground split the command and scattered



<P>it into detached clusters.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth, light-footed, was unconsciously in



<P>advance.&nbsp; His eyes still kept note of the clump of



<P>trees.&nbsp; From all places near it the clannish yell



<P>of the enemy could be heard.&nbsp; The little flames



<P>of rifles leaped from it.&nbsp; The song of the bullets



<P>was in the air and shells snarled among the tree-



<P>tops.&nbsp; One tumbled directly into the middle of a



<P>hurrying group and exploded in crimson fury.



<P>There was an instant's spectacle of a man, almost



<P>over it, throwing up his hands to shield his eyes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Other men, punched by bullets, fell in gro-



<P>tesque agonies.&nbsp; The regiment left a coherent



<P>trail of bodies.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They had passed into a clearer atmosphere.



<P>There was an effect like a revelation in the new



<P>appearance of the landscape.&nbsp; Some men work-



<P>ing madly at a battery were plain to them, and



<P>the opposing infantry's lines were defined by the



<P>gray walls and fringes of smoke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It seemed to the youth that he saw every-



<P>thing.&nbsp; Each blade of the green grass was bold



<P>and clear.&nbsp; He thought that he was aware of



<P>every change in the thin, transparent vapor that



<P>floated idly in sheets.&nbsp; The brown or gray trunks



<P>of the trees showed each roughness of their sur-



<P>faces.&nbsp; And the men of the regiment, with their



<P>starting eyes and sweating faces, running madly,



<P>or falling, as if thrown headlong, to queer,



<P>heaped-up corpses--all were comprehended.&nbsp; His



<P>mind took a mechanical but firm impression, so



<P>that afterward everything was pictured and ex-



<P>plained to him, save why he himself was there.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But there was a frenzy made from this furious



<P>rush.&nbsp; The men, pitching forward insanely, had



<P>burst into cheerings, moblike and barbaric, but



<P>tuned in strange keys that can arouse the dullard



<P>and the stoic.&nbsp; It made a mad enthusiasm that, it



<P>seemed, would be incapable of checking itself



<P>before granite and brass.&nbsp; There was the deli-



<P>rium that encounters despair and death, and is



<P>heedless and blind to the odds.&nbsp; It is a temporary



<P>but sublime absence of selfishness.&nbsp; And because



<P>it was of this order was the reason, perhaps, why



<P>the youth wondered, afterward, what reasons he



<P>could have had for being there.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Presently the straining pace ate up the ener-



<P>gies of the men.&nbsp; As if by agreement, the leaders



<P>began to slacken their speed.&nbsp; The volleys di-



<P>rected against them had had a seeming windlike



<P>effect.&nbsp; The regiment snorted and blew.&nbsp; Among



<P>some stolid trees it began to falter and hesitate.



<P>The men, staring intently, began to wait for some



<P>of the distant walls of smoke to move and dis-



<P>close to them the scene.&nbsp; Since much of their



<P>strength and their breath had vanished, they re-



<P>turned to caution.&nbsp; They were become men



<P>again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth had a vague belief that he had run



<P>miles, and he thought, in a way, that he was now



<P>in some new and unknown land.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The moment the regiment ceased its advance



<P>the protesting splutter of musketry became a



<P>steadied roar.&nbsp; Long and accurate fringes of



<P>smoke spread out.&nbsp; From the top of a small hill



<P>came level belchings of yellow flame that caused



<P>an inhuman whistling in the air.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The men, halted, had opportunity to see some



<P>of their comrades dropping with moans and



<P>shrieks.&nbsp; A few lay under foot, still or wailing.



<P>And now for an instant the men stood, their rifles



<P>slack in their hands, and watched the regiment



<P>dwindle.&nbsp; They appeared dazed and stupid.&nbsp; This



<P>spectacle seemed to paralyze them, overcome



<P>them with a fatal fascination.&nbsp; They stared wood-



<P>enly at the sights, and, lowering their eyes, looked



<P>from face to face.&nbsp; It was a strange pause, and a



<P>strange silence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then, above the sounds of the outside commo-



<P>tion, arose the roar of the lieutenant.&nbsp; He strode



<P>suddenly forth, his infantile features black with



<P>rage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Come on, yeh fools!" he bellowed.&nbsp; "Come



<P>on!&nbsp; Yeh can't stay here.&nbsp; Yeh must come on."



<P>He said more, but much of it could not be under-



<P>stood.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He started rapidly forward, with his head



<P>turned toward the men.&nbsp; "Come on," he was



<P>shouting.&nbsp; The men stared with blank and yokel-



<P>like eyes at him.&nbsp; He was obliged to halt and



<P>retrace his steps.&nbsp; He stood then with his back



<P>to the enemy and delivered gigantic curses into



<P>the faces of the men.&nbsp; His body vibrated from



<P>the weight and force of his imprecations.&nbsp; And



<P>he could string oaths with the facility of a maiden



<P>who strings beads.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The friend of the youth aroused.&nbsp; Lurching



<P>suddenly forward and dropping to his knees, he



<P>fired an angry shot at the persistent woods.&nbsp; This



<P>action awakened the men.&nbsp; They huddled no



<P>more like sheep.&nbsp; They seemed suddenly to be-



<P>think them of their weapons, and at once com-



<P>menced firing.&nbsp; Belabored by their officers, they



<P>began to move forward.&nbsp; The regiment, involved



<P>like a cart involved in mud and muddle, started



<P>unevenly with many jolts and jerks.&nbsp; The men



<P>stopped now every few paces to fire and load,



<P>and in this manner moved slowly on from trees



<P>to trees.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The flaming opposition in their front grew



<P>with their advance until it seemed that all for-



<P>ward ways were barred by the thin leaping



<P>tongues, and off to the right an ominous demon-



<P>stration could sometimes be dimly discerned.



<P>The smoke lately generated was in confusing



<P>clouds that made it difficult for the regiment to



<P>proceed with intelligence.&nbsp; As he passed through



<P>each curling mass the youth wondered what



<P>would confront him on the farther side.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The command went painfully forward until an



<P>open space interposed between them and the



<P>lurid lines.&nbsp; Here, crouching and cowering be-



<P>hind some trees, the men clung with desperation,



<P>as if threatened by a wave.&nbsp; They looked wild-



<P>eyed, and as if amazed at this furious disturbance



<P>they had stirred.&nbsp; In the storm there was an



<P>ironical expression of their importance.&nbsp; The



<P>faces of the men, too, showed a lack of a certain



<P>feeling of responsibility for being there.&nbsp; It was



<P>as if they had been driven.&nbsp; It was the dominant



<P>animal failing to remember in the supreme mo-



<P>ments the forceful causes of various superficial



<P>qualities.&nbsp; The whole affair seemed incompre-



<P>hensible to many of them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As they halted thus the lieutenant again be-



<P>gan to bellow profanely.&nbsp; Regardless of the vin-



<P>dictive threats of the bullets, he went about



<P>coaxing, berating, and bedamning.&nbsp; His lips,



<P>that were habitually in a soft and childlike curve,



<P>were now writhed into unholy contortions.&nbsp; He



<P>swore by all possible deities.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Once he grabbed the youth by the arm.



<P>"Come on, yeh lunkhead!" he roared.&nbsp; "Come



<P>on!&nbsp; We'll all git killed if we stay here.&nbsp; We've



<P>on'y got t' go across that lot.&nbsp; An' then"--the



<P>remainder of his idea disappeared in a blue haze



<P>of curses.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth stretched forth his arm.&nbsp; "Cross



<P>there?"&nbsp; His mouth was puckered in doubt and



<P>awe.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Certainly.&nbsp; Jest 'cross th' lot!&nbsp; We can't



<P>stay here," screamed the lieutenant.&nbsp; He poked



<P>his face close to the youth and waved his ban-



<P>daged hand.&nbsp; "Come on!"&nbsp; Presently he grap-



<P>pled with him as if for a wrestling bout.&nbsp; It was



<P>as if he planned to drag the youth by the ear on



<P>to the assault.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The private felt a sudden unspeakable indig-



<P>nation against his officer.&nbsp; He wrenched fiercely



<P>and shook him off.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Come on herself, then," he yelled.&nbsp; There



<P>was a bitter challenge in his voice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They galloped together down the regimental



<P>front.&nbsp; The friend scrambled after them.&nbsp; In front



<P>of the colors the three men began to bawl:



<P>"Come on! come on!"&nbsp; They danced and gy-



<P>rated like tortured savages.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The flag, obedient to these appeals, bended its



<P>glittering form and swept toward them.&nbsp; The



<P>men wavered in indecision for a moment, and then



<P>with a long, wailful cry the dilapidated regiment



<P>surged forward and began its new journey.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Over the field went the scurrying mass.&nbsp; It



<P>was a handful of men splattered into the faces of



<P>the enemy.&nbsp; Toward it instantly sprang the yel-



<P>low tongues.&nbsp; A vast quantity of blue smoke



<P>hung before them.&nbsp; A mighty banging made ears



<P>valueless.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth ran like a madman to reach the



<P>woods before a bullet could discover him.&nbsp; He



<P>ducked his head low, like a football player.&nbsp; In



<P>his haste his eyes almost closed, and the scene was



<P>a wild blur.&nbsp; Pulsating saliva stood at the corners



<P>of his mouth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Within him, as he hurled himself forward, was



<P>born a love, a despairing fondness for this flag



<P>which was near him.&nbsp; It was a creation of beauty



<P>and invulnerability.&nbsp; It was a goddess, radiant,



<P>that bended its form with an imperious gesture to



<P>him.&nbsp; It was a woman, red and white, hating and



<P>loving, that called him with the voice of his



<P>hopes.&nbsp; Because no harm could come to it he en-



<P>dowed it with power.&nbsp; He kept near, as if it



<P>could be a saver of lives, and an imploring cry



<P>went from his mind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the mad scramble he was aware that the



<P>color sergeant flinched suddenly, as if struck by a



<P>bludgeon.&nbsp; He faltered, and then became motion-



<P>less, save for his quivering knees.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He made a spring and a clutch at the pole.



<P>At the same instant his friend grabbed it from the



<P>other side.&nbsp; They jerked at it, stout and furious,



<P>but the color sergeant was dead, and the corpse



<P>would not relinquish its trust.&nbsp; For a moment



<P>there was a grim encounter.&nbsp; The dead man,



<P>swinging with bended back, seemed to be obsti-



<P>nately tugging, in ludicrous and awful ways, for



<P>the possession of the flag.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was past in an instant of time.&nbsp; They



<P>wrenched the flag furiously from the dead man,



<P>and, as they turned again, the corpse swayed for-



<P>ward with bowed head.&nbsp; One arm swung high,



<P>and the curved hand fell with heavy protest on



<P>the friend's unheeding shoulder.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>THE ragged line had respite for some min-



<P>utes, but during its pause the struggle in the



<P>forest became magnified until the trees seemed to



<P>quiver from the firing and the ground to shake



<P>from the rushing of the men.&nbsp; The voices of the



<P>cannon were mingled in a long and interminable



<P>row.&nbsp; It seemed difficult to live in such an atmos-



<P>phere.&nbsp; The chests of the men strained for a bit



<P>of freshness, and their throats craved water.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was one shot through the body, who



<P>raised a cry of bitter lamentation when came this



<P>lull.&nbsp; Perhaps he had been calling out during



<P>the fighting also, but at that time no one had



<P>heard him.&nbsp; But now the men turned at the woe-



<P>ful complaints of him upon the ground.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Who is it?&nbsp; Who is it?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's Jimmie Rogers.&nbsp; Jimmie Rogers."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When their eyes first encountered him there



<P>was a sudden halt, as if they feared to go near.



<P>He was thrashing about in the grass, twisting his

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>171



<P>shuddering body into many strange postures.



<P>He was screaming loudly.&nbsp; This instant's hesita-



<P>tion seemed to fill him with a tremendous, fantas-



<P>tic contempt, and he damned them in shrieked



<P>sentences.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth's friend had a geographical illusion



<P>concerning a stream, and he obtained permission



<P>to go for some water.&nbsp; Immediately canteens



<P>were showered upon him.&nbsp; "Fill mine, will



<P>yeh?"&nbsp; "Bring me some, too."&nbsp; "And me, too."



<P>He departed, ladened.&nbsp; The youth went with his



<P>friend, feeling a desire to throw his heated body



<P>onto the stream and, soaking there, drink quarts.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They made a hurried search for the supposed



<P>stream, but did not find it.&nbsp; "No water here,"



<P>said the youth.&nbsp; They turned without delay and



<P>began to retrace their steps.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>From their position as they again faced to-



<P>ward the place of the fighting, they could of



<P>course comprehend a greater amount of the bat-



<P>tle than when their visions had been blurred by



<P>the hurling smoke of the line.&nbsp; They could see



<P>dark stretches winding along the land, and on



<P>one cleared space there was a row of guns mak-



<P>ing gray clouds, which were filled with large



<P>flashes of orange-colored flame.&nbsp; Over some foli-



<P>age they could see the roof of a house.&nbsp; One win-



<P>dow, glowing a deep murder red, shone squarely



<P>through the leaves.&nbsp; From the edifice a tall lean-



<P>ing tower of smoke went far into the sky.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Looking over their own troops, they saw



<P>mixed masses slowly getting into regular form.



<P>The sunlight made twinkling points of the bright



<P>steel.&nbsp; To the rear there was a glimpse of a dis-



<P>tant roadway as it curved over a slope.&nbsp; It was



<P>crowded with retreating infantry.&nbsp; From all the



<P>interwoven forest arose the smoke and bluster



<P>of the battle.&nbsp; The air was always occupied by



<P>a blaring.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Near where they stood shells were flip-flap-



<P>ping and hooting.&nbsp; Occasional bullets buzzed in



<P>the air and spanged into tree trunks.&nbsp; Wounded



<P>men and other stragglers were slinking through



<P>the woods.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Looking down an aisle of the grove, the



<P>youth and his companion saw a jangling general



<P>and his staff almost ride upon a wounded man,



<P>who was crawling on his hands and knees.&nbsp; The



<P>general reined strongly at his charger's opened



<P>and foamy mouth and guided it with dexterous



<P>horsemanship past the man.&nbsp; The latter scram-



<P>bled in wild and torturing haste.&nbsp; His strength



<P>evidently failed him as he reached a place of



<P>safety.&nbsp; One of his arms suddenly weakened, and



<P>he fell, sliding over upon his back.&nbsp; He lay



<P>stretched out, breathing gently.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A moment later the small, creaking cavalcade



<P>was directly in front of the two soldiers.&nbsp; An-



<P>other officer, riding with the skillful abandon of a



<P>cowboy, galloped his horse to a position directly



<P>before the general.&nbsp; The two unnoticed foot sol-



<P>diers made a little show of going on, but they



<P>lingered near in the desire to overhear the con-



<P>versation.&nbsp; Perhaps, they thought, some great



<P>inner historical things would be said.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The general, whom the boys knew as the com-



<P>mander of their division, looked at the other



<P>officer and spoke coolly, as if he were criticising



<P>his clothes.&nbsp; "Th' enemy's formin' over there for



<P>another charge," he said.&nbsp; "It'll be directed



<P>against Whiterside, an' I fear they'll break



<P>through there unless we work like thunder t' stop



<P>them."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The other swore at his restive horse, and then



<P>cleared his throat.&nbsp; He made a gesture toward



<P>his cap.&nbsp; "It'll be hell t' pay stoppin' them," he



<P>said shortly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I presume so," remarked the general.&nbsp; Then



<P>he began to talk rapidly and in a lower tone.&nbsp; He



<P>frequently illustrated his words with a pointing



<P>finger.&nbsp; The two infantrymen could hear nothing



<P>until finally he asked: "What troops can you



<P>spare?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The officer who rode like a cowboy reflected



<P>for an instant.&nbsp; "Well," he said, "I had to order



<P>in th' 12th to help th' 76th, an' I haven't really got



<P>any.&nbsp; But there's th' 304th.&nbsp; They fight like a



<P>lot 'a mule drivers.&nbsp; I can spare them best



<P>of any."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth and his friend exchanged glances



<P>of astonishment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The general spoke sharply.&nbsp; "Get 'em ready,



<P>then.&nbsp; I'll watch developments from here, an'



<P>send you word when t' start them.&nbsp; It'll happen



<P>in five minutes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As the other officer tossed his fingers toward



<P>his cap and wheeling his horse, started away, the



<P>general called out to him in a sober voice: "I



<P>don't believe many of your mule drivers will get



<P>back."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The other shouted something in reply.&nbsp; He



<P>smiled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With scared faces, the youth and his compan-



<P>ion hurried back to the line.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These happenings had occupied an incredibly



<P>short time, yet the youth felt that in them he had



<P>been made aged.&nbsp; New eyes were given to him.



<P>And the most startling thing was to learn sud-



<P>denly that he was very insignificant.&nbsp; The officer



<P>spoke of the regiment as if he referred to a



<P>broom.&nbsp; Some part of the woods needed sweep-



<P>ing, perhaps, and he merely indicated a broom in



<P>a tone properly indifferent to its fate.&nbsp; It was



<P>war, no doubt, but it appeared strange.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As the two boys approached the line, the lieu-



<P>tenant perceived them and swelled with wrath.



<P>"Fleming--Wilson--how long does it take yeh



<P>to git water, anyhow--where yeh been to."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But his oration ceased as he saw their eyes,



<P>which were large with great tales.&nbsp; "We're goin'



<P>t' charge--we're goin' t' charge!" cried the



<P>youth's friend, hastening with his news.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Charge?" said the lieutenant.&nbsp; "Charge?



<P>Well, b'Gawd!&nbsp; Now, this is real fightin'."&nbsp; Over



<P>his soiled countenance there went a boastful



<P>smile.&nbsp; "Charge?&nbsp; Well, b'Gawd!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A little group of soldiers surrounded the two



<P>youths.&nbsp; "Are we, sure 'nough?&nbsp; Well, I'll be



<P>derned!&nbsp; Charge?&nbsp; What fer?&nbsp; What at?&nbsp; Wil-



<P>son, you're lyin'."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I hope to die," said the youth, pitching his



<P>tones to the key of angry remonstrance.&nbsp; "Sure



<P>as shooting, I tell you."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And his friend spoke in re-enforcement.&nbsp; "Not



<P>by a blame sight, he ain't lyin'.&nbsp; We heard 'em



<P>talkin'."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They caught sight of two mounted figures a



<P>short distance from them.&nbsp; One was the colonel



<P>of the regiment and the other was the officer who



<P>had received orders from the commander of the



<P>division.&nbsp; They were gesticulating at each other.



<P>The soldier, pointing at them, interpreted the



<P>scene.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One man had a final objection: "How could



<P>yeh hear 'em talkin'?"&nbsp; But the men, for a large



<P>part, nodded, admitting that previously the two



<P>friends had spoken truth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They settled back into reposeful attitudes



<P>with airs of having accepted the matter.&nbsp; And



<P>they mused upon it, with a hundred varieties of



<P>expression.&nbsp; It was an engrossing thing to think



<P>about.&nbsp; Many tightened their belts carefully and



<P>hitched at their trousers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A moment later the officers began to bustle



<P>among the men, pushing them into a more com-



<P>pact mass and into a better alignment.&nbsp; They



<P>chased those that straggled and fumed at a few



<P>men who seemed to show by their attitudes that



<P>they had decided to remain at that spot.&nbsp; They



<P>were like critical shepherds struggling with sheep.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Presently, the regiment seemed to draw itself



<P>up and heave a deep breath.&nbsp; None of the men's



<P>faces were mirrors of large thoughts.&nbsp; The sol-



<P>diers were bended and stooped like sprinters be-



<P>fore a signal.&nbsp; Many pairs of glinting eyes peered



<P>from the grimy faces toward the curtains of the



<P>deeper woods.&nbsp; They seemed to be engaged in



<P>deep calculations of time and distance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They were surrounded by the noises of the



<P>monstrous altercation between the two armies.



<P>The world was fully interested in other matters.



<P>Apparently, the regiment had its small affair to



<P>itself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth, turning, shot a quick, inquiring



<P>glance at his friend.&nbsp; The latter returned to him



<P>the same manner of look.&nbsp; They were the only



<P>ones who possessed an inner knowledge.&nbsp; "Mule



<P>drivers--hell t' pay--don't believe many will get



<P>back."&nbsp; It was an ironical secret.&nbsp; Still, they saw



<P>no hesitation in each other's faces, and they nod-



<P>ded a mute and unprotesting assent when a shag-



<P>gy man near them said in a meek voice: "We'll



<P>git swallowed."

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>THE roarings that had stretched in a long line



<P>of sound across the face of the forest began to



<P>grow intermittent and weaker.&nbsp; The stentorian



<P>speeches of the artillery continued in some dis-



<P>tant encounter, but the crashes of the musketry



<P>had almost ceased.&nbsp; The youth and his friend of



<P>a sudden looked up, feeling a deadened form of



<P>distress at the waning of these noises, which had



<P>become a part of life.&nbsp; They could see changes



<P>going on among the troops.&nbsp; There were march-



<P>ings this way and that way.&nbsp; A battery wheeled



<P>leisurely.&nbsp; On the crest of a small hill was the



<P>thick gleam of many departing muskets.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth arose.&nbsp; "Well, what now, I won-



<P>der?" he said.&nbsp; By his tone he seemed to be



<P>preparing to resent some new monstrosity in



<P>the way of dins and smashes.&nbsp; He shaded his



<P>eyes with his grimy hand and gazed over the



<P>field.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His friend also arose and stared.&nbsp; "I bet

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>226



<P>we're goin' t' git along out of this an' back over



<P>th' river," said he.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I swan!" said the youth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They waited, watching.&nbsp; Within a little while



<P>the regiment received orders to retrace its way.



<P>The men got up grunting from the grass, regret-



<P>ting the soft repose.&nbsp; They jerked their stiffened



<P>legs, and stretched their arms over their heads.



<P>One man swore as he rubbed his eyes.&nbsp; They all



<P>groaned "O Lord!"&nbsp; They had as many objec-



<P>tions to this change as they would have had to a



<P>proposal for a new battle.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They trampled slowly back over the field



<P>across which they had run in a mad scamper.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The regiment marched until it had joined its



<P>fellows.&nbsp; The reformed brigade, in column, aimed



<P>through a wood at the road.&nbsp; Directly they were



<P>in a mass of dust-covered troops, and were



<P>trudging along in a way parallel to the enemy's



<P>lines as these had been defined by the previous



<P>turmoil.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They passed within view of a stolid white



<P>house, and saw in front of it groups of their com-



<P>rades lying in wait behind a neat breastwork.&nbsp; A



<P>row of guns were booming at a distant enemy.



<P>Shells thrown in reply were raising clouds of



<P>dust and splinters.&nbsp; Horsemen dashed along the



<P>line of intrenchments.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At this point of its march the division curved



<P>away from the field and went winding off in the



<P>direction of the river.&nbsp; When the significance of



<P>this movement had impressed itself upon the



<P>youth he turned his head and looked over his



<P>shoulder toward the trampled and debris-strewed



<P>ground.&nbsp; He breathed a breath of new satisfac-



<P>tion.&nbsp; He finally nudged his friend.&nbsp; "Well, it's



<P>all over," he said to him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His friend gazed backward.&nbsp; "B'Gawd, it



<P>is," he assented.&nbsp; They mused.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For a time the youth was obliged to reflect



<P>in a puzzled and uncertain way.&nbsp; His mind was



<P>undergoing a subtle change.&nbsp; It took moments



<P>for it to cast off its battleful ways and resume



<P>its accustomed course of thought.&nbsp; Gradually his



<P>brain emerged from the clogged clouds, and at



<P>last he was enabled to more closely compre-



<P>hend himself and circumstance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He understood then that the existence of shot



<P>and counter-shot was in the past.&nbsp; He had dwelt



<P>in a land of strange, squalling upheavals and had



<P>come forth.&nbsp; He had been where there was red



<P>of blood and black of passion, and he was es-



<P>caped.&nbsp; His first thoughts were given to rejoic-



<P>ings at this fact.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Later he began to study his deeds, his fail-



<P>ures, and his achievements.&nbsp; Thus, fresh from



<P>scenes where many of his usual machines of re-



<P>flection had been idle, from where he had pro-



<P>ceeded sheeplike, he struggled to marshal all his



<P>acts.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At last they marched before him clearly.



<P>From this present view point he was enabled



<P>to look upon them in spectator fashion and



<P>to criticise them with some correctness, for his



<P>new condition had already defeated certain sym-



<P>pathies.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Regarding his procession of memory he felt



<P>gleeful and unregretting, for in it his public deeds



<P>were paraded in great and shining prominence.



<P>Those performances which had been witnessed



<P>by his fellows marched now in wide purple and



<P>gold, having various deflections.&nbsp; They went



<P>gayly with music.&nbsp; It was pleasure to watch these



<P>things.&nbsp; He spent delightful minutes viewing the



<P>gilded images of memory.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He saw that he was good.&nbsp; He recalled with



<P>a thrill of joy the respectful comments of his fel-



<P>lows upon his conduct.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nevertheless, the ghost of his flight from



<P>the first engagement appeared to him and



<P>danced.&nbsp; There were small shoutings in his



<P>brain about these matters.&nbsp; For a moment he



<P>blushed, and the light of his soul flickered with



<P>shame.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A specter of reproach came to him.&nbsp; There



<P>loomed the dogging memory of the tattered



<P>soldier--he who, gored by bullets and faint for



<P>blood, had fretted concerning an imagined wound



<P>in another; he who had loaned his last of strength



<P>and intellect for the tall soldier; he who, blind



<P>with weariness and pain, had been deserted in



<P>the field.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For an instant a wretched chill of sweat was



<P>upon him at the thought that he might be



<P>detected in the thing.&nbsp; As he stood persistently



<P>before his vision, he gave vent to a cry of sharp



<P>irritation and agony.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His friend turned.&nbsp; "What's the matter,



<P>Henry?" he demanded.&nbsp; The youth's reply was



<P>an outburst of crimson oaths.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As he marched along the little branch-hung



<P>roadway among his prattling companions this



<P>vision of cruelty brooded over him.&nbsp; It clung



<P>near him always and darkened his view of these



<P>deeds in purple and gold.&nbsp; Whichever way his



<P>thoughts turned they were followed by the



<P>somber phantom of the desertion in the fields.



<P>He looked stealthily at his companions, feeling



<P>sure that they must discern in his face evidences



<P>of this pursuit.&nbsp; But they were plodding in



<P>ragged array, discussing with quick tongues the



<P>accomplishments of the late battle.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, if a man should come up an' ask me, I'd



<P>say we got a dum good lickin'."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Lickin'--in yer eye!&nbsp; We ain't licked, sonny.



<P>We're goin' down here aways, swing aroun', an'



<P>come in behint 'em."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, hush, with your comin' in behint 'em.



<P>I've seen all 'a that I wanta.&nbsp; Don't tell me about



<P>comin' in behint--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Bill Smithers, he ses he'd rather been in



<P>ten hundred battles than been in that heluva



<P>hospital.&nbsp; He ses they got shootin' in th' night-



<P>time, an' shells dropped plum among 'em in th'



<P>hospital.&nbsp; He ses sech hollerin' he never see."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hasbrouck?&nbsp; He's th' best off'cer in this



<P>here reg'ment.&nbsp; He's a whale."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Didn't I tell yeh we'd come aroun' in behint



<P>'em?&nbsp; Didn't I tell yeh so?&nbsp; We--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, shet yeh mouth!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For a time this pursuing recollection of the



<P>tattered man took all elation from the youth's



<P>veins.&nbsp; He saw his vivid error, and he was afraid



<P>that it would stand before him all his life.&nbsp; He



<P>took no share in the chatter of his comrades, nor



<P>did he look at them or know them, save when he



<P>felt sudden suspicion that they were seeing his



<P>thoughts and scrutinizing each detail of the scene



<P>with the tattered soldier.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Yet gradually he mustered force to put the sin



<P>at a distance.&nbsp; And at last his eyes seemed to



<P>open to some new ways.&nbsp; He found that he could



<P>look back upon the brass and bombast of his



<P>earlier gospels and see them truly.&nbsp; He was



<P>gleeful when he discovered that he now despised



<P>them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>With this conviction came a store of assur-



<P>ance.&nbsp; He felt a quiet manhood, nonassertive but



<P>of sturdy and strong blood.&nbsp; He knew that he



<P>would no more quail before his guides wher-



<P>ever they should point.&nbsp; He had been to touch



<P>the great death, and found that, after all, it was



<P>but the great death.&nbsp; He was a man.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So it came to pass that as he trudged from



<P>the place of blood and wrath his soul changed.



<P>He came from hot plowshares to prospects of



<P>clover tranquilly, and it was as if hot plowshares



<P>were not.&nbsp; Scars faded as flowers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It rained.&nbsp; The procession of weary soldiers



<P>became a bedraggled train, despondent and



<P>muttering, marching with churning effort in a



<P>trough of liquid brown mud under a low,



<P>wretched sky.&nbsp; Yet the youth smiled, for he saw



<P>that the world was a world for him, though many



<P>discovered it to be made of oaths and walking



<P>sticks.&nbsp; He had rid himself of the red sickness of



<P>battle.&nbsp; The sultry nightmare was in the past.



<P>He had been an animal blistered and sweating in



<P>the heat and pain of war.&nbsp; He turned now with a



<P>lover's thirst to images of tranquil skies, fresh



<P>meadows, cool brooks--an existence of soft and



<P>eternal peace.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Over the river a golden ray of sun came



<P>through the hosts of leaden rain clouds.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>THE trees began softly to sing a hymn of twi-



<P>light.&nbsp; The sun sank until slanted bronze rays



<P>struck the forest.&nbsp; There was a lull in the noises



<P>of insects as if they had bowed their beaks and



<P>were making a devotional pause.&nbsp; There was



<P>silence save for the chanted chorus of the trees.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then, upon this stillness, there suddenly broke



<P>a tremendous clangor of sounds.&nbsp; A crimson roar



<P>came from the distance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth stopped.&nbsp; He was transfixed by



<P>this terrific medley of all noises.&nbsp; It was as if



<P>worlds were being rended.&nbsp; There was the rip-



<P>ping sound of musketry and the breaking crash



<P>of the artillery.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His mind flew in all directions.&nbsp; He conceived



<P>the two armies to be at each other panther



<P>fashion.&nbsp; He listened for a time.&nbsp; Then he began



<P>to run in the direction of the battle.&nbsp; He saw



<P>that it was an ironical thing for him to be run-



<P>ning thus toward that which he had been at such



<P>pains to avoid.&nbsp; But he said, in substance, to him-



<P>self that if the earth and the moon were about to



<P>clash, many persons would doubtless plan to get



<P>upon the roofs to witness the collision.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As he ran, he became aware that the forest



<P>had stopped its music, as if at last becoming



<P>capable of hearing the foreign sounds.&nbsp; The trees



<P>hushed and stood motionless.&nbsp; Everything seemed



<P>to be listening to the crackle and clatter and ear-



<P>shaking thunder.&nbsp; The chorus pealed over the



<P>still earth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It suddenly occurred to the youth that the



<P>fight in which he had been was, after all, but



<P>perfunctory popping.&nbsp; In the hearing of this



<P>present din he was doubtful if he had seen real



<P>battle scenes.&nbsp; This uproar explained a celes-



<P>tial battle; it was tumbling hordes a-struggle in



<P>the air.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Reflecting, he saw a sort of a humor in the



<P>point of view of himself and his fellows during



<P>the late encounter.&nbsp; They had taken themselves



<P>and the enemy very seriously and had imagined



<P>that they were deciding the war.&nbsp; Individuals



<P>must have supposed that they were cutting the



<P>letters of their names deep into everlasting tablets



<P>of brass, or enshrining their reputations forever in



<P>the hearts of their countrymen, while, as to fact,



<P>the affair would appear in printed reports under a



<P>meek and immaterial title.&nbsp; But he saw that it was



<P>good, else, he said, in battle every one would



<P>surely run save forlorn hopes and their ilk.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He went rapidly on.&nbsp; He wished to come to



<P>the edge of the forest that he might peer out.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As he hastened, there passed through his mind



<P>pictures of stupendous conflicts.&nbsp; His accumulated



<P>thought upon such subjects was used to form



<P>scenes.&nbsp; The noise was as the voice of an eloquent



<P>being, describing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sometimes the brambles formed chains and



<P>tried to hold him back.&nbsp; Trees, confronting him,



<P>stretched out their arms and forbade him to pass.



<P>After its previous hostility this new resistance of



<P>the forest filled him with a fine bitterness.&nbsp; It



<P>seemed that Nature could not be quite ready to



<P>kill him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But he obstinately took roundabout ways, and



<P>presently he was where he could see long gray



<P>walls of vapor where lay battle lines.&nbsp; The voices



<P>of cannon shook him.&nbsp; The musketry sounded in



<P>long irregular surges that played havoc with his



<P>ears.&nbsp; He stood regardant for a moment.&nbsp; His



<P>eyes had an awestruck expression.&nbsp; He gawked



<P>in the direction of the fight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Presently he proceeded again on his forward



<P>way.&nbsp; The battle was like the grinding of an



<P>immense and terrible machine to him.&nbsp; Its com-



<P>plexities and powers, its grim processes, fascinated



<P>him.&nbsp; He must go close and see it produce



<P>corpses.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He came to a fence and clambered over it.



<P>On the far side, the ground was littered with



<P>clothes and guns.&nbsp; A newspaper, folded up, lay



<P>in the dirt.&nbsp; A dead soldier was stretched with



<P>his face hidden in his arm.&nbsp; Farther off there



<P>was a group of four or five corpses keeping



<P>mournful company.&nbsp; A hot sun had blazed upon



<P>the spot.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In this place the youth felt that he was an



<P>invader.&nbsp; This forgotten part of the battle ground



<P>was owned by the dead men, and he hurried, in



<P>the vague apprehension that one of the swollen



<P>forms would rise and tell him to begone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He came finally to a road from which he



<P>could see in the distance dark and agitated



<P>bodies of troops, smoke-fringed.&nbsp; In the lane



<P>was a blood-stained crowd streaming to the rear.



<P>The wounded men were cursing, groaning, and



<P>wailing.&nbsp; In the air, always, was a mighty swell



<P>of sound that it seemed could sway the earth.



<P>With the courageous words of the artillery and



<P>the spiteful sentences of the musketry mingled



<P>red cheers.&nbsp; And from this region of noises came



<P>the steady current of the maimed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One of the wounded men had a shoeful of



<P>blood.&nbsp; He hopped like a schoolboy in a game.



<P>He was laughing hysterically.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One was swearing that he had been shot in the



<P>arm through the commanding general's misman-



<P>agement of the army.&nbsp; One was marching with



<P>an air imitative of some sublime drum major.



<P>Upon his features was an unholy mixture of



<P>merriment and agony.&nbsp; As he marched he sang



<P>a bit of doggerel in a high and quavering voice:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sing a song 'a vic'try,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A pocketful 'a bullets,



<P>Five an' twenty dead men



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Baked in a--pie."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Parts of the procession limped and staggered to



<P>this tune.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Another had the gray seal of death already



<P>upon his face.&nbsp; His lips were curled in hard lines



<P>and his teeth were clinched.&nbsp; His hands were



<P>bloody from where he had pressed them upon his



<P>wound.&nbsp; He seemed to be awaiting the moment



<P>when he should pitch headlong.&nbsp; He stalked like



<P>the specter of a soldier, his eyes burning with the



<P>power of a stare into the unknown.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There were some who proceeded sullenly, full



<P>of anger at their wounds, and ready to turn upon



<P>anything as an obscure cause.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>An officer was carried along by two privates.



<P>He was peevish.&nbsp; "Don't joggle so, Johnson, yeh



<P>fool," he cried.&nbsp; "Think m' leg is made of iron?



<P>If yeh can't carry me decent, put me down an'



<P>let some one else do it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He bellowed at the tottering crowd who



<P>blocked the quick march of his bearers.&nbsp; "Say,



<P>make way there, can't yeh?&nbsp; Make way, dickens



<P>take it all."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They sulkily parted and went to the road-



<P>sides.&nbsp; As he was carried past they made pert



<P>remarks to him.&nbsp; When he raged in reply and



<P>threatened them, they told him to be damned.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The shoulder of one of the tramping bearers



<P>knocked heavily against the spectral soldier who



<P>was staring into the unknown.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth joined this crowd and marched



<P>along with it.&nbsp; The torn bodies expressed the



<P>awful machinery in which the men had been



<P>entangled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Orderlies and couriers occasionally broke



<P>through the throng in the roadway, scattering



<P>wounded men right and left, galloping on fol-



<P>lowed by howls.&nbsp; The melancholy march was



<P>continually disturbed by the messengers, and



<P>sometimes by bustling batteries that came swing-



<P>ing and thumping down upon them, the officers



<P>shouting orders to clear the way.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a tattered man, fouled with dust,



<P>blood and powder stain from hair to shoes, who



<P>trudged quietly at the youth's side.&nbsp; He was lis-



<P>tening with eagerness and much humility to the



<P>lurid descriptions of a bearded sergeant.&nbsp; His



<P>lean features wore an expression of awe and ad-



<P>miration.&nbsp; He was like a listener in a country



<P>store to wondrous tales told among the sugar



<P>barrels.&nbsp; He eyed the story-teller with unspeak-



<P>able wonder.&nbsp; His mouth was agape in yokel



<P>fashion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The sergeant, taking note of this, gave pause



<P>to his elaborate history while he administered a



<P>sardonic comment.&nbsp; "Be keerful, honey, you 'll



<P>be a-ketchin' flies," he said.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The tattered man shrank back abashed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a time he began to sidle near to the



<P>youth, and in a different way try to make him a



<P>friend.&nbsp; His voice was gentle as a girl's voice



<P>and his eyes were pleading.&nbsp; The youth saw



<P>with surprise that the soldier had two wounds,



<P>one in the head, bound with a blood-soaked rag,



<P>and the other in the arm, making that member



<P>dangle like a broken bough.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After they had walked together for some time



<P>the tattered man mustered sufficient courage to



<P>speak.&nbsp; "Was pretty good fight, wa'n't it?"



<P>he timidly said.&nbsp; The youth, deep in thought,



<P>glanced up at the bloody and grim figure with



<P>its lamblike eyes.&nbsp; "What?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Was pretty good fight, wa'n't it?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes," said the youth shortly.&nbsp; He quick-



<P>ened his pace.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But the other hobbled industriously after him.



<P>There was an air of apology in his manner, but



<P>he evidently thought that he needed only to talk



<P>for a time, and the youth would perceive that he



<P>was a good fellow.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Was pretty good fight, wa'n't it?" he began



<P>in a small voice, and then he achieved the forti-



<P>tude to continue.&nbsp; "Dern me if I ever see fellers



<P>fight so.&nbsp; Laws, how they did fight!&nbsp; I knowed



<P>th' boys 'd like when they onct got square at it.



<P>Th' boys ain't had no fair chanct up t' now, but



<P>this time they showed what they was.&nbsp; I knowed



<P>it 'd turn out this way.&nbsp; Yeh can't lick them boys.



<P>No, sir!&nbsp; They're fighters, they be."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He breathed a deep breath of humble ad-



<P>miration.&nbsp; He had looked at the youth for en-



<P>couragement several times.&nbsp; He received none,



<P>but gradually he seemed to get absorbed in his



<P>subject.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was talkin' 'cross pickets with a boy from



<P>Georgie, onct, an' that boy, he ses, 'Your fellers



<P>'ll all run like hell when they onct hearn a gun,'



<P>he ses.&nbsp; 'Mebbe they will,' I ses, 'but I don't



<P>b'lieve none of it,' I ses; 'an' b'jiminey,' I ses back



<P>t' 'um, 'mebbe your fellers 'll all run like hell



<P>when they onct hearn a gun,' I ses.&nbsp; He larfed.



<P>Well, they didn't run t' day, did they, hey?&nbsp; No,



<P>sir!&nbsp; They fit, an' fit, an' fit."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His homely face was suffused with a light of



<P>love for the army which was to him all things



<P>beautiful and powerful.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a time he turned to the youth.&nbsp; "Where



<P>yeh hit, ol' boy?" he asked in a brotherly tone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth felt instant panic at this question,



<P>although at first its full import was not borne in



<P>upon him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What?" he asked.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Where yeh hit?" repeated the tattered man.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why," began the youth, "I--I--that is--



<P>why--I--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He turned away suddenly and slid through



<P>the crowd.&nbsp; His brow was heavily flushed, and



<P>his fingers were picking nervously at one of his



<P>buttons.&nbsp; He bent his head and fastened his eyes



<P>studiously upon the button as if it were a little



<P>problem.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The tattered man looked after him in astonishment.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>WHEN the two youths turned with the flag



<P>they saw that much of the regiment had crum-



<P>bled away, and the dejected remnant was coming



<P>slowly back.&nbsp; The men, having hurled themselves



<P>in projectile fashion, had presently expended their



<P>forces.&nbsp; They slowly retreated, with their faces



<P>still toward the spluttering woods, and their hot



<P>rifles still replying to the din.&nbsp; Several officers



<P>were giving orders, their voices keyed to screams.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Where in hell yeh goin'?" the lieutenant was



<P>asking in a sarcastic howl.&nbsp; And a red-bearded



<P>officer, whose voice of triple brass could plainly



<P>be heard, was commanding: "Shoot into 'em!



<P>Shoot into 'em, Gawd damn their souls!"&nbsp; There



<P>was a melee of screeches, in which the men were



<P>ordered to do conflicting and impossible things.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth and his friend had a small scuffle



<P>over the flag.&nbsp; "Give it t' me!"&nbsp; "No, let me



<P>keep it!"&nbsp; Each felt satisfied with the other's pos-



<P>session of it, but each felt bound to declare, by

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>189



<P>an offer to carry the emblem, his willingness to



<P>further risk himself.&nbsp; The youth roughly pushed



<P>his friend away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The regiment fell back to the stolid trees.



<P>There it halted for a moment to blaze at some



<P>dark forms that had begun to steal upon its track.



<P>Presently it resumed its march again, curving



<P>among the tree trunks.&nbsp; By the time the depleted



<P>regiment had again reached the first open space



<P>they were receiving a fast and merciless fire.



<P>There seemed to be mobs all about them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The greater part of the men, discouraged,



<P>their spirits worn by the turmoil, acted as if



<P>stunned.&nbsp; They accepted the pelting of the bul-



<P>lets with bowed and weary heads.&nbsp; It was of no



<P>purpose to strive against walls.&nbsp; It was of no use



<P>to batter themselves against granite.&nbsp; And from



<P>this consciousness that they had attempted to



<P>conquer an unconquerable thing there seemed



<P>to arise a feeling that they had been betrayed.



<P>They glowered with bent brows, but danger-



<P>ously, upon some of the officers, more particu-



<P>larly upon the red-bearded one with the voice of



<P>triple brass.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>However, the rear of the regiment was fringed



<P>with men, who continued to shoot irritably at the



<P>advancing foes.&nbsp; They seemed resolved to make



<P>every trouble.&nbsp; The youthful lieutenant was per-



<P>haps the last man in the disordered mass.&nbsp; His



<P>forgotten back was toward the enemy.&nbsp; He had



<P>been shot in the arm.&nbsp; It hung straight and rigid.



<P>Occasionally he would cease to remember it, and



<P>be about to emphasize an oath with a sweeping



<P>gesture.&nbsp; The multiplied pain caused him to



<P>swear with incredible power.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth went along with slipping, uncertain



<P>feet.&nbsp; He kept watchful eyes rearward.&nbsp; A scowl



<P>of mortification and rage was upon his face.&nbsp; He



<P>had thought of a fine revenge upon the officer



<P>who had referred to him and his fellows as mule



<P>drivers.&nbsp; But he saw that it could not come to



<P>pass.&nbsp; His dreams had collapsed when the mule



<P>drivers, dwindling rapidly, had wavered and hes-



<P>itated on the little clearing, and then had recoiled.



<P>And now the retreat of the mule drivers was a



<P>march of shame to him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A dagger-pointed gaze from without his black-



<P>ened face was held toward the enemy, but his



<P>greater hatred was riveted upon the man, who,



<P>not knowing him, had called him a mule driver.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When he knew that he and his comrades had



<P>failed to do anything in successful ways that might



<P>bring the little pangs of a kind of remorse upon



<P>the officer, the youth allowed the rage of the baf-



<P>fled to possess him.&nbsp; This cold officer upon a



<P>monument, who dropped epithets unconcernedly



<P>down, would be finer as a dead man, he thought.



<P>So grievous did he think it that he could



<P>never possess the secret right to taunt truly in



<P>answer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had pictured red letters of curious revenge.



<P>"We ARE mule drivers, are we?"&nbsp; And now he



<P>was compelled to throw them away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He presently wrapped his heart in the cloak



<P>of his pride and kept the flag erect.&nbsp; He ha-



<P>rangued his fellows, pushing against their chests



<P>with his free hand.&nbsp; To those he knew well he



<P>made frantic appeals, beseeching them by name.



<P>Between him and the lieutenant, scolding and



<P>near to losing his mind with rage, there was felt a



<P>subtle fellowship and equality.&nbsp; They supported



<P>each other in all manner of hoarse, howling pro-



<P>tests.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But the regiment was a machine run down.



<P>The two men babbled at a forceless thing.&nbsp; The



<P>soldiers who had heart to go slowly were con-



<P>tinually shaken in their resolves by a knowledge



<P>that comrades were slipping with speed back to



<P>the lines.&nbsp; It was difficult to think of reputation



<P>when others were thinking of skins.&nbsp; Wounded



<P>men were left crying on this black journey.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The smoke fringes and flames blustered al-



<P>ways.&nbsp; The youth, peering once through a sud-



<P>den rift in a cloud, saw a brown mass of troops,



<P>interwoven and magnified until they appeared to



<P>be thousands.&nbsp; A fierce-hued flag flashed before



<P>his vision.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Immediately, as if the uplifting of the smoke



<P>had been prearranged, the discovered troops



<P>burst into a rasping yell, and a hundred flames



<P>jetted toward the retreating band.&nbsp; A rolling



<P>gray cloud again interposed as the regiment dog-



<P>gedly replied.&nbsp; The youth had to depend again



<P>upon his misused ears, which were trembling



<P>and buzzing from the melee of musketry and yells.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The way seemed eternal.&nbsp; In the clouded haze



<P>men became panicstricken with the thought that



<P>the regiment had lost its path, and was proceed-



<P>ing in a perilous direction.&nbsp; Once the men who



<P>headed the wild procession turned and came push-



<P>ing back against their comrades, screaming that



<P>they were being fired upon from points which



<P>they had considered to be toward their own lines.



<P>At this cry a hysterical fear and dismay beset the



<P>troops.&nbsp; A soldier, who heretofore had been am-



<P>bitious to make the regiment into a wise little



<P>band that would proceed calmly amid the huge-



<P>appearing difficulties, suddenly sank down and



<P>buried his face in his arms with an air of bowing



<P>to a doom.&nbsp; From another a shrill lamentation



<P>rang out filled with profane allusions to a general.



<P>Men ran hither and thither, seeking with their



<P>eyes roads of escape.&nbsp; With serene regularity, as



<P>if controlled by a schedule, bullets buffed into



<P>men.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth walked stolidly into the midst of



<P>the mob, and with his flag in his hands took a



<P>stand as if he expected an attempt to push him to



<P>the ground.&nbsp; He unconsciously assumed the atti-



<P>tude of the color bearer in the fight of the pre-



<P>ceding day.&nbsp; He passed over his brow a hand



<P>that trembled.&nbsp; His breath did not come freely.



<P>He was choking during this small wait for the



<P>crisis.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His friend came to him.&nbsp; "Well, Henry, I



<P>guess this is good-by--John."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, shut up, you damned fool!" replied the



<P>youth, and he would not look at the other.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The officers labored like politicians to beat



<P>the mass into a proper circle to face the men-



<P>aces.&nbsp; The ground was uneven and torn.&nbsp; The



<P>men curled into depressions and fitted them-



<P>selves snugly behind whatever would frustrate



<P>a bullet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth noted with vague surprise that the



<P>lieutenant was standing mutely with his legs far



<P>apart and his sword held in the manner of a cane.



<P>The youth wondered what had happened to his



<P>vocal organs that he no more cursed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was something curious in this little in-



<P>tent pause of the lieutenant.&nbsp; He was like a babe



<P>which, having wept its fill, raises its eyes and



<P>fixes upon a distant toy.&nbsp; He was engrossed in



<P>this contemplation, and the soft under lip quivered



<P>from self-whispered words.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Some lazy and ignorant smoke curled slowly.



<P>The men, hiding from the bullets, waited anx-



<P>iously for it to lift and disclose the plight of the



<P>regiment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The silent ranks were suddenly thrilled by the



<P>eager voice of the youthful lieutenant bawling



<P>out: "Here they come!&nbsp; Right onto us,



<P>b'Gawd!"&nbsp; His further words were lost in a roar



<P>of wicked thunder from the men's rifles.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth's eyes had instantly turned in the



<P>direction indicated by the awakened and agitated



<P>lieutenant, and he had seen the haze of treachery



<P>disclosing a body of soldiers of the enemy.&nbsp; They



<P>were so near that he could see their features.



<P>There was a recognition as he looked at the types



<P>of faces.&nbsp; Also he perceived with dim amazement



<P>that their uniforms were rather gay in effect,



<P>being light gray, accented with a brilliant-hued



<P>facing.&nbsp; Too, the clothes seemed new.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These troops had apparently been going for-



<P>ward with caution, their rifles held in readiness,



<P>when the youthful lieutenant had discovered



<P>them and their movement had been interrupted



<P>by the volley from the blue regiment.&nbsp; From the



<P>moment's glimpse, it was derived that they had



<P>been unaware of the proximity of their dark-



<P>suited foes or had mistaken the direction.&nbsp; Al-



<P>most instantly they were shut utterly from the



<P>youth's sight by the smoke from the energetic



<P>rifles of his companions.&nbsp; He strained his vision



<P>to learn the accomplishment of the volley, but the



<P>smoke hung before him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The two bodies of troops exchanged blows in



<P>the manner of a pair of boxers.&nbsp; The fast angry



<P>firings went back and forth.&nbsp; The men in blue



<P>were intent with the despair of their circum-



<P>stances and they seized upon the revenge to be



<P>had at close range.&nbsp; Their thunder swelled loud



<P>and valiant.&nbsp; Their curving front bristled with



<P>flashes and the place resounded with the clangor



<P>of their ramrods.&nbsp; The youth ducked and dodged



<P>for a time and achieved a few unsatisfactory



<P>views of the enemy.&nbsp; There appeared to be many



<P>of them and they were replying swiftly.&nbsp; They



<P>seemed moving toward the blue regiment, step



<P>by step.&nbsp; He seated himself gloomily on the



<P>ground with his flag between his knees.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As he noted the vicious, wolflike temper of



<P>his comrades he had a sweet thought that if the



<P>enemy was about to swallow the regimental



<P>broom as a large prisoner, it could at least have



<P>the consolation of going down with bristles for-



<P>ward.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But the blows of the antagonist began to



<P>grow more weak.&nbsp; Fewer bullets ripped the air,



<P>and finally, when the men slackened to learn of



<P>the fight, they could see only dark, floating



<P>smoke.&nbsp; The regiment lay still and gazed.&nbsp; Pres-



<P>ently some chance whim came to the pestering



<P>blur, and it began to coil heavily away.&nbsp; The men



<P>saw a ground vacant of fighters.&nbsp; It would have



<P>been an empty stage if it were not for a few



<P>corpses that lay thrown and twisted into fantastic



<P>shapes upon the sward.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At sight of this tableau, many of the men in



<P>blue sprang from behind their covers and made



<P>an ungainly dance of joy.&nbsp; Their eyes burned



<P>and a hoarse cheer of elation broke from their



<P>dry lips.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It had begun to seem to them that events were



<P>trying to prove that they were impotent.&nbsp; These



<P>little battles had evidently endeavored to demon-



<P>strate that the men could not fight well.&nbsp; When



<P>on the verge of submission to these opinions, the



<P>small duel had showed them that the propor-



<P>tions were not impossible, and by it they had



<P>revenged themselves upon their misgivings and



<P>upon the foe.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The impetus of enthusiasm was theirs again.



<P>They gazed about them with looks of uplifted



<P>pride, feeling new trust in the grim, always



<P>confident weapons in their hands.&nbsp; And they



<P>were men.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>PRESENTLY they knew that no firing threat-



<P>ened them.&nbsp; All ways seemed once more opened



<P>to them.&nbsp; The dusty blue lines of their friends



<P>were disclosed a short distance away.&nbsp; In the



<P>distance there were many colossal noises, but in



<P>all this part of the field there was a sudden



<P>stillness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They perceived that they were free.&nbsp; The



<P>depleted band drew a long breath of relief



<P>and gathered itself into a bunch to complete



<P>its trip.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In this last length of journey the men began



<P>to show strange emotions.&nbsp; They hurried with



<P>nervous fear.&nbsp; Some who had been dark and un-



<P>faltering in the grimmest moments now could not



<P>conceal an anxiety that made them frantic.&nbsp; It



<P>was perhaps that they dreaded to be killed in



<P>insignificant ways after the times for proper



<P>military deaths had passed.&nbsp; Or, perhaps, they



<P>thought it would be too ironical to get killed at

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>199



<P>the portals of safety.&nbsp; With backward looks of



<P>perturbation, they hastened.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As they approached their own lines there was



<P>some sarcasm exhibited on the part of a gaunt



<P>and bronzed regiment that lay resting in the



<P>shade of trees.&nbsp; Questions were wafted to them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Where th' hell yeh been?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What yeh comin' back fer?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why didn't yeh stay there?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Was it warm out there, sonny?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Goin' home now, boys?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One shouted in taunting mimicry: "Oh,



<P>mother, come quick an' look at th' sojers!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was no reply from the bruised and bat-



<P>tered regiment, save that one man made broad-



<P>cast challenges to fist fights and the red-bearded



<P>officer walked rather near and glared in great



<P>swashbuckler style at a tall captain in the other



<P>regiment.&nbsp; But the lieutenant suppressed the



<P>man who wished to fist fight, and the tall cap-



<P>tain, flushing at the little fanfare of the red-



<P>bearded one, was obliged to look intently at some



<P>trees.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth's tender flesh was deeply stung by



<P>these remarks.&nbsp; From under his creased brows



<P>he glowered with hate at the mockers.&nbsp; He



<P>meditated upon a few revenges.&nbsp; Still, many in



<P>the regiment hung their heads in criminal fashion,



<P>so that it came to pass that the men trudged with



<P>sudden heaviness, as if they bore upon their



<P>bended shoulders the coffin of their honor.&nbsp; And



<P>the youthful lieutenant, recollecting himself, be-



<P>gan to mutter softly in black curses.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They turned when they arrived at their old



<P>position to regard the ground over which they



<P>had charged.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth in this contemplation was smitten



<P>with a large astonishment.&nbsp; He discovered that



<P>the distances, as compared with the brilliant



<P>measurings of his mind, were trivial and ridicu-



<P>lous.&nbsp; The stolid trees, where much had taken



<P>place, seemed incredibly near.&nbsp; The time, too,



<P>now that he reflected, he saw to have been short.



<P>He wondered at the number of emotions and



<P>events that had been crowded into such little



<P>spaces.&nbsp; Elfin thoughts must have exaggerated



<P>and enlarged everything, he said.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It seemed, then, that there was bitter justice



<P>in the speeches of the gaunt and bronzed vet-



<P>erans.&nbsp; He veiled a glance of disdain at his fel-



<P>lows who strewed the ground, choking with dust,



<P>red from perspiration, misty-eyed, disheveled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They were gulping at their canteens, fierce to



<P>wring every mite of water from them, and they



<P>polished at their swollen and watery features



<P>with coat sleeves and bunches of grass.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>However, to the youth there was a consider-



<P>able joy in musing upon his performances during



<P>the charge.&nbsp; He had had very little time pre-



<P>viously in which to appreciate himself, so that



<P>there was now much satisfaction in quietly think-



<P>ing of his actions.&nbsp; He recalled bits of color that



<P>in the flurry had stamped themselves unawares



<P>upon his engaged senses.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As the regiment lay heaving from its hot exer-



<P>tions the officer who had named them as mule



<P>drivers came galloping along the line.&nbsp; He had



<P>lost his cap.&nbsp; His tousled hair streamed wildly,



<P>and his face was dark with vexation and wrath.



<P>His temper was displayed with more clearness



<P>by the way in which he managed his horse.&nbsp; He



<P>jerked and wrenched savagely at his bridle, stop-



<P>ping the hard-breathing animal with a furious



<P>pull near the colonel of the regiment.&nbsp; He im-



<P>mediately exploded in reproaches which came



<P>unbidden to the ears of the men.&nbsp; They were



<P>suddenly alert, being always curious about black



<P>words between officers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, thunder, MacChesnay, what an awful



<P>bull you made of this thing!" began the officer.



<P>He attempted low tones, but his indignation



<P>caused certain of the men to learn the sense of



<P>his words.&nbsp; "What an awful mess you made!



<P>Good Lord, man, you stopped about a hun-



<P>dred feet this side of a very pretty success!&nbsp; If



<P>your men had gone a hundred feet farther you



<P>would have made a great charge, but as it is



<P>--what a lot of mud diggers you've got any-



<P>way!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The men, listening with bated breath, now



<P>turned their curious eyes upon the colonel.



<P>They had a ragamuffin interest in this affair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The colonel was seen to straighten his form



<P>and put one hand forth in oratorical fashion.



<P>He wore an injured air; it was as if a deacon



<P>had been accused of stealing.&nbsp; The men were



<P>wiggling in an ecstasy of excitement.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But of a sudden the colonel's manner changed



<P>from that of a deacon to that of a Frenchman.



<P>He shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp; "Oh, well, general,



<P>we went as far as we could," he said calmly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"As far as you could?&nbsp; Did you, b'Gawd?"



<P>snorted the other.&nbsp; "Well, that wasn't very far,



<P>was it?" he added, with a glance of cold con-



<P>tempt into the other's eyes.&nbsp; "Not very far, I



<P>think.&nbsp; You were intended to make a diversion



<P>in favor of Whiterside.&nbsp; How well you succeeded



<P>your own ears can now tell you."&nbsp; He wheeled



<P>his horse and rode stiffly away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The colonel, bidden to hear the jarring noises



<P>of an engagement in the woods to the left, broke



<P>out in vague damnations.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The lieutenant, who had listened with an air



<P>of impotent rage to the interview, spoke suddenly



<P>in firm and undaunted tones.&nbsp; "I don't care what



<P>a man is--whether he is a general or what--if



<P>he says th' boys didn't put up a good fight out



<P>there he's a damned fool."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Lieutenant," began the colonel, severely,



<P>"this is my own affair, and I'll trouble you--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The lieutenant made an obedient gesture.



<P>"All right, colonel, all right," he said.&nbsp; He sat



<P>down with an air of being content with him-



<P>self.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The news that the regiment had been re-



<P>proached went along the line.&nbsp; For a time the



<P>men were bewildered by it.&nbsp; "Good thunder!"



<P>they ejaculated, staring at the vanishing form of



<P>the general.&nbsp; They conceived it to be a huge



<P>mistake.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Presently, however, they began to believe that



<P>in truth their efforts had been called light.&nbsp; The



<P>youth could see this conviction weigh upon the



<P>entire regiment until the men were like cuffed



<P>and cursed animals, but withal rebellious.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The friend, with a grievance in his eye,



<P>went to the youth.&nbsp; "I wonder what he does



<P>want," he said.&nbsp; "He must think we went out



<P>there an' played marbles!&nbsp; I never see sech a



<P>man!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth developed a tranquil philosophy



<P>for these moments of irritation.&nbsp; "Oh, well," he



<P>rejoined, "he probably didn't see nothing of it at



<P>all and got mad as blazes, and concluded we were



<P>a lot of sheep, just because we didn't do what he



<P>wanted done.&nbsp; It's a pity old Grandpa Hender-



<P>son got killed yestirday--he'd have known that



<P>we did our best and fought good.&nbsp; It's just our



<P>awful luck, that's what."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I should say so," replied the friend.&nbsp; He



<P>seemed to be deeply wounded at an injustice.



<P>"I should say we did have awful luck!&nbsp; There's



<P>no fun in fightin' fer people when everything



<P>yeh do--no matter what--ain't done right.&nbsp; I



<P>have a notion t' stay behind next time an' let



<P>'em take their ol' charge an' go t' th' devil



<P>with it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth spoke soothingly to his comrade.



<P>"Well, we both did good.&nbsp; I'd like to see the



<P>fool what'd say we both didn't do as good as we



<P>could!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Of course we did," declared the friend



<P>stoutly.&nbsp; "An' I'd break th' feller's neck if he was



<P>as big as a church.&nbsp; But we're all right, anyhow,



<P>for I heard one feller say that we two fit th' best



<P>in th' reg'ment, an' they had a great argument



<P>'bout it.&nbsp; Another feller, 'a course, he had t' up



<P>an' say it was a lie--he seen all what was goin'



<P>on an' he never seen us from th' beginnin' t' th'



<P>end.&nbsp; An' a lot more struck in an' ses it wasn't



<P>a lie--we did fight like thunder, an' they give



<P>us quite a send-off.&nbsp; But this is what I can't



<P>stand--these everlastin' ol' soldiers, titterin' an'



<P>laughin', an' then that general, he's crazy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth exclaimed with sudden exaspera-



<P>tion: "He's a lunkhead!&nbsp; He makes me mad.



<P>I wish he'd come along next time.&nbsp; We'd show



<P>'im what--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He ceased because several men had come



<P>hurrying up.&nbsp; Their faces expressed a bringing



<P>of great news.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"O Flem, yeh jest oughta heard!" cried one,



<P>eagerly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Heard what?" said the youth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yeh jest oughta heard!" repeated the other,



<P>and he arranged himself to tell his tidings.&nbsp; The



<P>others made an excited circle.&nbsp; "Well, sir, th'



<P>colonel met your lieutenant right by us--it was



<P>damnedest thing I ever heard--an' he ses: 'Ahem!



<P>ahem!' he ses.&nbsp; 'Mr. Hasbrouck!' he ses, 'by



<P>th' way, who was that lad what carried th' flag?'



<P>he ses.&nbsp; There, Flemin', what d' yeh think 'a



<P>that?&nbsp; 'Who was th' lad what carried th' flag?'



<P>he ses, an' th' lieutenant, he speaks up right



<P>away: 'That's Flemin', an' he's a jimhickey,' he



<P>ses, right away.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; I say he did.&nbsp; 'A jim-



<P>hickey,' he ses--those 'r his words.&nbsp; He did, too.



<P>I say he did.&nbsp; If you kin tell this story better



<P>than I kin, go ahead an' tell it.&nbsp; Well, then, keep



<P>yer mouth shet.&nbsp; Th' lieutenant, he ses: 'He's a



<P>jimhickey,' an' th' colonel, he ses: 'Ahem! ahem!



<P>he is, indeed, a very good man t' have, ahem!&nbsp; He



<P>kep' th' flag 'way t' th' front.&nbsp; I saw 'im.&nbsp; He's a



<P>good un,' ses th' colonel.&nbsp; 'You bet,' ses th' lieu-



<P>tenant, 'he an' a feller named Wilson was at th'



<P>head 'a th' charge, an' howlin' like Indians all th'



<P>time,' he ses.&nbsp; 'Head 'a th' charge all th' time,'



<P>he ses.&nbsp; 'A feller named Wilson,' he ses.&nbsp; There,



<P>Wilson, m'boy, put that in a letter an' send it



<P>hum t' yer mother, hay?&nbsp; 'A feller named Wil-



<P>son,' he ses.&nbsp; An' th' colonel, he ses: 'Were they,



<P>indeed?&nbsp; Ahem! ahem!&nbsp; My sakes!' he ses.&nbsp; 'At



<P>th' head 'a th' reg'ment?' he ses.&nbsp; 'They were,'



<P>ses th' lieutenant.&nbsp; 'My sakes!' ses th' colonel.



<P>He ses: 'Well, well, well,' he ses, 'those two



<P>babies?'&nbsp; 'They were,' ses th' lieutenant.



<P>'Well, well,' ses th' colonel, 'they deserve t' be



<P>major generals,' he ses.&nbsp; 'They deserve t' be



<P>major-generals.'

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth and his friend had said: "Huh!"



<P>"Yer lyin', Thompson."&nbsp; "Oh, go t' blazes!"



<P>"He never sed it."&nbsp; "Oh, what a lie!"&nbsp; "Huh!"



<P>But despite these youthful scoffings and embar-



<P>rassments, they knew that their faces were deeply



<P>flushing from thrills of pleasure.&nbsp; They ex-



<P>changed a secret glance of joy and congratula-



<P>tion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They speedily forgot many things.&nbsp; The past



<P>held no pictures of error and disappointment.



<P>They were very happy, and their hearts swelled



<P>with grateful affection for the colonel and the



<P>youthful lieutenant.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>THE youth fell back in the procession until



<P>the tattered soldier was not in sight.&nbsp; Then he



<P>started to walk on with the others.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But he was amid wounds.&nbsp; The mob of men



<P>was bleeding.&nbsp; Because of the tattered soldier's



<P>question he now felt that his shame could be



<P>viewed.&nbsp; He was continually casting sidelong



<P>glances to see if the men were contemplating the



<P>letters of guilt he felt burned into his brow.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At times he regarded the wounded soldiers



<P>in an envious way.&nbsp; He conceived persons with



<P>torn bodies to be peculiarly happy.&nbsp; He wished



<P>that he, too, had a wound, a red badge of cour-



<P>age.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The spectral soldier was at his side like a



<P>stalking reproach.&nbsp; The man's eyes were still



<P>fixed in a stare into the unknown.&nbsp; His gray,



<P>appalling face had attracted attention in the



<P>crowd, and men, slowing to his dreary pace, were



<P>walking with him.&nbsp; They were discussing his



<P>plight, questioning him and giving him advice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>91



<P>In a dogged way he repelled them, signing to them



<P>to go on and leave him alone.&nbsp; The shadows of



<P>his face were deepening and his tight lips seemed



<P>holding in check the moan of great despair.



<P>There could be seen a certain stiffness in the



<P>movements of his body, as if he were taking



<P>infinite care not to arouse the passion of his



<P>wounds.&nbsp; As he went on, he seemed always look-



<P>ing for a place, like one who goes to choose a



<P>grave.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Something in the gesture of the man as he



<P>waved the bloody and pitying soldiers away



<P>made the youth start as if bitten.&nbsp; He yelled in



<P>horror.&nbsp; Tottering forward he laid a quivering



<P>hand upon the man's arm.&nbsp; As the latter slowly



<P>turned his waxlike features toward him, the



<P>youth screamed:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Gawd!&nbsp; Jim Conklin!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The tall soldier made a little commonplace



<P>smile.&nbsp; "Hello, Henry," he said.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth swayed on his legs and glared



<P>strangely.&nbsp; He stuttered and stammered.&nbsp; "Oh,



<P>Jim--oh, Jim--oh, Jim--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The tall soldier held out his gory hand.&nbsp; There



<P>was a curious red and black combination of new



<P>blood and old blood upon it.&nbsp; "Where yeh been,



<P>Henry?" he asked.&nbsp; He continued in a monoto-



<P>nous voice, "I thought mebbe yeh got keeled



<P>over.&nbsp; There 's been thunder t' pay t'-day.&nbsp; I was



<P>worryin' about it a good deal."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth still lamented.&nbsp; "Oh, Jim--oh, Jim



<P>--oh, Jim--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yeh know," said the tall soldier, "I was out



<P>there."&nbsp; He made a careful gesture.&nbsp; "An',



<P>Lord, what a circus!&nbsp; An', b'jiminey, I got shot--



<P>I got shot.&nbsp; Yes, b'jiminey, I got shot."&nbsp; He



<P>reiterated this fact in a bewildered way, as if he



<P>did not know how it came about.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth put forth anxious arms to assist



<P>him, but the tall soldier went firmly on as if pro-



<P>pelled.&nbsp; Since the youth's arrival as a guardian



<P>for his friend, the other wounded men had ceased



<P>to display much interest.&nbsp; They occupied them-



<P>selves again in dragging their own tragedies



<P>toward the rear.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Suddenly, as the two friends marched on, the



<P>tall soldier seemed to be overcome by a terror.



<P>His face turned to a semblance of gray paste.



<P>He clutched the youth's arm and looked all about



<P>him, as if dreading to be overheard.&nbsp; Then he



<P>began to speak in a shaking whisper:

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I tell yeh what I'm 'fraid of, Henry--I 'll tell



<P>yeh what I 'm 'fraid of.&nbsp; I 'm 'fraid I 'll fall down



<P>--an' then yeh know--them damned artillery



<P>wagons--they like as not 'll run over me.&nbsp; That 's



<P>what I 'm 'fraid of--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth cried out to him hysterically: "I 'll



<P>take care of yeh, Jim!&nbsp; I'll take care of yeh!&nbsp; I



<P>swear t' Gawd I will!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Sure--will yeh, Henry?" the tall soldier



<P>beseeched.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes--yes--I tell yeh--I'll take care of yeh,



<P>Jim!" protested the youth.&nbsp; He could not speak



<P>accurately because of the gulpings in his throat.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But the tall soldier continued to beg in a



<P>lowly way.&nbsp; He now hung babelike to the



<P>youth's arm.&nbsp; His eyes rolled in the wildness of



<P>his terror.&nbsp; "I was allus a good friend t' yeh,



<P>wa'n't I, Henry?&nbsp; I 've allus been a pretty good



<P>feller, ain't I?&nbsp; An' it ain't much t' ask, is it?&nbsp; Jest



<P>t' pull me along outer th' road?&nbsp; I 'd do it fer you,



<P>Wouldn't I, Henry?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He paused in piteous anxiety to await his



<P>friend's reply.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth had reached an anguish where the



<P>sobs scorched him.&nbsp; He strove to express his



<P>loyalty, but he could only make fantastic gestures.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>However, the tall soldier seemed suddenly to



<P>forget all those fears.&nbsp; He became again the



<P>grim, stalking specter of a soldier.&nbsp; He went



<P>stonily forward.&nbsp; The youth wished his friend to



<P>lean upon him, but the other always shook his



<P>head and strangely protested.&nbsp; "No--no--no--



<P>leave me be--leave me be--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His look was fixed again upon the unknown.



<P>He moved with mysterious purpose, and all of



<P>the youth's offers he brushed aside.&nbsp; "No--no--



<P>leave me be--leave me be--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth had to follow.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Presently the latter heard a voice talking



<P>softly near his shoulders.&nbsp; Turning he saw that it



<P>belonged to the tattered soldier.&nbsp; "Ye 'd better



<P>take 'im outa th' road, pardner.&nbsp; There 's a batt'ry



<P>comin' helitywhoop down th' road an' he 'll git



<P>runned over.&nbsp; He 's a goner anyhow in about five



<P>minutes--yeh kin see that.&nbsp; Ye 'd better take 'im



<P>outa th' road.&nbsp; Where th' blazes does he git his



<P>stren'th from?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Lord knows!" cried the youth.&nbsp; He was



<P>shaking his hands helplessly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He ran forward presently and grasped the



<P>tall soldier by the arm.&nbsp; "Jim!&nbsp; Jim!" he coaxed,



<P>"come with me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The tall soldier weakly tried to wrench himself



<P>free.&nbsp; "Huh," he said vacantly.&nbsp; He stared at the



<P>youth for a moment.&nbsp; At last he spoke as if dimly



<P>comprehending.&nbsp; "Oh!&nbsp; Inteh th' fields?&nbsp; Oh!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He started blindly through the grass.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth turned once to look at the lashing



<P>riders and jouncing guns of the battery.&nbsp; He was



<P>startled from this view by a shrill outcry from



<P>the tattered man.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Gawd!&nbsp; He's runnin'!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Turning his head swiftly, the youth saw his



<P>friend running in a staggering and stumbling



<P>way toward a little clump of bushes.&nbsp; His heart



<P>seemed to wrench itself almost free from his



<P>body at this sight.&nbsp; He made a noise of pain.



<P>He and the tattered man began a pursuit.&nbsp; There



<P>was a singular race.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When he overtook the tall soldier he began



<P>to plead with all the words he could find.&nbsp; "Jim



<P>--Jim--what are you doing--what makes you do



<P>this way--you 'll hurt yerself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The same purpose was in the tall soldier's face.



<P>He protested in a dulled way, keeping his eyes



<P>fastened on the mystic place of his intentions.



<P>"No--no--don't tech me--leave me be--leave



<P>me be--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth, aghast and filled with wonder at the



<P>tall soldier, began quaveringly to question him.



<P>"Where yeh goin', Jim?&nbsp; What you thinking



<P>about?&nbsp; Where you going?&nbsp; Tell me, won't you,



<P>Jim?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The tall soldier faced about as upon relentless



<P>pursuers.&nbsp; In his eyes there was a great appeal.



<P>"Leave me be, can't yeh?&nbsp; Leave me be fer a



<P>minnit."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth recoiled.&nbsp; "Why, Jim," he said, in



<P>a dazed way, "what's the matter with you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The tall soldier turned and, lurching danger-



<P>ously, went on.&nbsp; The youth and the tattered



<P>soldier followed, sneaking as if whipped, feeling



<P>unable to face the stricken man if he should again



<P>confront them.&nbsp; They began to have thoughts of



<P>a solemn ceremony.&nbsp; There was something rite-



<P>like in these movements of the doomed soldier.



<P>And there was a resemblance in him to a devotee



<P>of a mad religion, blood-sucking, muscle-wrench-



<P>ing, bone-crushing.&nbsp; They were awed and afraid.



<P>They hung back lest he have at command a



<P>dreadful weapon.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At last, they saw him stop and stand motion-



<P>less.&nbsp; Hastening up, they perceived that his face



<P>wore an expression telling that he had at last



<P>found the place for which he had struggled.&nbsp; His



<P>spare figure was erect; his bloody hands were



<P>quietly at his side.&nbsp; He was waiting with patience



<P>for something that he had come to meet.&nbsp; He was



<P>at the rendezvous.&nbsp; They paused and stood, ex-



<P>pectant.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a silence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Finally, the chest of the doomed soldier began



<P>to heave with a strained motion.&nbsp; It increased in



<P>violence until it was as if an animal was within



<P>and was kicking and tumbling furiously to be



<P>free.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This spectacle of gradual strangulation made



<P>the youth writhe, and once as his friend rolled his



<P>eyes, he saw something in them that made him



<P>sink wailing to the ground.&nbsp; He raised his voice



<P>in a last supreme call.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Jim--Jim--Jim--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The tall soldier opened his lips and spoke.



<P>He made a gesture.&nbsp; "Leave me be--don't tech



<P>me--leave me be--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was another silence while he waited.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Suddenly, his form stiffened and straightened.



<P>Then it was shaken by a prolonged ague.&nbsp; He



<P>stared into space.&nbsp; To the two watchers there



<P>was a curious and profound dignity in the firm



<P>lines of his awful face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was invaded by a creeping strangeness



<P>that slowly enveloped him.&nbsp; For a moment the



<P>tremor of his legs caused him to dance a sort of



<P>hideous hornpipe.&nbsp; His arms beat wildly about



<P>his head in expression of implike enthusiasm.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His tall figure stretched itself to its full height.



<P>There was a slight rending sound.&nbsp; Then it began



<P>to swing forward, slow and straight, in the man-



<P>ner of a falling tree.&nbsp; A swift muscular contortion



<P>made the left shoulder strike the ground first.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The body seemed to bounce a little way from



<P>the earth.&nbsp; "God!" said the tattered soldier.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth had watched, spellbound, this



<P>ceremony at the place of meeting.&nbsp; His face



<P>had been twisted into an expression of every



<P>agony he had imagined for his friend.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He now sprang to his feet and, going closer,



<P>gazed upon the pastelike face.&nbsp; The mouth was



<P>open and the teeth showed in a laugh.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As the flap of the blue jacket fell away from



<P>the body, he could see that the side looked as if it



<P>had been chewed by wolves.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth turned, with sudden, livid rage,



<P>toward the battlefield.&nbsp; He shook his fist.&nbsp; He



<P>seemed about to deliver a philippic.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hell--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The red sun was pasted in the sky like a wafer.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>THE colonel came running along back of the



<P>line.&nbsp; There were other officers following him.



<P>"We must charge'm!" they shouted.&nbsp; "We must



<P>charge'm!" they cried with resentful voices, as



<P>if anticipating a rebellion against this plan by the



<P>men.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth, upon hearing the shouts, began to



<P>study the distance between him and the enemy.



<P>He made vague calculations.&nbsp; He saw that to be



<P>firm soldiers they must go forward.&nbsp; It would be



<P>death to stay in the present place, and with all



<P>the circumstances to go backward would exalt



<P>too many others.&nbsp; Their hope was to push the



<P>galling foes away from the fence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He expected that his companions, weary and



<P>stiffened, would have to be driven to this assault,



<P>but as he turned toward them he perceived with



<P>a certain surprise that they were giving quick



<P>and unqualified expressions of assent.&nbsp; There was



<P>an ominous, clanging overture to the charge

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>217



<P>when the shafts of the bayonets rattled upon the



<P>rifle barrels.&nbsp; At the yelled words of command



<P>the soldiers sprang forward in eager leaps.



<P>There was new and unexpected force in the



<P>movement of the regiment.&nbsp; A knowledge of its



<P>faded and jaded condition made the charge ap-



<P>pear like a paroxysm, a display of the strength



<P>that comes before a final feebleness.&nbsp; The men



<P>scampered in insane fever of haste, racing as if to



<P>achieve a sudden success before an exhilarating



<P>fluid should leave them.&nbsp; It was a blind and de-



<P>spairing rush by the collection of men in dusty



<P>and tattered blue, over a green sward and under



<P>a sapphire sky, toward a fence, dimly outlined in



<P>smoke, from behind which spluttered the fierce



<P>rifles of enemies.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth kept the bright colors to the front.



<P>He was waving his free arm in furious circles,



<P>the while shrieking mad calls and appeals, urging



<P>on those that did not need to be urged, for it



<P>seemed that the mob of blue men hurling them-



<P>selves on the dangerous group of rifles were



<P>again grown suddenly wild with an enthusiasm of



<P>unselfishness.&nbsp; From the many firings starting



<P>toward them, it looked as if they would merely



<P>succeed in making a great sprinkling of corpses



<P>on the grass between their former position and



<P>the fence.&nbsp; But they were in a state of frenzy,



<P>perhaps because of forgotten vanities, and it made



<P>an exhibition of sublime recklessness.&nbsp; There was



<P>no obvious questioning, nor figurings, nor dia-



<P>grams.&nbsp; There was, apparently, no considered



<P>loopholes.&nbsp; It appeared that the swift wings of



<P>their desires would have shattered against the



<P>iron gates of the impossible.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He himself felt the daring spirit of a savage



<P>religion mad.&nbsp; He was capable of profound sacri-



<P>fices, a tremendous death.&nbsp; He had no time for



<P>dissections, but he knew that he thought of the



<P>bullets only as things that could prevent him



<P>from reaching the place of his endeavor.&nbsp; There



<P>were subtle flashings of joy within him that thus



<P>should be his mind.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He strained all his strength.&nbsp; His eyesight



<P>was shaken and dazzled by the tension of thought



<P>and muscle.&nbsp; He did not see anything excepting



<P>the mist of smoke gashed by the little knives of



<P>fire, but he knew that in it lay the aged fence of a



<P>vanished farmer protecting the snuggled bodies



<P>of the gray men.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As he ran a thought of the shock of contact



<P>gleamed in his mind.&nbsp; He expected a great con-



<P>cussion when the two bodies of troops crashed



<P>together.&nbsp; This became a part of his wild battle



<P>madness.&nbsp; He could feel the onward swing of the



<P>regiment about him and he conceived of a thun-



<P>derous, crushing blow that would prostrate the



<P>resistance and spread consternation and amaze-



<P>ment for miles.&nbsp; The flying regiment was going



<P>to have a catapultian effect.&nbsp; This dream made



<P>him run faster among his comrades, who were



<P>giving vent to hoarse and frantic cheers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But presently he could see that many of the



<P>men in gray did not intend to abide the blow.



<P>The smoke, rolling, disclosed men who ran, their



<P>faces still turned.&nbsp; These grew to a crowd, who



<P>retired stubbornly.&nbsp; Individuals wheeled fre-



<P>quently to send a bullet at the blue wave.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But at one part of the line there was a grim



<P>and obdurate group that made no movement.



<P>They were settled firmly down behind posts and



<P>rails.&nbsp; A flag, ruffled and fierce, waved over them



<P>and their rifles dinned fiercely.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The blue whirl of men got very near, until



<P>it seemed that in truth there would be a close



<P>and frightful scuffle.&nbsp; There was an expressed



<P>disdain in the opposition of the little group,



<P>that changed the meaning of the cheers of the



<P>men in blue.&nbsp; They became yells of wrath,



<P>directed, personal.&nbsp; The cries of the two parties



<P>were now in sound an interchange of scathing



<P>insults.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They in blue showed their teeth; their eyes



<P>shone all white.&nbsp; They launched themselves as at



<P>the throats of those who stood resisting.&nbsp; The



<P>space between dwindled to an insignificant dis-



<P>tance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth had centered the gaze of his soul



<P>upon that other flag.&nbsp; Its possession would be



<P>high pride.&nbsp; It would express bloody minglings,



<P>near blows.&nbsp; He had a gigantic hatred for those



<P>who made great difficulties and complications.



<P>They caused it to be as a craved treasure of my-



<P>thology, hung amid tasks and contrivances of



<P>danger.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He plunged like a mad horse at it.&nbsp; He was



<P>resolved it should not escape if wild blows and



<P>darings of blows could seize it.&nbsp; His own em-



<P>blem, quivering and aflare, was winging toward



<P>the other.&nbsp; It seemed there would shortly be



<P>an encounter of strange beaks and claws, as of



<P>eagles.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The swirling body of blue men came to a



<P>sudden halt at close and disastrous range and



<P>roared a swift volley.&nbsp; The group in gray was



<P>split and broken by this fire, but its riddled body



<P>still fought.&nbsp; The men in blue yelled again and



<P>rushed in upon it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth, in his leapings, saw, as through a



<P>mist, a picture of four or five men stretched upon



<P>the ground or writhing upon their knees with



<P>bowed heads as if they had been stricken by bolts



<P>from the sky.&nbsp; Tottering among them was the



<P>rival color bearer, whom the youth saw had been



<P>bitten vitally by the bullets of the last formidable



<P>volley.&nbsp; He perceived this man fighting a last



<P>struggle, the struggle of one whose legs are



<P>grasped by demons.&nbsp; It was a ghastly battle.



<P>Over his face was the bleach of death, but set



<P>upon it was the dark and hard lines of desperate



<P>purpose.&nbsp; With this terrible grin of resolution he



<P>hugged his precious flag to him and was stum-



<P>bling and staggering in his design to go the way



<P>that led to safety for it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But his wounds always made it seem that his



<P>feet were retarded, held, and he fought a grim



<P>fight, as with invisible ghouls fastened greedily



<P>upon his limbs.&nbsp; Those in advance of the scam-



<P>pering blue men, howling cheers, leaped at the



<P>fence.&nbsp; The despair of the lost was in his eyes as



<P>he glanced back at them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth's friend went over the obstruction



<P>in a tumbling heap and sprang at the flag as a



<P>panther at prey.&nbsp; He pulled at it and, wrench-



<P>ing it free, swung up its red brilliancy with a



<P>mad cry of exultation even as the color bearer,



<P>gasping, lurched over in a final throe and, stiff-



<P>ening convulsively, turned his dead face to the



<P>ground.&nbsp; There was much blood upon the grass



<P>blades.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At the place of success there began more wild



<P>clamorings of cheers.&nbsp; The men gesticulated and



<P>bellowed in an ecstasy.&nbsp; When they spoke it was



<P>as if they considered their listener to be a mile



<P>away.&nbsp; What hats and caps were left to them



<P>they often slung high in the air.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At one part of the line four men had been



<P>swooped upon, and they now sat as prisoners.



<P>Some blue men were about them in an eager and



<P>curious circle.&nbsp; The soldiers had trapped strange



<P>birds, and there was an examination.&nbsp; A flurry of



<P>fast questions was in the air.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One of the prisoners was nursing a superficial



<P>wound in the foot.&nbsp; He cuddled it, baby-wise,



<P>but he looked up from it often to curse with an



<P>astonishing utter abandon straight at the noses of



<P>his captors.&nbsp; He consigned them to red regions;



<P>he called upon the pestilential wrath of strange



<P>gods.&nbsp; And with it all he was singularly free



<P>from recognition of the finer points of the con-



<P>duct of prisoners of war.&nbsp; It was as if a clumsy



<P>clod had trod upon his toe and he conceived it to



<P>be his privilege, his duty, to use deep, resentful



<P>oaths.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Another, who was a boy in years, took his



<P>plight with great calmness and apparent good



<P>nature.&nbsp; He conversed with the men in blue,



<P>studying their faces with his bright and keen



<P>eyes.&nbsp; They spoke of battles and conditions.



<P>There was an acute interest in all their faces dur-



<P>ing this exchange of view points.&nbsp; It seemed a



<P>great satisfaction to hear voices from where all



<P>had been darkness and speculation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The third captive sat with a morose counte-



<P>nance.&nbsp; He preserved a stoical and cold attitude.



<P>To all advances he made one reply without varia-



<P>tion, "Ah, go t' hell!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The last of the four was always silent and,



<P>for the most part, kept his face turned in un-



<P>molested directions.&nbsp; From the views the youth



<P>received he seemed to be in a state of absolute



<P>dejection.&nbsp; Shame was upon him, and with it



<P>profound regret that he was, perhaps, no more



<P>to be counted in the ranks of his fellows.&nbsp; The



<P>youth could detect no expression that would



<P>allow him to believe that the other was giving



<P>a thought to his narrowed future, the pictured



<P>dungeons, perhaps, and starvations and brutali-



<P>ties, liable to the imagination.&nbsp; All to be seen



<P>was shame for captivity and regret for the right



<P>to antagonize.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After the men had celebrated sufficiently they



<P>settled down behind the old rail fence, on the



<P>opposite side to the one from which their foes



<P>had been driven.&nbsp; A few shot perfunctorily at



<P>distant marks.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was some long grass.&nbsp; The youth



<P>nestled in it and rested, making a convenient rail



<P>support the flag.&nbsp; His friend, jubilant and glori-



<P>fied, holding his treasure with vanity, came to



<P>him there.&nbsp; They sat side by side and congratu-



<P>lated each other.

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>WHEN the woods again began to pour forth



<P>the dark-hued masses of the enemy the youth felt



<P>serene self-confidence.&nbsp; He smiled briefly when



<P>he saw men dodge and duck at the long screech-



<P>ings of shells that were thrown in giant handfuls



<P>over them.&nbsp; He stood, erect and tranquil, watch-



<P>ing the attack begin against a part of the line



<P>that made a blue curve along the side of an adja-



<P>cent hill.&nbsp; His vision being unmolested by smoke



<P>from the rifles of his companions, he had oppor-



<P>tunities to see parts of the hard fight.&nbsp; It was a



<P>relief to perceive at last from whence came some



<P>of these noises which had been roared into his



<P>ears.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Off a short way he saw two regiments fight-



<P>ing a little separate battle with two other regi-



<P>ments.&nbsp; It was in a cleared space, wearing a set-



<P>apart look.&nbsp; They were blazing as if upon a



<P>wager, giving and taking tremendous blows.



<P>The firings were incredibly fierce and rapid.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>209



<P>These intent regiments apparently were oblivious



<P>of all larger purposes of war, and were slugging



<P>each other as if at a matched game.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In another direction he saw a magnificent



<P>brigade going with the evident intention of driv-



<P>ing the enemy from a wood.&nbsp; They passed in out



<P>of sight and presently there was a most awe-in-



<P>spiring racket in the wood.&nbsp; The noise was un-



<P>speakable.&nbsp; Having stirred this prodigious up-



<P>roar, and, apparently, finding it too prodigious,



<P>the brigade, after a little time, came marching



<P>airily out again with its fine formation in nowise



<P>disturbed.&nbsp; There were no traces of speed in its



<P>movements.&nbsp; The brigade was jaunty and seemed



<P>to point a proud thumb at the yelling wood.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On a slope to the left there was a long row of



<P>guns, gruff and maddened, denouncing the



<P>enemy, who, down through the woods, were



<P>forming for another attack in the pitiless mo-



<P>notony of conflicts.&nbsp; The round red discharges



<P>from the guns made a crimson flare and a high,



<P>thick smoke.&nbsp; Occasional glimpses could be



<P>caught of groups of the toiling artillerymen.&nbsp; In



<P>the rear of this row of guns stood a house, calm



<P>and white, amid bursting shells.&nbsp; A congregation



<P>of horses, tied to a long railing, were tugging



<P>frenziedly at their bridles.&nbsp; Men were running



<P>hither and thither.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The detached battle between the four regi-



<P>ments lasted for some time.&nbsp; There chanced to



<P>be no interference, and they settled their dispute



<P>by themselves.&nbsp; They struck savagely and pow-



<P>erfully at each other for a period of minutes, and



<P>then the lighter-hued regiments faltered and



<P>drew back, leaving the dark-blue lines shouting.



<P>The youth could see the two flags shaking with



<P>laughter amid the smoke remnants.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Presently there was a stillness, pregnant with



<P>meaning.&nbsp; The blue lines shifted and changed a



<P>trifle and stared expectantly at the silent woods



<P>and fields before them.&nbsp; The hush was solemn



<P>and churchlike, save for a distant battery that,



<P>evidently unable to remain quiet, sent a faint



<P>rolling thunder over the ground.&nbsp; It irritated,



<P>like the noises of unimpressed boys.&nbsp; The men



<P>imagined that it would prevent their perched



<P>ears from hearing the first words of the new



<P>battle.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Of a sudden the guns on the slope roared out



<P>a message of warning.&nbsp; A spluttering sound had



<P>begun in the woods.&nbsp; It swelled with amazing



<P>speed to a profound clamor that involved the



<P>earth in noises.&nbsp; The splitting crashes swept



<P>along the lines until an interminable roar was



<P>developed.&nbsp; To those in the midst of it it became



<P>a din fitted to the universe.&nbsp; It was the whirring



<P>and thumping of gigantic machinery, complica-



<P>tions among the smaller stars.&nbsp; The youth's ears



<P>were filled up.&nbsp; They were incapable of hearing



<P>more.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On an incline over which a road wound he



<P>saw wild and desperate rushes of men perpet-



<P>ually backward and forward in riotous surges.



<P>These parts of the opposing armies were two



<P>long waves that pitched upon each other madly



<P>at dictated points.&nbsp; To and fro they swelled.



<P>Sometimes, one side by its yells and cheers would



<P>proclaim decisive blows, but a moment later



<P>the other side would be all yells and cheers.



<P>Once the youth saw a spray of light forms go in



<P>houndlike leaps toward the waving blue lines.



<P>There was much howling, and presently it went



<P>away with a vast mouthful of prisoners.&nbsp; Again,



<P>he saw a blue wave dash with such thunderous



<P>force against a gray obstruction that it seemed to



<P>clear the earth of it and leave nothing but



<P>trampled sod.&nbsp; And always in their swift and



<P>deadly rushes to and fro the men screamed



<P>and yelled like maniacs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Particular pieces of fence or secure positions



<P>behind collections of trees were wrangled over,



<P>as gold thrones or pearl bedsteads.&nbsp; There were



<P>desperate lunges at these chosen spots seemingly



<P>every instant, and most of them were bandied like



<P>light toys between the contending forces.&nbsp; The



<P>youth could not tell from the battle flags flying



<P>like crimson foam in many directions which color



<P>of cloth was winning.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His emaciated regiment bustled forth with



<P>undiminished fierceness when its time came.



<P>When assaulted again by bullets, the men burst



<P>out in a barbaric cry of rage and pain.&nbsp; They



<P>bent their heads in aims of intent hatred



<P>behind the projected hammers of their guns.



<P>Their ramrods clanged loud with fury as their



<P>eager arms pounded the cartridges into the rifle



<P>barrels.&nbsp; The front of the regiment was a smoke-



<P>wall penetrated by the flashing points of yellow



<P>and red.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Wallowing in the fight, they were in an



<P>astonishingly short time resmudged.&nbsp; They



<P>surpassed in stain and dirt all their previous ap-



<P>pearances.&nbsp; Moving to and fro with strained



<P>exertion, jabbering the while, they were, with



<P>their swaying bodies, black faces, and glowing



<P>eyes, like strange and ugly friends jigging heavily



<P>in the smoke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The lieutenant, returning from a tour after a



<P>bandage, produced from a hidden receptacle of



<P>his mind new and portentous oaths suited to the



<P>emergency.&nbsp; Strings of expletives he swung



<P>lashlike over the backs of his men, and it was



<P>evident that his previous efforts had in nowise



<P>impaired his resources.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth, still the bearer of the colors, did



<P>not feel his idleness.&nbsp; He was deeply absorbed as



<P>a spectator.&nbsp; The crash and swing of the great



<P>drama made him lean forward, intent-eyed, his



<P>face working in small contortions.&nbsp; Sometimes he



<P>prattled, words coming unconsciously from him



<P>in grotesque exclamations.&nbsp; He did not know



<P>that he breathed; that the flag hung silently over



<P>him, so absorbed was he.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A formidable line of the enemy came within



<P>dangerous range.&nbsp; They could be seen plainly--



<P>tall, gaunt men with excited faces running with



<P>long strides toward a wandering fence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At sight of this danger the men suddenly



<P>ceased their cursing monotone.&nbsp; There was an



<P>instant of strained silence before they threw up



<P>their rifles and fired a plumping volley at the



<P>foes.&nbsp; There had been no order given; the men,



<P>upon recognizing the menace, had immedi-



<P>ately let drive their flock of bullets without wait-



<P>ing for word of command.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But the enemy were quick to gain the protec-



<P>tion of the wandering line of fence.&nbsp; They slid down



<P>behind it with remarkable celerity, and from this



<P>position they began briskly to slice up the blue men.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These latter braced their energies for a great



<P>struggle.&nbsp; Often, white clinched teeth shone



<P>from the dusky faces.&nbsp; Many heads surged to



<P>and fro, floating upon a pale sea of smoke.



<P>Those behind the fence frequently shouted and



<P>yelped in taunts and gibelike cries, but the regi-



<P>ment maintained a stressed silence.&nbsp; Perhaps, at



<P>this new assault the men recalled the fact that



<P>they had been named mud diggers, and it made



<P>their situation thrice bitter.&nbsp; They were breath-



<P>lessly intent upon keeping the ground and thrust-



<P>ing away the rejoicing body of the enemy.&nbsp; They



<P>fought swiftly and with a despairing savageness



<P>denoted in their expressions.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth had resolved not to budge what-



<P>ever should happen.&nbsp; Some arrows of scorn that



<P>had buried themselves in his heart had generated



<P>strange and unspeakable hatred.&nbsp; It was clear



<P>to him that his final and absolute revenge was to



<P>be achieved by his dead body lying, torn and



<P>gluttering, upon the field.&nbsp; This was to be a



<P>poignant retaliation upon the officer who had



<P>said "mule drivers," and later "mud diggers,"



<P>for in all the wild graspings of his mind for a



<P>unit responsible for his sufferings and commo-



<P>tions he always seized upon the man who had



<P>dubbed him wrongly.&nbsp; And it was his idea,



<P>vaguely formulated, that his corpse would be for



<P>those eyes a great and salt reproach.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The regiment bled extravagantly.&nbsp; Grunting



<P>bundles of blue began to drop.&nbsp; The orderly



<P>sergeant of the youth's company was shot through



<P>the cheeks.&nbsp; Its supports being injured, his jaw



<P>hung afar down, disclosing in the wide cavern of



<P>his mouth a pulsing mass of blood and teeth.



<P>And with it all he made attempts to cry out.



<P>In his endeavor there was a dreadful earnestness,



<P>as if he conceived that one great shriek would



<P>make him well.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth saw him presently go rearward.



<P>His strength seemed in nowise impaired.&nbsp; He



<P>ran swiftly, casting wild glances for succor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Others fell down about the feet of their com-



<P>panions.&nbsp; Some of the wounded crawled out and



<P>away, but many lay still, their bodies twisted into



<P>impossible shapes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth looked once for his friend.&nbsp; He



<P>saw a vehement young man, powder-smeared and



<P>frowzled, whom he knew to be him.&nbsp; The lieu-



<P>tenant, also, was unscathed in his position at the



<P>rear.&nbsp; He had continued to curse, but it was now



<P>with the air of a man who was using his last box



<P>of oaths.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For the fire of the regiment had begun to



<P>wane and drip.&nbsp; The robust voice, that had come



<P>strangely from the thin ranks, was growing



<P>rapidly weak.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>THE youth went slowly toward the fire in-



<P>dicated by his departed friend.&nbsp; As he reeled, he



<P>bethought him of the welcome his comrades



<P>would give him.&nbsp; He had a conviction that he



<P>would soon feel in his sore heart the barbed



<P>missiles of ridicule.&nbsp; He had no strength to in-



<P>vent a tale; he would be a soft target.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He made vague plans to go off into the deeper



<P>darkness and hide, but they were all destroyed



<P>by the voices of exhaustion and pain from his



<P>body.&nbsp; His ailments, clamoring, forced him to



<P>seek the place of food and rest, at whatever cost.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He swung unsteadily toward the fire.&nbsp; He



<P>could see the forms of men throwing black



<P>shadows in the red light, and as he went nearer



<P>it became known to him in some way that the



<P>ground was strewn with sleeping men.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Of a sudden he confronted a black and



<P>monstrous figure.&nbsp; A rifle barrel caught some



<P>glinting beams.&nbsp; "Halt! halt!"&nbsp; He was dis-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>129



<P>mayed for a moment, but he presently thought



<P>that he recognized the nervous voice.&nbsp; As he



<P>stood tottering before the rifle barrel, he called



<P>out: "Why, hello, Wilson, you--you here?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The rifle was lowered to a position of caution



<P>and the loud soldier came slowly forward.&nbsp; He



<P>peered into the youth's face.&nbsp; "That you,



<P>Henry?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, it's--it's me."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, well, ol' boy," said the other, "by



<P>ginger, I'm glad t' see yeh!&nbsp; I give yeh up



<P>fer a goner.&nbsp; I thought yeh was dead sure



<P>enough."&nbsp; There was husky emotion in his



<P>voice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth found that now he could barely



<P>stand upon his feet.&nbsp; There was a sudden sinking



<P>of his forces.&nbsp; He thought he must hasten to pro-



<P>duce his tale to protect him from the missiles



<P>already at the lips of his redoubtable comrades.



<P>So, staggering before the loud soldier, he began:



<P>"Yes, yes.&nbsp; I've--I've had an awful time.&nbsp; I've



<P>been all over.&nbsp; Way over on th' right.&nbsp; Ter'ble



<P>fightin' over there.&nbsp; I had an awful time.&nbsp; I got



<P>separated from th' reg'ment.&nbsp; Over on th' right,



<P>I got shot.&nbsp; In th' head.&nbsp; I never see sech



<P>fightin'.&nbsp; Awful time.&nbsp; I don't see how I could 'a



<P>got separated from th' reg'ment.&nbsp; I got shot,



<P>too."



<P>His friend had stepped forward quickly.



<P>"What?&nbsp; Got shot?&nbsp; Why didn't yeh say so



<P>first?&nbsp; Poor ol' boy, we must--hol' on a minnit;



<P>what am I doin'.&nbsp; I'll call Simpson."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Another figure at that moment loomed in the



<P>gloom.&nbsp; They could see that it was the corporal.



<P>"Who yeh talkin' to, Wilson?" he demanded.



<P>His voice was anger-toned.&nbsp; "Who yeh talkin'



<P>to?&nbsp; Yeh th' derndest sentinel--why--hello,



<P>Henry, you here?&nbsp; Why, I thought you was



<P>dead four hours ago!&nbsp; Great Jerusalem, they



<P>keep turnin' up every ten minutes or so!&nbsp; We



<P>thought we'd lost forty-two men by straight



<P>count, but if they keep on a-comin' this way, we'll



<P>git th' comp'ny all back by mornin' yit.&nbsp; Where



<P>was yeh?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Over on th' right.&nbsp; I got separated"--began



<P>the youth with considerable glibness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But his friend had interrupted hastily.&nbsp; "Yes,



<P>an' he got shot in th' head an' he's in a fix, an' we



<P>must see t' him right away."&nbsp; He rested his rifle



<P>in the hollow of his left arm and his right around



<P>the youth's shoulder.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Gee, it must hurt like thunder!" he said.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth leaned heavily upon his friend.



<P>"Yes, it hurts--hurts a good deal," he replied.



<P>There was a faltering in his voice.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh," said the corporal.&nbsp; He linked his arm



<P>in the youth's and drew him forward.&nbsp; "Come



<P>on, Henry.&nbsp; I'll take keer 'a yeh."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As they went on together the loud private



<P>called out after them: "Put 'im t' sleep in my



<P>blanket, Simpson.&nbsp; An'--hol' on a minnit--here's



<P>my canteen.&nbsp; It's full 'a coffee.&nbsp; Look at his head



<P>by th' fire an' see how it looks.&nbsp; Maybe it's a



<P>pretty bad un.&nbsp; When I git relieved in a couple



<P>'a minnits, I'll be over an' see t' him."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth's senses were so deadened that his



<P>friend's voice sounded from afar and he could



<P>scarcely feel the pressure of the corporal's arm.



<P>He submitted passively to the latter's directing



<P>strength.&nbsp; His head was in the old manner hang-



<P>ing forward upon his breast.&nbsp; His knees wobbled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The corporal led him into the glare of the



<P>fire.&nbsp; "Now, Henry," he said, "let's have look at



<P>yer ol' head."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth sat down obediently and the cor-



<P>poral, laying aside his rifle, began to fumble in the



<P>bushy hair of his comrade.&nbsp; He was obliged to



<P>turn the other's head so that the full flush of the



<P>fire light would beam upon it.&nbsp; He puckered his



<P>mouth with a critical air.&nbsp; He drew back his lips



<P>and whistled through his teeth when his fingers



<P>came in contact with the splashed blood and the



<P>rare wound.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, here we are!" he said.&nbsp; He awkwardly



<P>made further investigations.&nbsp; "Jest as I thought,"



<P>he added, presently.&nbsp; "Yeh've been grazed by a



<P>ball.&nbsp; It's raised a queer lump jest as if some



<P>feller had lammed yeh on th' head with a club.



<P>It stopped a-bleedin' long time ago.&nbsp; Th' most



<P>about it is that in th' mornin' yeh'll feel that a



<P>number ten hat wouldn't fit yeh.&nbsp; An' your



<P>head'll be all het up an' feel as dry as burnt pork.



<P>An' yeh may git a lot 'a other sicknesses, too, by



<P>mornin'.&nbsp; Yeh can't never tell.&nbsp; Still, I don't



<P>much think so.&nbsp; It's jest a damn' good belt on th'



<P>head, an' nothin' more.&nbsp; Now, you jest sit here



<P>an' don't move, while I go rout out th' relief.



<P>Then I'll send Wilson t' take keer 'a yeh."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The corporal went away.&nbsp; The youth re-



<P>mained on the ground like a parcel.&nbsp; He stared



<P>with a vacant look into the fire.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a time he aroused, for some part, and



<P>the things about him began to take form.&nbsp; He



<P>saw that the ground in the deep shadows was



<P>cluttered with men, sprawling in every con-



<P>ceivable posture.&nbsp; Glancing narrowly into the



<P>more distant darkness, he caught occasional



<P>glimpses of visages that loomed pallid and



<P>ghostly, lit with a phosphorescent glow.&nbsp; These



<P>faces expressed in their lines the deep stupor of



<P>the tired soldiers.&nbsp; They made them appear like



<P>men drunk with wine.&nbsp; This bit of forest might



<P>have appeared to an ethereal wanderer as a scene



<P>of the result of some frightful debauch.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On the other side of the fire the youth



<P>observed an officer asleep, seated bolt upright,



<P>with his back against a tree.&nbsp; There was some-



<P>thing perilous in his position.&nbsp; Badgered by



<P>dreams, perhaps, he swayed with little bounces



<P>and starts, like an old toddy-stricken grandfather



<P>in a chimney corner.&nbsp; Dust and stains were upon



<P>his face.&nbsp; His lower jaw hung down as if lacking



<P>strength to assume its normal position.&nbsp; He was



<P>the picture of an exhausted soldier after a feast of



<P>war.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had evidently gone to sleep with his



<P>sword in his arms.&nbsp; These two had slumbered in



<P>an embrace, but the weapon had been allowed



<P>in time to fall unheeded to the ground.&nbsp; The



<P>brass-mounted hilt lay in contact with some parts



<P>of the fire.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Within the gleam of rose and orange light



<P>from the burning sticks were other soldiers,



<P>snoring and heaving, or lying deathlike in



<P>slumber.&nbsp; A few pairs of legs were stuck forth,



<P>rigid and straight.&nbsp; The shoes displayed the mud



<P>or dust of marches and bits of rounded trousers,



<P>protruding from the blankets, showed rents and



<P>tears from hurried pitchings through the dense



<P>brambles.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The fire crackled musically.&nbsp; From it swelled



<P>light smoke.&nbsp; Overhead the foliage moved



<P>softly.&nbsp; The leaves, with their faces turned



<P>toward the blaze, were colored shifting hues of



<P>silver, often edged with red.&nbsp; Far off to the right,



<P>through a window in the forest could be seen a



<P>handful of stars lying, like glittering pebbles, on



<P>the black level of the night.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Occasionally, in this low-arched hall, a soldier



<P>would arouse and turn his body to a new posi-



<P>tion, the experience of his sleep having taught



<P>him of uneven and objectionable places upon the



<P>ground under him.&nbsp; Or, perhaps, he would lift



<P>himself to a sitting posture, blink at the fire for



<P>an unintelligent moment, throw a swift glance at



<P>his prostrate companion, and then cuddle down



<P>again with a grunt of sleepy content.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth sat in a forlorn heap until his



<P>friend the loud young soldier came, swinging two



<P>canteens by their light strings.&nbsp; "Well, now,



<P>Henry, ol' boy," said the latter, "we'll have yeh



<P>fixed up in jest about a minnit."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had the bustling ways of an amateur



<P>nurse.&nbsp; He fussed around the fire and stirred the



<P>sticks to brilliant exertions.&nbsp; He made his patient



<P>drink largely from the canteen that contained the



<P>coffee.&nbsp; It was to the youth a delicious draught.



<P>He tilted his head afar back and held the canteen



<P>long to his lips.&nbsp; The cool mixture went caress-



<P>ingly down his blistered throat.&nbsp; Having finished,



<P>he sighed with comfortable delight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The loud young soldier watched his comrade



<P>with an air of satisfaction.&nbsp; He later produced



<P>an extensive handkerchief from his pocket.&nbsp; He



<P>folded it into a manner of bandage and soused



<P>water from the other canteen upon the middle of



<P>it.&nbsp; This crude arrangement he bound over the



<P>youth's head, tying the ends in a queer knot at



<P>the back of the neck.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There," he said, moving off and surveying



<P>his deed, "yeh look like th' devil, but I bet yeh



<P>feel better."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth contemplated his friend with grate-



<P>ful eyes.&nbsp; Upon his aching and swelling head the



<P>cold cloth was like a tender woman's hand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yeh don't holler ner say nothin'," remarked



<P>his friend approvingly.&nbsp; "I know I'm a black-



<P>smith at takin' keer 'a sick folks, an' yeh never



<P>squeaked.&nbsp; Yer a good un, Henry.&nbsp; Most 'a men



<P>would a' been in th' hospital long ago.&nbsp; A shot in



<P>th' head ain't foolin' business."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth made no reply, but began to fumble



<P>with the buttons of his jacket.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, come, now," continued his friend,



<P>"come on.&nbsp; I must put yeh t' bed an' see that yeh



<P>git a good night's rest."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The other got carefully erect, and the loud



<P>young soldier led him among the sleeping forms



<P>lying in groups and rows.&nbsp; Presently he stooped



<P>and picked up his blankets.&nbsp; He spread the rubber



<P>one upon the ground and placed the woolen one



<P>about the youth's shoulders.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There now," he said, "lie down an' git some



<P>sleep."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth, with his manner of doglike obe-



<P>dience, got carefully down like a crone stoop-



<P>ing.&nbsp; He stretched out with a murmur of relief



<P>and comfort.&nbsp; The ground felt like the softest



<P>couch.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But of a sudden he ejaculated: "Hol' on a



<P>minnit!&nbsp; Where you goin' t' sleep?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His friend waved his hand impatiently.



<P>"Right down there by yeh."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, but hol' on a minnit," continued the



<P>youth.&nbsp; "What yeh goin' t' sleep in?&nbsp; I've got



<P>your--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The loud young soldier snarled: "Shet up



<P>an' go on t' sleep.&nbsp; Don't be makin' a damn' fool



<P>'a yerself," he said severely.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After the reproof the youth said no more.



<P>An exquisite drowsiness had spread through him.



<P>The warm comfort of the blanket enveloped him



<P>and made a gentle languor.&nbsp; His head fell for-



<P>ward on his crooked arm and his weighted lids



<P>went softly down over his eyes.&nbsp; Hearing a



<P>splatter of musketry from the distance, he



<P>wondered indifferently if those men sometimes



<P>slept.&nbsp; He gave a long sigh, snuggled down into



<P>his blanket, and in a moment was like his com-



<P>rades.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>THE youth cringed as if discovered in a crime.



<P>By heavens, they had won after all!&nbsp; The im-



<P>becile line had remained and become victors.



<P>He could hear cheering.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He lifted himself upon his toes and looked in



<P>the direction of the fight.&nbsp; A yellow fog lay wal-



<P>lowing on the treetops.&nbsp; From beneath it came



<P>the clatter of musketry.&nbsp; Hoarse cries told of an



<P>advance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He turned away amazed and angry.&nbsp; He felt



<P>that he had been wronged.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had fled, he told himself, because annihila-



<P>tion approached.&nbsp; He had done a good part in



<P>saving himself, who was a little piece of the army.



<P>He had considered the time, he said, to be one in



<P>which it was the duty of every little piece to res-



<P>cue itself if possible.&nbsp; Later the officers could fit



<P>the little pieces together again, and make a battle



<P>front.&nbsp; If none of the little pieces were wise enough



<P>to save themselves from the flurry of death at such



<P>a time, why, then, where would be the army?&nbsp; It



<P>was all plain that he had proceeded according to



<P>very correct and commendable rules.&nbsp; His ac-



<P>tions had been sagacious things.&nbsp; They had been



<P>full of strategy.&nbsp; They were the work of a mas-



<P>ter's legs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Thoughts of his comrades came to him.&nbsp; The



<P>brittle blue line had withstood the blows and won.



<P>He grew bitter over it.&nbsp; It seemed that the blind



<P>ignorance and stupidity of those little pieces had



<P>betrayed him.&nbsp; He had been overturned and



<P>crushed by their lack of sense in holding the po-



<P>sition, when intelligent deliberation would have



<P>convinced them that it was impossible.&nbsp; He, the



<P>enlightened man who looks afar in the dark, had



<P>fled because of his superior perceptions and



<P>knowledge.&nbsp; He felt a great anger against his



<P>comrades.&nbsp; He knew it could be proved that



<P>they had been fools.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He wondered what they would remark when



<P>later he appeared in camp.&nbsp; His mind heard



<P>howls of derision.&nbsp; Their density would not en-



<P>able them to understand his sharper point of



<P>view.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He began to pity himself acutely.&nbsp; He was



<P>ill used.&nbsp; He was trodden beneath the feet of an



<P>iron injustice.&nbsp; He had proceeded with wisdom



<P>and from the most righteous motives under



<P>heaven's blue only to be frustrated by hateful



<P>circumstances.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A dull, animal-like rebellion against his fel-



<P>lows, war in the abstract, and fate grew within



<P>him.&nbsp; He shambled along with bowed head, his



<P>brain in a tumult of agony and despair.&nbsp; When



<P>he looked loweringly up, quivering at each



<P>sound, his eyes had the expression of those of



<P>a criminal who thinks his guilt and his pun-



<P>ishment great, and knows that he can find no



<P>words.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He went from the fields into a thick woods, as



<P>if resolved to bury himself.&nbsp; He wished to get



<P>out of hearing of the crackling shots which were



<P>to him like voices.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The ground was cluttered with vines and



<P>bushes, and the trees grew close and spread out



<P>like bouquets.&nbsp; He was obliged to force his way



<P>with much noise.&nbsp; The creepers, catching against



<P>his legs, cried out harshly as their sprays were



<P>torn from the barks of trees.&nbsp; The swishing sap-



<P>lings tried to make known his presence to the



<P>world.&nbsp; He could not conciliate the forest.&nbsp; As



<P>he made his way, it was always calling out prot-



<P>estations.&nbsp; When he separated embraces of trees



<P>and vines the disturbed foliages waved their arms



<P>and turned their face leaves toward him.&nbsp; He



<P>dreaded lest these noisy motions and cries should



<P>bring men to look at him.&nbsp; So he went far, seek-



<P>ing dark and intricate places.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a time the sound of musketry grew faint



<P>and the cannon boomed in the distance.&nbsp; The sun,



<P>suddenly apparent, blazed among the trees.&nbsp; The



<P>insects were making rhythmical noises.&nbsp; They



<P>seemed to be grinding their teeth in unison.&nbsp; A



<P>woodpecker stuck his impudent head around the



<P>side of a tree.&nbsp; A bird flew on lighthearted wing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Off was the rumble of death.&nbsp; It seemed now



<P>that Nature had no ears.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This landscape gave him assurance.&nbsp; A fair



<P>field holding life.&nbsp; It was the religion of peace.



<P>It would die if its timid eyes were compelled to



<P>see blood.&nbsp; He conceived Nature to be a woman



<P>with a deep aversion to tragedy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He threw a pine cone at a jovial squirrel, and



<P>he ran with chattering fear.&nbsp; High in a treetop



<P>he stopped, and, poking his head cautiously from



<P>behind a branch, looked down with an air of trepi-



<P>dation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth felt triumphant at this exhibition.



<P>There was the law, he said.&nbsp; Nature had given



<P>him a sign.&nbsp; The squirrel, immediately upon rec-



<P>ognizing danger, had taken to his legs without



<P>ado.&nbsp; He did not stand stolidly baring his furry



<P>belly to the missile, and die with an upward



<P>glance at the sympathetic heavens.&nbsp; On the con-



<P>trary, he had fled as fast as his legs could carry



<P>him; and he was but an ordinary squirrel, too--



<P>doubtless no philosopher of his race.&nbsp; The youth



<P>wended, feeling that Nature was of his mind.



<P>She re-enforced his argument with proofs that



<P>lived where the sun shone.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Once he found himself almost into a swamp.



<P>He was obliged to walk upon bog tufts and



<P>watch his feet to keep from the oily mire.&nbsp; Paus-



<P>ing at one time to look about him he saw, out at



<P>some black water, a small animal pounce in and



<P>emerge directly with a gleaming fish.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth went again into the deep thickets.



<P>The brushed branches made a noise that drowned



<P>the sounds of cannon.&nbsp; He walked on, going from



<P>obscurity into promises of a greater obscurity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At length he reached a place where the high,



<P>arching boughs made a chapel.&nbsp; He softly pushed



<P>the green doors aside and entered.&nbsp; Pine needles



<P>were a gentle brown carpet.&nbsp; There was a reli-



<P>gious half light.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Near the threshold he stopped, horror-stricken



<P>at the sight of a thing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was being looked at by a dead man who



<P>was seated with his back against a columnlike



<P>tree.&nbsp; The corpse was dressed in a uniform that



<P>once had been blue, but was now faded to a mel-



<P>ancholy shade of green.&nbsp; The eyes, staring at the



<P>youth, had changed to the dull hue to be seen on



<P>the side of a dead fish.&nbsp; The mouth was open.



<P>Its red had changed to an appalling yellow.



<P>Over the gray skin of the face ran little ants.



<P>One was trundling some sort of a bundle along



<P>the upper lip.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth gave a shriek as he confronted the



<P>thing.&nbsp; He was for moments turned to stone be-



<P>fore it.&nbsp; He remained staring into the liquid-look-



<P>ing eyes.&nbsp; The dead man and the living man ex-



<P>changed a long look.&nbsp; Then the youth cautiously



<P>put one hand behind him and brought it against



<P>a tree.&nbsp; Leaning upon this he retreated, step by



<P>step, with his face still toward the thing.&nbsp; He



<P>feared that if he turned his back the body might



<P>spring up and stealthily pursue him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The branches, pushing against him, threat-



<P>ened to throw him over upon it.&nbsp; His unguided



<P>feet, too, caught aggravatingly in brambles; and



<P>with it all he received a subtle suggestion to



<P>touch the corpse.&nbsp; As he thought of his hand



<P>upon it he shuddered profoundly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At last he burst the bonds which had fastened



<P>him to the spot and fled, unheeding the under-



<P>brush.&nbsp; He was pursued by a sight of the black



<P>ants swarming greedily upon the gray face and



<P>venturing horribly near to the eyes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a time he paused, and, breathless and



<P>panting, listened.&nbsp; He imagined some strange



<P>voice would come from the dead throat and



<P>squawk after him in horrible menaces.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The trees about the portal of the chapel



<P>moved soughingly in a soft wind.&nbsp; A sad silence



<P>was upon the little guarding edifice.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>THE youth awakened slowly.&nbsp; He came grad-



<P>ually back to a position from which he could re-



<P>gard himself.&nbsp; For moments he had been scruti-



<P>nizing his person in a dazed way as if he had



<P>never before seen himself.&nbsp; Then he picked up



<P>his cap from the ground.&nbsp; He wriggled in his



<P>jacket to make a more comfortable fit, and kneel-



<P>ing relaced his shoe.&nbsp; He thoughtfully mopped



<P>his reeking features.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>So it was all over at last!&nbsp; The supreme trial



<P>had been passed.&nbsp; The red, formidable difficulties



<P>of war had been vanquished.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He went into an ecstasy of self-satisfaction.



<P>He had the most delightful sensations of his life.



<P>Standing as if apart from himself, he viewed that



<P>last scene.&nbsp; He perceived that the man who had



<P>fought thus was magnificent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He felt that he was a fine fellow.&nbsp; He saw



<P>himself even with those ideals which he had con-



<P>sidered as far beyond him.&nbsp; He smiled in deep



<P>gratification.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Upon his fellows he beamed tenderness and



<P>good will.&nbsp; "Gee! ain't it hot, hey?" he said



<P>affably to a man who was polishing his stream-



<P>ing face with his coat sleeves.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"You bet!" said the other, grinning sociably.



<P>"I never seen sech dumb hotness."&nbsp; He sprawled



<P>out luxuriously on the ground.&nbsp; "Gee, yes!&nbsp; An'



<P>I hope we don't have no more fightin' till a week



<P>from Monday."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There were some handshakings and deep



<P>speeches with men whose features were familiar,



<P>but with whom the youth now felt the bonds of



<P>tied hearts.&nbsp; He helped a cursing comrade to



<P>bind up a wound of the shin.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But, of a sudden, cries of amazement broke



<P>out along the ranks of the new regiment.&nbsp; "Here



<P>they come ag'in!&nbsp; Here they come ag'in!"&nbsp; The



<P>man who had sprawled upon the ground started



<P>up and said, "Gosh!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth turned quick eyes upon the field.



<P>He discerned forms begin to swell in masses out



<P>of a distant wood.&nbsp; He again saw the tilted flag



<P>speeding forward.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The shells, which had ceased to trouble the



<P>regiment for a time, came swirling again, and ex-



<P>ploded in the grass or among the leaves of the



<P>trees.&nbsp; They looked to be strange war flowers



<P>bursting into fierce bloom.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The men groaned.&nbsp; The luster faded from



<P>their eyes.&nbsp; Their smudged countenances now



<P>expressed a profound dejection.&nbsp; They moved



<P>their stiffened bodies slowly, and watched in sul-



<P>len mood the frantic approach of the enemy.&nbsp; The



<P>slaves toiling in the temple of this god began to



<P>feel rebellion at his harsh tasks.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They fretted and complained each to each.



<P>"Oh, say, this is too much of a good thing!&nbsp; Why



<P>can't somebody send us supports?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"We ain't never goin' to stand this second



<P>banging.&nbsp; I didn't come here to fight the hull



<P>damn' rebel army."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was one who raised a doleful cry.&nbsp; "I



<P>wish Bill Smithers had trod on my hand, in-



<P>steader me treddin' on his'n."&nbsp; The sore joints of



<P>the regiment creaked as it painfully floundered



<P>into position to repulse.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth stared.&nbsp; Surely, he thought, this



<P>impossible thing was not about to happen.&nbsp; He



<P>waited as if he expected the enemy to suddenly



<P>stop, apologize, and retire bowing.&nbsp; It was all a



<P>mistake.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But the firing began somewhere on the regi-



<P>mental line and ripped along in both directions.



<P>The level sheets of flame developed great clouds



<P>of smoke that tumbled and tossed in the mild



<P>wind near the ground for a moment, and then



<P>rolled through the ranks as through a gate.&nbsp; The



<P>clouds were tinged an earthlike yellow in the



<P>sunrays and in the shadow were a sorry blue.



<P>The flag was sometimes eaten and lost in this



<P>mass of vapor, but more often it projected, sun-



<P>touched, resplendent.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Into the youth's eyes there came a look that



<P>one can see in the orbs of a jaded horse.&nbsp; His



<P>neck was quivering with nervous weakness and



<P>the muscles of his arms felt numb and bloodless.



<P>His hands, too, seemed large and awkward as if



<P>he was wearing invisible mittens.&nbsp; And there was



<P>a great uncertainty about his knee joints.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The words that comrades had uttered previous



<P>to the firing began to recur to him.&nbsp; "Oh, say,



<P>this is too much of a good thing!&nbsp; What do they



<P>take us for--why don't they send supports?&nbsp; I



<P>didn't come here to fight the hull damned rebel



<P>army."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He began to exaggerate the endurance, the



<P>skill, and the valor of those who were coming.



<P>Himself reeling from exhaustion, he was aston-



<P>ished beyond measure at such persistency.&nbsp; They



<P>must be machines of steel.&nbsp; It was very gloomy



<P>struggling against such affairs, wound up perhaps



<P>to fight until sundown.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He slowly lifted his rifle and catching a



<P>glimpse of the thickspread field he blazed at a



<P>cantering cluster.&nbsp; He stopped then and began



<P>to peer as best he could through the smoke.&nbsp; He



<P>caught changing views of the ground covered



<P>with men who were all running like pursued



<P>imps, and yelling.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To the youth it was an onslaught of redoubt-



<P>able dragons.&nbsp; He became like the man who lost



<P>his legs at the approach of the red and green



<P>monster.&nbsp; He waited in a sort of a horrified,



<P>listening attitude.&nbsp; He seemed to shut his eyes



<P>and wait to be gobbled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A man near him who up to this time had been



<P>working feverishly at his rifle suddenly stopped



<P>and ran with howls.&nbsp; A lad whose face had borne



<P>an expression of exalted courage, the majesty of



<P>he who dares give his life, was, at an instant,



<P>smitten abject.&nbsp; He blanched like one who has



<P>come to the edge of a cliff at midnight and is sud-



<P>denly made aware.&nbsp; There was a revelation.&nbsp; He,



<P>too, threw down his gun and fled.&nbsp; There was no



<P>shame in his face.&nbsp; He ran like a rabbit.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Others began to scamper away through the



<P>smoke.&nbsp; The youth turned his head, shaken from



<P>his trance by this movement as if the regiment



<P>was leaving him behind.&nbsp; He saw the few fleeting



<P>forms.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He yelled then with fright and swung about.



<P>For a moment, in the great clamor, he was like a



<P>proverbial chicken.&nbsp; He lost the direction of



<P>safety.&nbsp; Destruction threatened him from all



<P>points.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Directly he began to speed toward the rear in



<P>great leaps.&nbsp; His rifle and cap were gone.&nbsp; His



<P>unbuttoned coat bulged in the wind.&nbsp; The flap of



<P>his cartridge box bobbed wildly, and his canteen,



<P>by its slender cord, swung out behind.&nbsp; On his



<P>face was all the horror of those things which he



<P>imagined.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The lieutenant sprang forward bawling.&nbsp; The



<P>youth saw his features wrathfully red, and saw



<P>him make a dab with his sword.&nbsp; His one thought



<P>of the incident was that the lieutenant was a pecul-



<P>iar creature to feel interested in such matters



<P>upon this occasion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He ran like a blind man.&nbsp; Two or three times



<P>he fell down.&nbsp; Once he knocked his shoulder so



<P>heavily against a tree that he went headlong.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Since he had turned his back upon the fight



<P>his fears had been wondrously magnified.&nbsp; Death



<P>about to thrust him between the shoulder blades



<P>was far more dreadful than death about to smite



<P>him between the eyes.&nbsp; When he thought of it



<P>later, he conceived the impression that it is better



<P>to view the appalling than to be merely within



<P>hearing.&nbsp; The noises of the battle were like



<P>stones; he believed himself liable to be crushed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As he ran he mingled with others.&nbsp; He



<P>dimly saw men on his right and on his left, and



<P>he heard footsteps behind him.&nbsp; He thought that



<P>all the regiment was fleeing, pursued by these



<P>ominous crashes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In his flight the sound of these following foot-



<P>steps gave him his one meager relief.&nbsp; He felt



<P>vaguely that death must make a first choice of



<P>the men who were nearest; the initial morsels for



<P>the dragons would be then those who were fol-



<P>lowing him.&nbsp; So he displayed the zeal of an insane



<P>sprinter in his purpose to keep them in the rear.



<P>There was a race.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As he, leading, went across a little field, he



<P>found himself in a region of shells.&nbsp; They hurtled



<P>over his head with long wild screams.&nbsp; As he



<P>listened he imagined them to have rows of cruel



<P>teeth that grinned at him.&nbsp; Once one lit before



<P>him and the livid lightning of the explosion



<P>effectually barred the way in his chosen direc-



<P>tion.&nbsp; He groveled on the ground and then



<P>springing up went careering off through some



<P>bushes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He experienced a thrill of amazement when



<P>he came within view of a battery in action.&nbsp; The



<P>men there seemed to be in conventional moods,



<P>altogether unaware of the impending annihila-



<P>tion.&nbsp; The battery was disputing with a distant



<P>antagonist and the gunners were wrapped in



<P>admiration of their shooting.&nbsp; They were con-



<P>tinually bending in coaxing postures over the



<P>guns.&nbsp; They seemed to be patting them on the



<P>back and encouraging them with words.&nbsp; The



<P>guns, stolid and undaunted, spoke with dogged



<P>valor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The precise gunners were coolly enthusiastic.



<P>They lifted their eyes every chance to the smoke-



<P>wreathed hillock from whence the hostile battery



<P>addressed them.&nbsp; The youth pitied them as he



<P>ran.&nbsp; Methodical idiots!&nbsp; Machine-like fools!&nbsp; The



<P>refined joy of planting shells in the midst of the



<P>other battery's formation would appear a little



<P>thing when the infantry came swooping out of



<P>the woods.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The face of a youthful rider, who was jerking



<P>his frantic horse with an abandon of temper



<P>he might display in a placid barnyard, was im-



<P>pressed deeply upon his mind.&nbsp; He knew that



<P>he looked upon a man who would presently be



<P>dead.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Too, he felt a pity for the guns, standing, six



<P>good comrades, in a bold row.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He saw a brigade going to the relief of its pes-



<P>tered fellows.&nbsp; He scrambled upon a wee hill and



<P>watched it sweeping finely, keeping formation in



<P>difficult places.&nbsp; The blue of the line was crusted



<P>with steel color, and the brilliant flags projected.



<P>Officers were shouting.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This sight also filled him with wonder.&nbsp; The



<P>brigade was hurrying briskly to be gulped into



<P>the infernal mouths of the war god.&nbsp; What man-



<P>ner of men were they, anyhow?&nbsp; Ah, it was some



<P>wondrous breed!&nbsp; Or else they didn't compre-



<P>hend--the fools.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A furious order caused commotion in the artil-



<P>lery.&nbsp; An officer on a bounding horse made mani-



<P>acal motions with his arms.&nbsp; The teams went



<P>swinging up from the rear, the guns were whirled



<P>about, and the battery scampered away.&nbsp; The



<P>cannon with their noses poked slantingly at the



<P>ground grunted and grumbled like stout men,



<P>brave but with objections to hurry.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth went on, moderating his pace since



<P>he had left the place of noises.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Later he came upon a general of division



<P>seated upon a horse that pricked its ears in



<P>an interested way at the battle.&nbsp; There was a



<P>great gleaming of yellow and patent leather



<P>about the saddle and bridle.&nbsp; The quiet man



<P>astride looked mouse-colored upon such a splen-



<P>did charger.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A jingling staff was galloping hither and



<P>thither.&nbsp; Sometimes the general was surrounded



<P>by horsemen and at other times he was quite



<P>alone.&nbsp; He looked to be much harassed.&nbsp; He had



<P>the appearance of a business man whose market



<P>is swinging up and down.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth went slinking around this spot.



<P>He went as near as he dared trying to overhear



<P>words.&nbsp; Perhaps the general, unable to compre-



<P>hend chaos, might call upon him for information.



<P>And he could tell him.&nbsp; He knew all concerning



<P>it.&nbsp; Of a surety the force was in a fix, and any



<P>fool could see that if they did not retreat while



<P>they had opportunity--why--

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He felt that he would like to thrash the gen-



<P>eral, or at least approach and tell him in plain



<P>words exactly what he thought him to be.&nbsp; It



<P>was criminal to stay calmly in one spot and make



<P>no effort to stay destruction.&nbsp; He loitered in a



<P>fever of eagerness for the division commander to



<P>apply to him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As he warily moved about, he heard the gen-



<P>eral call out irritably: "Tompkins, go over an'



<P>see Taylor, an' tell him not t' be in such an all-



<P>fired hurry; tell him t' halt his brigade in th'



<P>edge of th' woods; tell him t' detach a reg'ment



<P>--say I think th' center 'll break if we don't help



<P>it out some; tell him t' hurry up."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A slim youth on a fine chestnut horse caught



<P>these swift words from the mouth of his superior.



<P>He made his horse bound into a gallop almost



<P>from a walk in his haste to go upon his mission.



<P>There was a cloud of dust.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A moment later the youth saw the general



<P>bounce excitedly in his saddle.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, by heavens, they have!"&nbsp; The officer



<P>leaned forward.&nbsp; His face was aflame with excite-



<P>ment.&nbsp; "Yes, by heavens, they 've held 'im!



<P>They 've held 'im!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He began to blithely roar at his staff: "We 'll



<P>wallop 'im now.&nbsp; We 'll wallop 'im now.&nbsp; We 've



<P>got 'em sure."&nbsp; He turned suddenly upon an aid:



<P>"Here--you--Jones--quick--ride after Tompkins



<P>--see Taylor--tell him t' go in--everlastingly--



<P>like blazes--anything."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As another officer sped his horse after the first



<P>messenger, the general beamed upon the earth



<P>like a sun.&nbsp; In his eyes was a desire to chant a



<P>paean.&nbsp; He kept repeating, "They 've held 'em,



<P>by heavens!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His excitement made his horse plunge, and he



<P>merrily kicked and swore at it.&nbsp; He held a little



<P>carnival of joy on horseback.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>THE column that had butted stoutly at the



<P>obstacles in the roadway was barely out of the



<P>youth's sight before he saw dark waves of men



<P>come sweeping out of the woods and down



<P>through the fields.&nbsp; He knew at once that the



<P>steel fibers had been washed from their hearts.



<P>They were bursting from their coats and



<P>their equipments as from entanglements.&nbsp; They



<P>charged down upon him like terrified buffaloes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Behind them blue smoke curled and clouded



<P>above the treetops, and through the thickets he



<P>could sometimes see a distant pink glare.&nbsp; The



<P>voices of the cannon were clamoring in intermi-



<P>nable chorus.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth was horrorstricken.&nbsp; He stared



<P>in agony and amazement.&nbsp; He forgot that he



<P>was engaged in combating the universe.&nbsp; He



<P>threw aside his mental pamphlets on the philoso-



<P>phy of the retreated and rules for the guidance



<P>of the damned.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>118

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The fight was lost.&nbsp; The dragons were com-



<P>ing with invincible strides.&nbsp; The army, helpless



<P>in the matted thickets and blinded by the over-



<P>hanging night, was going to be swallowed.&nbsp; War,



<P>the red animal, war, the blood-swollen god, would



<P>have bloated fill.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Within him something bade to cry out.&nbsp; He



<P>had the impulse to make a rallying speech, to sing



<P>a battle hymn, but he could only get his tongue to



<P>call into the air: "Why--why--what--what 's



<P>th' matter?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Soon he was in the midst of them.&nbsp; They



<P>were leaping and scampering all about him.



<P>Their blanched faces shone in the dusk.&nbsp; They



<P>seemed, for the most part, to be very burly men.



<P>The youth turned from one to another of them as



<P>they galloped along.&nbsp; His incoherent questions



<P>were lost.&nbsp; They were heedless of his appeals.



<P>They did not seem to see him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They sometimes gabbled insanely.&nbsp; One huge



<P>man was asking of the sky: "Say, where de



<P>plank road?&nbsp; Where de plank road!"&nbsp; It was as if



<P>he had lost a child.&nbsp; He wept in his pain and



<P>dismay.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Presently, men were running hither and



<P>thither in all ways.&nbsp; The artillery booming,



<P>forward, rearward, and on the flanks made



<P>jumble of ideas of direction.&nbsp; Landmarks had



<P>vanished into the gathered gloom.&nbsp; The youth



<P>began to imagine that he had got into the



<P>center of the tremendous quarrel, and he could



<P>perceive no way out of it.&nbsp; From the mouths of



<P>the fleeing men came a thousand wild questions,



<P>but no one made answers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth, after rushing about and throwing



<P>interrogations at the heedless bands of retreating



<P>infantry, finally clutched a man by the arm.&nbsp; They



<P>swung around face to face.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why--why--" stammered the youth strug-



<P>gling with his balking tongue.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The man screamed: "Let go me!&nbsp; Let go



<P>me!"&nbsp; His face was livid and his eyes were roll-



<P>ing uncontrolled.&nbsp; He was heaving and panting.



<P>He still grasped his rifle, perhaps having for-



<P>gotten to release his hold upon it.&nbsp; He tugged



<P>frantically, and the youth being compelled to lean



<P>forward was dragged several paces.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Let go me!&nbsp; Let go me!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why--why--" stuttered the youth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, then!" bawled the man in a lurid



<P>rage.&nbsp; He adroitly and fiercely swung his rifle.



<P>It crushed upon the youth's head.&nbsp; The man



<P>ran on.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth's fingers had turned to paste upon



<P>the other's arm.&nbsp; The energy was smitten from



<P>his muscles.&nbsp; He saw the flaming wings of light-



<P>ning flash before his vision.&nbsp; There was a deaf-



<P>ening rumble of thunder within his head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Suddenly his legs seemed to die.&nbsp; He sank



<P>writhing to the ground.&nbsp; He tried to arise.&nbsp; In



<P>his efforts against the numbing pain he was like a



<P>man wrestling with a creature of the air.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a sinister struggle.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Sometimes he would achieve a position half



<P>erect, battle with the air for a moment, and



<P>then fall again, grabbing at the grass.&nbsp; His face



<P>was of a clammy pallor.&nbsp; Deep groans were



<P>wrenched from him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At last, with a twisting movement, he got



<P>upon his hands and knees, and from thence, like a



<P>babe trying to walk, to his feet.&nbsp; Pressing his



<P>hands to his temples he went lurching over the



<P>grass.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He fought an intense battle with his body.



<P>His dulled senses wished him to swoon and he



<P>opposed them stubbornly, his mind portraying



<P>unknown dangers and mutilations if he should



<P>fall upon the field.&nbsp; He went tall soldier fashion.



<P>He imagined secluded spots where he could fall



<P>and be unmolested.&nbsp; To search for one he strove



<P>against the tide of his pain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Once he put his hand to the top of his head



<P>and timidly touched the wound.&nbsp; The scratching



<P>pain of the contact made him draw a long breath



<P>through his clinched teeth.&nbsp; His fingers were



<P>dabbled with blood.&nbsp; He regarded them with a



<P>fixed stare.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Around him he could hear the grumble of



<P>jolted cannon as the scurrying horses were lashed



<P>toward the front.&nbsp; Once, a young officer on a



<P>besplashed charger nearly ran him down.&nbsp; He



<P>turned and watched the mass of guns, men, and



<P>horses sweeping in a wide curve toward a gap in



<P>a fence.&nbsp; The officer was making excited motions



<P>with a gauntleted hand.&nbsp; The guns followed the



<P>teams with an air of unwillingness, of being



<P>dragged by the heels.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Some officers of the scattered infantry were



<P>cursing and railing like fishwives.&nbsp; Their scold-



<P>ing voices could be heard above the din.&nbsp; Into



<P>the unspeakable jumble in the roadway rode a



<P>squadron of cavalry.&nbsp; The faded yellow of their



<P>facings shone bravely.&nbsp; There was a mighty



<P>altercation.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The artillery were assembling as if for a con-



<P>ference.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The blue haze of evening was upon the field.



<P>The lines of forest were long purple shadows.



<P>One cloud lay along the western sky partly



<P>smothering the red.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As the youth left the scene behind him, he



<P>heard the guns suddenly roar out.&nbsp; He imagined



<P>them shaking in black rage.&nbsp; They belched and



<P>howled like brass devils guarding a gate.&nbsp; The



<P>soft air was filled with the tremendous remon-



<P>strance.&nbsp; With it came the shattering peal of



<P>opposing infantry.&nbsp; Turning to look behind him,



<P>he could see sheets of orange light illumine the



<P>shadowy distance.&nbsp; There were subtle and sudden



<P>lightnings in the far air.&nbsp; At times he thought he



<P>could see heaving masses of men.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He hurried on in the dusk.&nbsp; The day had



<P>faded until he could barely distinguish place for



<P>his feet.&nbsp; The purple darkness was filled with



<P>men who lectured and jabbered.&nbsp; Sometimes he



<P>could see them gesticulating against the blue and



<P>somber sky.&nbsp; There seemed to be a great ruck of



<P>men and munitions spread about in the forest and



<P>in the fields.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The little narrow roadway now lay lifeless.



<P>There were overturned wagons like sun-dried



<P>bowlders.&nbsp; The bed of the former torrent was



<P>choked with the bodies of horses and splintered



<P>parts of war machines.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It had come to pass that his wound pained him



<P>but little.&nbsp; He was afraid to move rapidly, how-



<P>ever, for a dread of disturbing it.&nbsp; He held his



<P>head very still and took many precautions against



<P>stumbling.&nbsp; He was filled with anxiety, and his



<P>face was pinched and drawn in anticipation of the



<P>pain of any sudden mistake of his feet in the



<P>gloom.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His thoughts, as he walked, fixed intently



<P>upon his hurt.&nbsp; There was a cool, liquid feeling



<P>about it and he imagined blood moving slowly



<P>down under his hair.&nbsp; His head seemed swollen



<P>to a size that made him think his neck to be



<P>inadequate.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The new silence of his wound made much



<P>worriment.&nbsp; The little blistering voices of pain



<P>that had called out from his scalp were, he



<P>thought, definite in their expression of danger.



<P>By them he believed that he could measure his



<P>plight.&nbsp; But when they remained ominously



<P>silent he became frightened and imagined ter-



<P>rible fingers that clutched into his brain.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Amid it he began to reflect upon various



<P>incidents and conditions of the past.&nbsp; He be-



<P>thought him of certain meals his mother had



<P>cooked at home, in which those dishes of which



<P>he was particularly fond had occupied prominent



<P>positions.&nbsp; He saw the spread table.&nbsp; The pine



<P>walls of the kitchen were glowing in the warm



<P>light from the stove.&nbsp; Too, he remembered how



<P>he and his companions used to go from the school-



<P>house to the bank of a shaded pool.&nbsp; He saw his



<P>clothes in disorderly array upon the grass of the



<P>bank.&nbsp; He felt the swash of the fragrant water



<P>upon his body.&nbsp; The leaves of the overhanging



<P>maple rustled with melody in the wind of youth-



<P>ful summer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was overcome presently by a dragging



<P>weariness.&nbsp; His head hung forward and his



<P>shoulders were stooped as if he were bearing a



<P>great bundle.&nbsp; His feet shuffled along the



<P>ground.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He held continuous arguments as to whether



<P>he should lie down and sleep at some near spot,



<P>or force himself on until he reached a certain



<P>haven.&nbsp; He often tried to dismiss the question,



<P>but his body persisted in rebellion and his senses



<P>nagged at him like pampered babies.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At last he heard a cheery voice near his



<P>shoulder: "Yeh seem t' be in a pretty bad way,



<P>boy?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth did not look up, but he assented



<P>with thick tongue.&nbsp; "Uh!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The owner of the cheery voice took him firmly



<P>by the arm.&nbsp; "Well," he said, with a round



<P>laugh, "I'm goin' your way.&nbsp; Th' hull gang is



<P>goin' your way.&nbsp; An' I guess I kin give yeh a



<P>lift."&nbsp; They began to walk like a drunken man



<P>and his friend.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As they went along, the man questioned the



<P>youth and assisted him with the replies like one



<P>manipulating the mind of a child.&nbsp; Sometimes he



<P>interjected anecdotes.&nbsp; "What reg'ment do yeh



<P>b'long teh?&nbsp; Eh?&nbsp; What's that?&nbsp; Th' 304th N'



<P>York?&nbsp; Why, what corps is that in?&nbsp; Oh, it is?



<P>Why, I thought they wasn't engaged t'-day--



<P>they 're 'way over in th' center.&nbsp; Oh, they was,



<P>eh?&nbsp; Well, pretty nearly everybody got their



<P>share 'a fightin' t'-day.&nbsp; By dad, I give myself up



<P>fer dead any number 'a times.&nbsp; There was shootin'



<P>here an' shootin' there, an' hollerin' here an'



<P>hollerin' there, in th' damn' darkness, until I



<P>couldn't tell t' save m' soul which side I was on.



<P>Sometimes I thought I was sure 'nough from



<P>Ohier, an' other times I could 'a swore I was



<P>from th' bitter end of Florida.&nbsp; It was th' most



<P>mixed up dern thing I ever see.&nbsp; An' these here



<P>hull woods is a reg'lar mess.&nbsp; It'll be a miracle



<P>if we find our reg'ments t'-night.&nbsp; Pretty soon,



<P>though, we 'll meet a-plenty of guards an' provost-



<P>guards, an' one thing an' another.&nbsp; Ho! there they



<P>go with an off'cer, I guess.&nbsp; Look at his hand



<P>a-draggin'.&nbsp; He 's got all th' war he wants, I bet.



<P>He won't be talkin' so big about his reputation



<P>an' all when they go t' sawin' off his leg.&nbsp; Poor



<P>feller!&nbsp; My brother 's got whiskers jest like that.



<P>How did yeh git 'way over here, anyhow?&nbsp; Your



<P>reg'ment is a long way from here, ain't it?&nbsp; Well,



<P>I guess we can find it.&nbsp; Yeh know there was a



<P>boy killed in my comp'ny t'-day that I thought



<P>th' world an' all of.&nbsp; Jack was a nice feller.&nbsp; By



<P>ginger, it hurt like thunder t' see ol' Jack jest git



<P>knocked flat.&nbsp; We was a-standin' purty peaceable



<P>fer a spell, 'though there was men runnin' ev'ry



<P>way all 'round us, an' while we was a-standin'



<P>like that, 'long come a big fat feller.&nbsp; He began



<P>t' peck at Jack's elbow, an' he ses: 'Say, where 's



<P>th' road t' th' river?'&nbsp; An' Jack, he never paid no



<P>attention, an' th' feller kept on a-peckin' at his



<P>elbow an' sayin': 'Say, where 's th' road t' th'



<P>river?'&nbsp; Jack was a-lookin' ahead all th' time



<P>tryin' t' see th' Johnnies comin' through th'



<P>woods, an' he never paid no attention t' this big



<P>fat feller fer a long time, but at last he turned



<P>'round an' he ses: 'Ah, go t' hell an' find th'



<P>road t' th' river!'&nbsp; An' jest then a shot slapped



<P>him bang on th' side th' head.&nbsp; He was a sergeant,



<P>too.&nbsp; Them was his last words.&nbsp; Thunder, I wish



<P>we was sure 'a findin' our reg'ments t'-night.&nbsp; It 's



<P>goin' t' be long huntin'.&nbsp; But I guess we kin



<P>do it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the search which followed, the man of the



<P>cheery voice seemed to the youth to possess a



<P>wand of a magic kind.&nbsp; He threaded the mazes



<P>of the tangled forest with a strange fortune.&nbsp; In



<P>encounters with guards and patrols he displayed



<P>the keenness of a detective and the valor of a



<P>gamin.&nbsp; Obstacles fell before him and became of



<P>assistance.&nbsp; The youth, with his chin still on his



<P>breast, stood woodenly by while his companion



<P>beat ways and means out of sullen things.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The forest seemed a vast hive of men buzzing



<P>about in frantic circles, but the cheery man con-



<P>ducted the youth without mistakes, until at last



<P>he began to chuckle with glee and self-satisfaction.



<P>"Ah, there yeh are!&nbsp; See that fire?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth nodded stupidly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, there 's where your reg'ment is.&nbsp; An'



<P>now, good-by, ol' boy, good luck t' yeh."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A warm and strong hand clasped the youth's



<P>languid fingers for an instant, and then he heard



<P>a cheerful and audacious whistling as the man



<P>strode away.&nbsp; As he who had so befriended him



<P>was thus passing out of his life, it suddenly oc-



<P>curred to the youth that he had not once seen his



<P>face.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>THE brigade was halted in the fringe of a



<P>grove.&nbsp; The men crouched among the trees and



<P>pointed their restless guns out at the fields.



<P>They tried to look beyond the smoke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Out of this haze they could see running men.



<P>Some shouted information and gestured as they



<P>hurried.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The men of the new regiment watched and



<P>listened eagerly, while their tongues ran on in



<P>gossip of the battle.&nbsp; They mouthed rumors that



<P>had flown like birds out of the unknown.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They say Perry has been driven in with big



<P>loss."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, Carrott went t' th' hospital.&nbsp; He said he



<P>was sick.&nbsp; That smart lieutenant is commanding



<P>'G' Company.&nbsp; Th' boys say they won't be



<P>under Carrott no more if they all have t' desert.



<P>They allus knew he was a--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hannises' batt'ry is took."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It ain't either.&nbsp; I saw Hannises' batt'ry off on



<P>th' left not more'n fifteen minutes ago."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>47

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Th' general, he ses he is goin' t' take th' hull



<P>cammand of th' 304th when we go inteh action,



<P>an' then he ses we'll do sech fightin' as never



<P>another one reg'ment done."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"They say we're catchin' it over on th' left.



<P>They say th' enemy driv' our line inteh a devil of



<P>a swamp an' took Hannises' batt'ry."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No sech thing.&nbsp; Hannises' batt'ry was 'long



<P>here 'bout a minute ago."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That young Hasbrouck, he makes a good



<P>off'cer.&nbsp; He ain't afraid 'a nothin'."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I met one of th' 148th Maine boys an' he ses



<P>his brigade fit th' hull rebel army fer four hours



<P>over on th' turnpike road an' killed about five



<P>thousand of 'em.&nbsp; He ses one more sech fight as



<P>that an' th' war 'll be over."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Bill wasn't scared either.&nbsp; No, sir!&nbsp; It wasn't



<P>that.&nbsp; Bill ain't a-gittin' scared easy.&nbsp; He was



<P>jest mad, that's what he was.&nbsp; When that feller



<P>trod on his hand, he up an' sed that he was willin'



<P>t' give his hand t' his country, but he be dumbed



<P>if he was goin' t' have every dumb bushwhacker



<P>in th' kentry walkin' 'round on it.&nbsp; Se he went t'



<P>th' hospital disregardless of th' fight.&nbsp; Three



<P>fingers was crunched.&nbsp; Th' dern doctor wanted



<P>t' amputate 'm, an' Bill, he raised a heluva row, I



<P>hear.&nbsp; He's a funny feller."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The din in front swelled to a tremendous



<P>chorus.&nbsp; The youth and his fellows were frozen



<P>to silence.&nbsp; They could see a flag that tossed in



<P>the smoke angrily.&nbsp; Near it were the blurred and



<P>agitated forms of troops.&nbsp; There came a turbulent



<P>stream of men across the fields.&nbsp; A battery chang-



<P>ing position at a frantic gallop scattered the



<P>stragglers right and left.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A shell screaming like a storm banshee went



<P>over the huddled heads of the reserves.&nbsp; It landed



<P>in the grove, and exploding redly flung the brown



<P>earth.&nbsp; There was a little shower of pine needles.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Bullets began to whistle among the branches



<P>and nip at the trees.&nbsp; Twigs and leaves came



<P>sailing down.&nbsp; It was as if a thousand axes, wee



<P>and invisible, were being wielded.&nbsp; Many of the



<P>men were constantly dodging and ducking their



<P>heads.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The lieutenant of the youth's company was



<P>shot in the hand.&nbsp; He began to swear so won-



<P>drously that a nervous laugh went along the regi-



<P>mental line.&nbsp; The officer's profanity sounded



<P>conventional.&nbsp; It relieved the tightened senses of



<P>the new men.&nbsp; It was as if he had hit his fingers



<P>with a tack hammer at home.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He held the wounded member carefully away



<P>from his side so that the blood would not drip



<P>upon his trousers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The captain of the company, tucking his sword



<P>under his arm, produced a handkerchief and



<P>began to bind with it the lieutenant's wound.



<P>And they disputed as to how the binding should



<P>be done.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The battle flag in the distance jerked about



<P>madly.&nbsp; It seemed to be struggling to free itself



<P>from an agony.&nbsp; The billowing smoke was filled



<P>with horizontal flashes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Men running swiftly emerged from it.&nbsp; They



<P>grew in numbers until it was seen that the whole



<P>command was fleeing.&nbsp; The flag suddenly sank



<P>down as if dying.&nbsp; Its motion as it fell was a



<P>gesture of despair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Wild yells came from behind the walls of



<P>smoke.&nbsp; A sketch in gray and red dissolved into



<P>a moblike body of men who galloped like wild



<P>horses.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The veteran regiments on the right and left of



<P>the 304th immediately began to jeer.&nbsp; With the



<P>passionate song of the bullets and the banshee



<P>shrieks of shells were mingled loud catcalls and



<P>bits of facetious advice concerning places of safety.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But the new regiment was breathless with hor-



<P>ror.&nbsp; "Gawd!&nbsp; Saunders's got crushed!" whis-



<P>pered the man at the youth's elbow.&nbsp; They



<P>shrank back and crouched as if compelled to



<P>await a flood.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth shot a swift glance along the blue



<P>ranks of the regiment.&nbsp; The profiles were motion-



<P>less, carven; and afterward he remembered that



<P>the color sergeant was standing with his legs



<P>apart, as if he expected to be pushed to the



<P>ground.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The following throng went whirling around



<P>the flank.&nbsp; Here and there were officers carried



<P>along on the stream like exasperated chips.&nbsp; They



<P>were striking about them with their swords



<P>and with their left fists, punching every head



<P>they could reach.&nbsp; They cursed like highway-



<P>men.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A mounted officer displayed the furious anger



<P>of a spoiled child.&nbsp; He raged with his head, his



<P>arms, and his legs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Another, the commander of the brigade, was



<P>galloping about bawling.&nbsp; His hat was gone and



<P>his clothes were awry.&nbsp; He resembled a man



<P>who has come from bed to go to a fire.&nbsp; The



<P>hoofs of his horse often threatened the heads of



<P>the running men, but they scampered with sin-



<P>gular fortune.&nbsp; In this rush they were apparently



<P>all deaf and blind.&nbsp; They heeded not the largest



<P>and longest of the oaths that were thrown at



<P>them from all directions.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Frequently over this tumult could be heard



<P>the grim jokes of the critical veterans; but the



<P>retreating men apparently were not even con-



<P>scious of the presence of an audience.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The battle reflection that shone for an instant



<P>in the faces on the mad current made the youth



<P>feel that forceful hands from heaven would not



<P>have been able to have held him in place if he



<P>could have got intelligent control of his legs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was an appalling imprint upon these



<P>faces.&nbsp; The struggle in the smoke had pictured



<P>an exaggeration of itself on the bleached cheeks



<P>and in the eyes wild with one desire.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The sight of this stampede exerted a floodlike



<P>force that seemed able to drag sticks and stones



<P>and men from the ground.&nbsp; They of the reserves



<P>had to hold on.&nbsp; They grew pale and firm, and



<P>red and quaking.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth achieved one little thought in the



<P>midst of this chaos.&nbsp; The composite monster



<P>which had caused the other troops to flee had



<P>not then appeared.&nbsp; He resolved to get a view



<P>of it, and then, he thought he might very likely



<P>run better than the best of them.

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>THE tattered man stood musing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, he was reg'lar jim-dandy fer nerve,



<P>wa'n't he," said he finally in a little awestruck



<P>voice.&nbsp; "A reg'lar jim-dandy."&nbsp; He thoughtfully



<P>poked one of the docile hands with his foot.&nbsp; "I



<P>wonner where he got 'is stren'th from?&nbsp; I never



<P>seen a man do like that before.&nbsp; It was a funny



<P>thing.&nbsp; Well, he was a reg'lar jim-dandy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth desired to screech out his grief.



<P>He was stabbed, but his tongue lay dead in the



<P>tomb of his mouth.&nbsp; He threw himself again



<P>upon the ground and began to brood.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The tattered man stood musing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Look-a-here, pardner," he said, after a time.



<P>He regarded the corpse as he spoke.&nbsp; "He 's up



<P>an' gone, ain't 'e, an' we might as well begin t'



<P>look out fer ol' number one.&nbsp; This here thing is



<P>all over.&nbsp; He 's up an' gone, ain't 'e?&nbsp; An' he 's all



<P>right here.&nbsp; Nobody won't bother 'im.&nbsp; An' I



<P>must say I ain't enjoying any great health m'self



<P>these days."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth, awakened by the tattered soldier's



<P>tone, looked quickly up.&nbsp; He saw that he was



<P>swinging uncertainly on his legs and that his face



<P>had turned to a shade of blue.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Good Lord!" he cried, "you ain't goin' t'--



<P>not you, too."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The tattered man waved his hand.&nbsp; "Nary



<P>die," he said.&nbsp; "All I want is some pea soup an'



<P>a good bed.&nbsp; Some pea soup," he repeated



<P>dreamfully.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth arose from the ground.&nbsp; "I wonder



<P>where he came from.&nbsp; I left him over there."



<P>He pointed.&nbsp; "And now I find 'im here.&nbsp; And



<P>he was coming from over there, too."&nbsp; He in-



<P>dicated a new direction.&nbsp; They both turned



<P>toward the body as if to ask of it a question.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well," at length spoke the tattered man,



<P>"there ain't no use in our stayin' here an' tryin' t'



<P>ask him anything."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth nodded an assent wearily.&nbsp; They



<P>both turned to gaze for a moment at the corpse.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth murmured something.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, he was a jim-dandy, wa'n't 'e?" said



<P>the tattered man as if in response.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They turned their backs upon it and started



<P>away.&nbsp; For a time they stole softly, treading



<P>with their toes.&nbsp; It remained laughing there in



<P>the grass.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm commencin' t' feel pretty bad," said the



<P>tattered man, suddenly breaking one of his little



<P>silences.&nbsp; "I'm commencin' t' feel pretty damn'



<P>bad."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth groaned.&nbsp; "O Lord!"&nbsp; He won-



<P>dered if he was to be the tortured witness of



<P>another grim encounter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But his companion waved his hand reassur-



<P>ingly.&nbsp; "Oh, I'm not goin' t' die yit!&nbsp; There too



<P>much dependin' on me fer me t' die yit.&nbsp; No, sir!



<P>Nary die!&nbsp; I CAN'T!&nbsp; Ye'd oughta see th' swad



<P>a' chil'ren I've got, an' all like that."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth glancing at his companion could



<P>see by the shadow of a smile that he was making



<P>some kind of fun.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As they plodded on the tattered soldier con-



<P>tinued to talk.&nbsp; "Besides, if I died, I wouldn't



<P>die th' way that feller did.&nbsp; That was th' funniest



<P>thing.&nbsp; I'd jest flop down, I would.&nbsp; I never seen



<P>a feller die th' way that feller did.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yeh know Tom Jamison, he lives next door



<P>t' me up home.&nbsp; He's a nice feller, he is, an' we



<P>was allus good friends.&nbsp; Smart, too.&nbsp; Smart as a



<P>steel trap.&nbsp; Well, when we was a-fightin' this



<P>atternoon, all-of-a-sudden he begin t' rip up an'



<P>cuss an' beller at me.&nbsp; 'Yer shot, yeh blamed



<P>infernal!'--he swear horrible--he ses t' me.&nbsp; I



<P>put up m' hand t' m' head an' when I looked at



<P>m' fingers, I seen, sure 'nough, I was shot.&nbsp; I



<P>give a holler an' begin t' run, but b'fore I could



<P>git away another one hit me in th' arm an' whirl'



<P>me clean 'round.&nbsp; I got skeared when they was



<P>all a-shootin' b'hind me an' I run t' beat all,



<P>but I cotch it pretty bad.&nbsp; I've an idee I'd



<P>a' been fightin' yit, if t'was n't fer Tom Jami-



<P>son."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then he made a calm announcement: "There's



<P>two of 'em--little ones--but they 're beginnin' t'



<P>have fun with me now.&nbsp; I don't b'lieve I kin walk



<P>much furder."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>They went slowly on in silence.&nbsp; "Yeh look



<P>pretty peek-ed yerself," said the tattered man at



<P>last.&nbsp; "I bet yeh 've got a worser one than yeh



<P>think.&nbsp; Ye'd better take keer of yer hurt.&nbsp; It



<P>don't do t' let sech things go.&nbsp; It might be inside



<P>mostly, an' them plays thunder.&nbsp; Where is it



<P>located?"&nbsp; But he continued his harangue with-



<P>out waiting for a reply.&nbsp; "I see 'a feller git hit



<P>plum in th' head when my reg'ment was a-standin'



<P>at ease onct.&nbsp; An' everybody yelled out to 'im:



<P>Hurt, John?&nbsp; Are yeh hurt much?&nbsp; 'No," ses he.



<P>He looked kinder surprised, an' he went on tellin'



<P>'em how he felt.&nbsp; He sed he didn't feel nothin'.



<P>But, by dad, th' first thing that feller knowed he



<P>was dead.&nbsp; Yes, he was dead--stone dead.&nbsp; So,



<P>yeh wanta watch out.&nbsp; Yeh might have some



<P>queer kind 'a hurt yerself.&nbsp; Yeh can't never tell.



<P>Where is your'n located?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth had been wriggling since the intro-



<P>duction of this topic.&nbsp; He now gave a cry of ex-



<P>asperation and made a furious motion with his



<P>hand.&nbsp; "Oh, don't bother me!" he said.&nbsp; He was



<P>enraged against the tattered man, and could have



<P>strangled him.&nbsp; His companions seemed ever to



<P>play intolerable parts.&nbsp; They were ever uprais-



<P>ing the ghost of shame on the stick of their



<P>curiosity.&nbsp; He turned toward the tattered man as



<P>one at bay.&nbsp; "Now, don't bother me," he re-



<P>peated with desperate menace.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, Lord knows I don't wanta bother any-



<P>body," said the other.&nbsp; There was a little accent



<P>of despair in his voice as he replied, "Lord



<P>knows I 've gota 'nough m' own t' tend to."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth, who had been holding a bitter de-



<P>bate with himself and casting glances of hatred



<P>and contempt at the tattered man, here spoke in



<P>a hard voice.&nbsp; "Good-by," he said.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The tattered man looked at him in gaping



<P>amazement.&nbsp; "Why--why, pardner, where yeh



<P>goin'?" he asked unsteadily.&nbsp; The youth looking



<P>at him, could see that he, too, like that other one,



<P>was beginning to act dumb and animal-like.&nbsp; His



<P>thoughts seemed to be floundering about in his



<P>head.&nbsp; "Now--now--look--a--here, you Tom



<P>Jamison--now--I won't have this--this here



<P>won't do.&nbsp; Where--where yeh goin'?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth pointed vaguely.&nbsp; "Over there,"



<P>he replied.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, now look--a--here--now," said the



<P>tattered man, rambling on in idiot fashion.&nbsp; His



<P>head was hanging forward and his words were



<P>slurred.&nbsp; "This thing won't do, now, Tom Jami-



<P>son.&nbsp; It won't do.&nbsp; I know yeh, yeh pig-headed



<P>devil.&nbsp; Yeh wanta go trompin' off with a bad



<P>hurt.&nbsp; It ain't right--now--Tom Jamison--it ain't.



<P>Yeh wanta leave me take keer of yeh, Tom Jami-



<P>son.&nbsp; It ain't--right--it ain't--fer yeh t' go--



<P>trompin' off--with a bad hurt--it ain't--ain't--



<P>ain't right--it ain't."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In reply the youth climbed a fence and



<P>started away.&nbsp; He could hear the tattered man



<P>bleating plaintively.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Once he faced about angrily.&nbsp; "What?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Look--a--here, now, Tom Jamison--now--



<P>it ain't--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth went on.&nbsp; Turning at a distance he



<P>saw the tattered man wandering about helplessly



<P>in the field.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He now thought that he wished he was dead.



<P>He believed that he envied those men whose



<P>bodies lay strewn over the grass of the fields and



<P>on the fallen leaves of the forest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The simple questions of the tattered man had



<P>been knife thrusts to him.&nbsp; They asserted a



<P>society that probes pitilessly at secrets until all is



<P>apparent.&nbsp; His late companion's chance persist-



<P>ency made him feel that he could not keep his



<P>crime concealed in his bosom.&nbsp; It was sure to be



<P>brought plain by one of those arrows which



<P>cloud the air and are constantly pricking, dis-



<P>covering, proclaiming those things which are



<P>willed to be forever hidden.&nbsp; He admitted that



<P>he could not defend himself against this agency.



<P>It was not within the power of vigilance.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>HE became aware that the furnace roar of the



<P>battle was growing louder.&nbsp; Great brown clouds



<P>had floated to the still heights of air before him.



<P>The noise, too, was approaching.&nbsp; The woods



<P>filtered men and the fields became dotted.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As he rounded a hillock, he perceived that the



<P>roadway was now a crying mass of wagons,



<P>teams, and men.&nbsp; From the heaving tangle issued



<P>exhortations, commands, imprecations.&nbsp; Fear was



<P>sweeping it all along.&nbsp; The cracking whips bit



<P>and horses plunged and tugged.&nbsp; The white-



<P>topped wagons strained and stumbled in their



<P>exertions like fat sheep.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth felt comforted in a measure by this



<P>sight.&nbsp; They were all retreating.&nbsp; Perhaps, then,



<P>he was not so bad after all.&nbsp; He seated himself



<P>and watched the terror-stricken wagons.&nbsp; They



<P>fled like soft, ungainly animals.&nbsp; All the roarers



<P>and lashers served to help him to magnify the



<P>dangers and horrors of the engagement that he



<P>might try to prove to himself that the thing with



<P>which men could charge him was in truth a



<P>symmetrical act.&nbsp; There was an amount of pleas-



<P>ure to him in watching the wild march of this



<P>vindication.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Presently the calm head of a forward-going



<P>column of infantry appeared in the road.&nbsp; It



<P>came swiftly on.&nbsp; Avoiding the obstructions gave



<P>it the sinuous movement of a serpent.&nbsp; The men



<P>at the head butted mules with their musket



<P>stocks.&nbsp; They prodded teamsters indifferent to



<P>all howls.&nbsp; The men forced their way through



<P>parts of the dense mass by strength.&nbsp; The blunt



<P>head of the column pushed.&nbsp; The raving team-



<P>sters swore many strange oaths.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The commands to make way had the ring of a



<P>great importance in them.&nbsp; The men were going



<P>forward to the heart of the din.&nbsp; They were to



<P>confront the eager rush of the enemy.&nbsp; They felt



<P>the pride of their onward movement when the



<P>remainder of the army seemed trying to dribble



<P>down this road.&nbsp; They tumbled teams about



<P>with a fine feeling that it was no matter so long



<P>as their column got to the front in time.&nbsp; This



<P>importance made their faces grave and stern.



<P>And the backs of the officers were very rigid.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As the youth looked at them the black weight



<P>of his woe returned to him.&nbsp; He felt that he was



<P>regarding a procession of chosen beings.&nbsp; The



<P>separation was as great to him as if they had



<P>marched with weapons of flame and banners of



<P>sunlight.&nbsp; He could never be like them.&nbsp; He



<P>could have wept in his longings.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He searched about in his mind for an ade-



<P>quate malediction for the indefinite cause, the



<P>thing upon which men turn the words of final



<P>blame.&nbsp; It--whatever it was--was responsible for



<P>him, he said.&nbsp; There lay the fault.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The haste of the column to reach the battle



<P>seemed to the forlorn young man to be some-



<P>thing much finer than stout fighting.&nbsp; Heroes, he



<P>thought, could find excuses in that long seething



<P>lane.&nbsp; They could retire with perfect self-respect



<P>and make excuses to the stars.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He wondered what those men had eaten that



<P>they could be in such haste to force their way to



<P>grim chances of death.&nbsp; As he watched his envy



<P>grew until he thought that he wished to change



<P>lives with one of them.&nbsp; He would have liked to



<P>have used a tremendous force, he said, throw off



<P>himself and become a better.&nbsp; Swift pictures of



<P>himself, apart, yet in himself, came to him--a



<P>blue desperate figure leading lurid charges with



<P>one knee forward and a broken blade high--a



<P>blue, determined figure standing before a crimson



<P>and steel assault, getting calmly killed on a high



<P>place before the eyes of all.&nbsp; He thought of the



<P>magnificent pathos of his dead body.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These thoughts uplifted him.&nbsp; He felt the



<P>quiver of war desire.&nbsp; In his ears, he heard the



<P>ring of victory.&nbsp; He knew the frenzy of a rapid



<P>successful charge.&nbsp; The music of the trampling



<P>feet, the sharp voices, the clanking arms of the



<P>column near him made him soar on the red wings



<P>of war.&nbsp; For a few moments he was sublime.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He thought that he was about to start for the



<P>front.&nbsp; Indeed, he saw a picture of himself, dust-



<P>stained, haggard, panting, flying to the front at



<P>the proper moment to seize and throttle the dark,



<P>leering witch of calamity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then the difficulties of the thing began to



<P>drag at him.&nbsp; He hesitated, balancing awkwardly



<P>on one foot.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had no rifle; he could not fight with his



<P>hands, said he resentfully to his plan.&nbsp; Well,



<P>rifles could be had for the picking.&nbsp; They were



<P>extraordinarily profuse.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Also, he continued, it would be a miracle if he



<P>found his regiment.&nbsp; Well, he could fight with



<P>any regiment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He started forward slowly.&nbsp; He stepped as if



<P>he expected to tread upon some explosive thing.



<P>Doubts and he were struggling.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He would truly be a worm if any of his com-



<P>rades should see him returning thus, the marks of



<P>his flight upon him.&nbsp; There was a reply that the



<P>intent fighters did not care for what happened



<P>rearward saving that no hostile bayonets ap-



<P>peared there.&nbsp; In the battle-blur his face would,



<P>in a way be hidden, like the face of a cowled



<P>man.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But then he said that his tireless fate would



<P>bring forth, when the strife lulled for a moment,



<P>a man to ask of him an explanation.&nbsp; In imagina-



<P>tion he felt the scrutiny of his companions as he



<P>painfully labored through some lies.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Eventually, his courage expended itself upon



<P>these objections.&nbsp; The debates drained him of his



<P>fire.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was not cast down by this defeat of his



<P>plan, for, upon studying the affair carefully, he



<P>could not but admit that the objections were very



<P>formidable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Furthermore, various ailments had begun to



<P>cry out.&nbsp; In their presence he could not persist



<P>in flying high with the wings of war; they



<P>rendered it almost impossible for him to see him-



<P>self in a heroic light.&nbsp; He tumbled headlong.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He discovered that he had a scorching thirst.



<P>His face was so dry and grimy that he thought



<P>he could feel his skin crackle.&nbsp; Each bone of his



<P>body had an ache in it, and seemingly threatened



<P>to break with each movement.&nbsp; His feet were



<P>like two sores.&nbsp; Also, his body was calling for



<P>food.&nbsp; It was more powerful than a direct hunger.



<P>There was a dull, weight like feeling in his stom-



<P>ach, and, when he tried to walk, his head swayed



<P>and he tottered.&nbsp; He could not see with distinct-



<P>ness.&nbsp; Small patches of green mist floated before



<P>his vision.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>While he had been tossed by many emotions,



<P>he had not been aware of ailments.&nbsp; Now they



<P>beset him and made clamor.&nbsp; As he was at last



<P>compelled to pay attention to them, his capacity



<P>for self-hate was multiplied.&nbsp; In despair, he



<P>declared that he was not like those others.&nbsp; He



<P>now conceded it to be impossible that he should



<P>ever become a hero.&nbsp; He was a craven loon.



<P>Those pictures of glory were piteous things.&nbsp; He



<P>groaned from his heart and went staggering off.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A certain mothlike quality within him kept



<P>him in the vicinity of the battle.&nbsp; He had a great



<P>desire to see, and to get news.&nbsp; He wished to



<P>know who was winning.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He told himself that, despite his unprecedented



<P>suffering, he had never lost his greed for a victory,



<P>yet, he said, in a half-apologetic manner to his



<P>conscience, he could not but know that a defeat



<P>for the army this time might mean many favor-



<P>able things for him.&nbsp; The blows of the enemy



<P>would splinter regiments into fragments.&nbsp; Thus,



<P>many men of courage, he considered, would be



<P>obliged to desert the colors and scurry like



<P>chickens.&nbsp; He would appear as one of them.



<P>They would be sullen brothers in distress, and he



<P>could then easily believe he had not run any



<P>farther or faster than they.&nbsp; And if he himself



<P>could believe in his virtuous perfection, he con-



<P>ceived that there would be small trouble in con-



<P>vincing all others.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He said, as if in excuse for this hope, that



<P>previously the army had encountered great



<P>defeats and in a few months had shaken off all



<P>blood and tradition of them, emerging as bright



<P>and valiant as a new one; thrusting out of sight



<P>the memory of disaster, and appearing with the



<P>valor and confidence of unconquered legions.



<P>The shrilling voices of the people at home would



<P>pipe dismally for a time, but various generals



<P>were usually compelled to listen to these ditties.



<P>He of course felt no compunctions for proposing



<P>a general as a sacrifice.&nbsp; He could not tell who



<P>the chosen for the barbs might be, so he could



<P>center no direct sympathy upon him.&nbsp; The



<P>people were afar and he did not conceive public



<P>opinion to be accurate at long range.&nbsp; It was



<P>quite probable they would hit the wrong man



<P>who, after he had recovered from his amazement



<P>would perhaps spend the rest of his days in writ-



<P>ing replies to the songs of his alleged failure.&nbsp; It



<P>would be very unfortunate, no doubt, but in this



<P>case a general was of no consequence to the



<P>youth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In a defeat there would be a roundabout



<P>vindication of himself.&nbsp; He thought it would



<P>prove, in a manner, that he had fled early because



<P>of his superior powers of perception.&nbsp; A serious



<P>prophet upon predicting a flood should be the



<P>first man to climb a tree.&nbsp; This would demon-



<P>strate that he was indeed a seer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A moral vindication was regarded by the



<P>youth as a very important thing.&nbsp; Without salve,



<P>he could not, he thought, wear the sore badge of



<P>his dishonor through life.&nbsp; With his heart con-



<P>tinually assuring him that he was despicable, he



<P>could not exist without making it, through his



<P>actions, apparent to all men.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If the army had gone gloriously on he would



<P>be lost.&nbsp; If the din meant that now his army's



<P>flags were tilted forward he was a condemned



<P>wretch.&nbsp; He would be compelled to doom



<P>himself to isolation.&nbsp; If the men were advancing,



<P>their indifferent feet were trampling upon his



<P>chances for a successful life.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As these thoughts went rapidly through his



<P>mind, he turned upon them and tried to thrust



<P>them away.&nbsp; He denounced himself as a villain.



<P>He said that he was the most unutterably selfish



<P>man in existence.&nbsp; His mind pictured the soldiers



<P>who would place their defiant bodies before the



<P>spear of the yelling battle fiend, and as he saw



<P>their dripping corpses on an imagined field, he



<P>said that he was their murderer.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Again he thought that he wished he was dead.



<P>He believed that he envied a corpse.&nbsp; Thinking



<P>of the slain, he achieved a great contempt for



<P>some of them, as if they were guilty for thus



<P>becoming lifeless.&nbsp; They might have been killed



<P>by lucky chances, he said, before they had had



<P>opportunities to flee or before they had been



<P>really tested.&nbsp; Yet they would receive laurels



<P>from tradition.&nbsp; He cried out bitterly that their



<P>crowns were stolen and their robes of glori-



<P>ous memories were shams.&nbsp; However, he still



<P>said that it was a great pity he was not as



<P>they.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A defeat of the army had suggested itself to



<P>him as a means of escape from the consequences



<P>of his fall.&nbsp; He considered, now, however, that it



<P>was useless to think of such a possibility.&nbsp; His



<P>education had been that success for that mighty



<P>blue machine was certain; that it would make



<P>victories as a contrivance turns out buttons.&nbsp; He



<P>presently discarded all his speculations in the



<P>other direction.&nbsp; He returned to the creed of



<P>soldiers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When he perceived again that it was not



<P>possible for the army to be defeated, he tried



<P>to bethink him of a fine tale which he could take



<P>back to his regiment, and with it turn the expected



<P>shafts of derision.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But, as he mortally feared these shafts, it



<P>became impossible for him to invent a tale he felt



<P>he could trust.&nbsp; He experimented with many



<P>schemes, but threw them aside one by one as



<P>flimsy.&nbsp; He was quick to see vulnerable places in



<P>them all.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Furthermore, he was much afraid that some



<P>arrow of scorn might lay him mentally low before



<P>he could raise his protecting tale.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He imagined the whole regiment saying:



<P>"Where's Henry Fleming?&nbsp; He run, didn't 'e?



<P>Oh, my!"&nbsp; He recalled various persons who



<P>would be quite sure to leave him no peace



<P>about it.&nbsp; They would doubtless question him



<P>with sneers, and laugh at his stammering hesi-



<P>tation.&nbsp; In the next engagement they would



<P>try to keep watch of him to discover when he



<P>would run.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Wherever he went in camp, he would en-



<P>counter insolent and lingeringly cruel stares.&nbsp; As



<P>he imagined himself passing near a crowd of



<P>comrades, he could hear some one say, "There



<P>he goes!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Then, as if the heads were moved by one



<P>muscle, all the faces were turned toward him



<P>with wide, derisive grins.&nbsp; He seemed to hear



<P>some one make a humorous remark in a low tone.



<P>At it the others all crowed and cackled.&nbsp; He was



<P>a slang phrase.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>THERE were moments of waiting.&nbsp; The youth



<P>thought of the village street at home before the



<P>arrival of the circus parade on a day in the



<P>spring.&nbsp; He remembered how he had stood, a



<P>small, thrillful boy, prepared to follow the dingy



<P>lady upon the white horse, or the band in its



<P>faded chariot.&nbsp; He saw the yellow road, the



<P>lines of expectant people, and the sober houses.



<P>He particularly remembered an old fellow who



<P>used to sit upon a cracker box in front of the



<P>store and feign to despise such exhibitions.&nbsp; A



<P>thousand details of color and form surged in his



<P>mind.&nbsp; The old fellow upon the cracker box ap-



<P>peared in middle prominence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Some one cried, "Here they come!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was rustling and muttering among the



<P>men.&nbsp; They displayed a feverish desire to have



<P>every possible cartridge ready to their hands.



<P>The boxes were pulled around into various posi-



<P>tions, and adjusted with great care.&nbsp; It was as if



<P>seven hundred new bonnets were being tried on.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The tall soldier, having prepared his rifle, pro-



<P>duced a red handkerchief of some kind.&nbsp; He was



<P>engaged in knitting it about his throat with ex-



<P>quisite attention to its position, when the cry was



<P>repeated up and down the line in a muffled roar



<P>of sound.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Here they come!&nbsp; Here they come!"&nbsp; Gun



<P>locks clicked.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Across the smoke-infested fields came a brown



<P>swarm of running men who were giving shrill



<P>yells.&nbsp; They came on, stooping and swinging



<P>their rifles at all angles.&nbsp; A flag, tilted forward,



<P>sped near the front.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As he caught sight of them the youth was



<P>momentarily startled by a thought that perhaps



<P>his gun was not loaded.&nbsp; He stood trying to



<P>rally his faltering intellect so that he might rec-



<P>ollect the moment when he had loaded, but he



<P>could not.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A hatless general pulled his dripping horse to



<P>a stand near the colonel of the 304th.&nbsp; He shook



<P>his fist in the other's face.&nbsp; "You 've got to hold



<P>'em back!" he shouted, savagely; "you 've got



<P>to hold 'em back!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In his agitation the colonel began to stammer.



<P>"A-all r-right, General, all right, by Gawd!&nbsp; We-



<P>we'll do our--we-we'll d-d-do--do our best, Gen-



<P>eral."&nbsp; The general made a passionate gesture



<P>and galloped away.&nbsp; The colonel, perchance to



<P>relieve his feelings, began to scold like a wet



<P>parrot.&nbsp; The youth, turning swiftly to make



<P>sure that the rear was unmolested, saw the com-



<P>mander regarding his men in a highly regretful



<P>manner, as if he regretted above everything his



<P>association with them.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The man at the youth's elbow was mumbling,



<P>as if to himself: "Oh, we 're in for it now! oh,



<P>we 're in for it now!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The captain of the company had been pacing



<P>excitedly to and fro in the rear.&nbsp; He coaxed in



<P>schoolmistress fashion, as to a congregation of



<P>boys with primers.&nbsp; His talk was an endless



<P>repetition.&nbsp; "Reserve your fire, boys--don't



<P>shoot till I tell you--save your fire--wait till



<P>they get close up--don't be damned fools--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Perspiration streamed down the youth's face,



<P>which was soiled like that of a weeping urchin.



<P>He frequently, with a nervous movement, wiped



<P>his eyes with his coat sleeve.&nbsp; His mouth was



<P>still a little ways open.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He got the one glance at the foe-swarming



<P>field in front of him, and instantly ceased to de-



<P>bate the question of his piece being loaded.&nbsp; Be-



<P>fore he was ready to begin--before he had an-



<P>nounced to himself that he was about to fight--



<P>he threw the obedient, well-balanced rifle into



<P>position and fired a first wild shot.&nbsp; Directly he



<P>was working at his weapon like an automatic



<P>affair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He suddenly lost concern for himself, and for-



<P>got to look at a menacing fate.&nbsp; He became not a



<P>man but a member.&nbsp; He felt that something of



<P>which he was a part--a regiment, an army, a



<P>cause, or a country--was in a crisis.&nbsp; He was



<P>welded into a common personality which was



<P>dominated by a single desire.&nbsp; For some mo-



<P>ments he could not flee no more than a little



<P>finger can commit a revolution from a hand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>If he had thought the regiment was about to



<P>be annihilated perhaps he could have amputated



<P>himself from it.&nbsp; But its noise gave him assur-



<P>ance.&nbsp; The regiment was like a firework that,



<P>once ignited, proceeds superior to circumstances



<P>until its blazing vitality fades.&nbsp; It wheezed and



<P>banged with a mighty power.&nbsp; He pictured the



<P>ground before it as strewn with the discom-



<P>fited.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a consciousness always of the pres-



<P>ence of his comrades about him.&nbsp; He felt the



<P>subtle battle brotherhood more potent even than



<P>the cause for which they were fighting.&nbsp; It was a



<P>mysterious fraternity born of the smoke and dan-



<P>ger of death.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was at a task.&nbsp; He was like a carpenter



<P>who has made many boxes, making still another



<P>box, only there was furious haste in his move-



<P>ments.&nbsp; He, in his thought, was careering off in



<P>other places, even as the carpenter who as he



<P>works whistles and thinks of his friend or his



<P>enemy, his home or a saloon.&nbsp; And these jolted



<P>dreams were never perfect to him afterward, but



<P>remained a mass of blurred shapes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Presently he began to feel the effects of the



<P>war atmosphere--a blistering sweat, a sensation



<P>that his eyeballs were about to crack like hot



<P>stones.&nbsp; A burning roar filled his ears.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Following this came a red rage.&nbsp; He devel-



<P>oped the acute exasperation of a pestered animal,



<P>a well-meaning cow worried by dogs.&nbsp; He had a



<P>mad feeling against his rifle, which could only be



<P>used against one life at a time.&nbsp; He wished to



<P>rush forward and strangle with his fingers.&nbsp; He



<P>craved a power that would enable him to make a



<P>world-sweeping gesture and brush all back.&nbsp; His



<P>impotency appeared to him, and made his rage



<P>into that of a driven beast.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Buried in the smoke of many rifles his anger



<P>was directed not so much against the men whom



<P>he knew were rushing toward him as against the



<P>swirling battle phantoms which were choking



<P>him, stuffing their smoke robes down his parched



<P>throat.&nbsp; He fought frantically for respite for his



<P>senses, for air, as a babe being smothered attacks



<P>the deadly blankets.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a blare of heated rage mingled with



<P>a certain expression of intentness on all faces.



<P>Many of the men were making low-toned noises



<P>with their mouths, and these subdued cheers,



<P>snarls, imprecations, prayers, made a wild, bar-



<P>baric song that went as an undercurrent of sound,



<P>strange and chantlike with the resounding chords



<P>of the war march.&nbsp; The man at the youth's elbow



<P>was babbling.&nbsp; In it there was something soft and



<P>tender like the monologue of a babe.&nbsp; The tall



<P>soldier was swearing in a loud voice.&nbsp; From his



<P>lips came a black procession of curious oaths.&nbsp; Of



<P>a sudden another broke out in a querulous way



<P>like a man who has mislaid his hat.&nbsp; "Well, why



<P>don't they support us?&nbsp; Why don't they send



<P>supports?&nbsp; Do they think--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth in his battle sleep heard this as one



<P>who dozes hears.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a singular absence of heroic poses.



<P>The men bending and surging in their haste and



<P>rage were in every impossible attitude.&nbsp; The steel



<P>ramrods clanked and clanged with incessant din



<P>as the men pounded them furiously into the hot



<P>rifle barrels.&nbsp; The flaps of the cartridge boxes were



<P>all unfastened, and bobbed idiotically with each



<P>movement.&nbsp; The rifles, once loaded, were jerked



<P>to the shoulder and fired without apparent aim



<P>into the smoke or at one of the blurred and shift-



<P>ing forms which upon the field before the regi-



<P>ment had been growing larger and larger like



<P>puppets under a magician's hand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The officers, at their intervals, rearward, neg-



<P>lected to stand in picturesque attitudes.&nbsp; They



<P>were bobbing to and fro roaring directions and



<P>encouragements.&nbsp; The dimensions of their howls



<P>were extraordinary.&nbsp; They expended their lungs



<P>with prodigal wills.&nbsp; And often they nearly stood



<P>upon their heads in their anxiety to observe the



<P>enemy on the other side of the tumbling smoke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The lieutenant of the youth's company had en-



<P>countered a soldier who had fled screaming at



<P>the first volley of his comrades.&nbsp; Behind the lines



<P>these two were acting a little isolated scene.&nbsp; The



<P>man was blubbering and staring with sheeplike



<P>eyes at the lieutenant, who had seized him by the



<P>collar and was pommeling him.&nbsp; He drove him



<P>back into the ranks with many blows.&nbsp; The sol-



<P>dier went mechanically, dully, with his animal-



<P>like eyes upon the officer.&nbsp; Perhaps there was to



<P>him a divinity expressed in the voice of the other



<P>--stern, hard, with no reflection of fear in it.&nbsp; He



<P>tried to reload his gun, but his shaking hands pre-



<P>vented.&nbsp; The lieutenant was obliged to assist him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The men dropped here and there like bundles.



<P>The captain of the youth's company had been



<P>killed in an early part of the action.&nbsp; His body



<P>lay stretched out in the position of a tired man



<P>resting, but upon his face there was an astonished



<P>and sorrowful look, as if he thought some friend



<P>had done him an ill turn.&nbsp; The babbling man was



<P>grazed by a shot that made the blood stream



<P>widely down his face.&nbsp; He clapped both hands



<P>to his head.&nbsp; "Oh!" he said, and ran.&nbsp; Another



<P>grunted suddenly as if he had been struck by a



<P>club in the stomach.&nbsp; He sat down and gazed



<P>ruefully.&nbsp; In his eyes there was mute, indefinite



<P>reproach.&nbsp; Farther up the line a man, standing



<P>behind a tree, had had his knee joint splintered



<P>by a ball.&nbsp; Immediately he had dropped his rifle



<P>and gripped the tree with both arms.&nbsp; And there



<P>he remained, clinging desperately and crying for



<P>assistance that he might withdraw his hold upon



<P>the tree.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At last an exultant yell went along the quiver-



<P>ing line.&nbsp; The firing dwindled from an uproar to



<P>a last vindictive popping.&nbsp; As the smoke slowly



<P>eddied away, the youth saw that the charge had



<P>been repulsed.&nbsp; The enemy were scattered into



<P>reluctant groups.&nbsp; He saw a man climb to the



<P>top of the fence, straddle the rail, and fire a part-



<P>ing shot.&nbsp; The waves had receded, leaving bits of



<P>dark debris upon the ground.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Some in the regiment began to whoop fren-



<P>ziedly.&nbsp; Many were silent.&nbsp; Apparently they were



<P>trying to contemplate themselves.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After the fever had left his veins, the youth



<P>thought that at last he was going to suffocate.



<P>He became aware of the foul atmosphere in



<P>which he had been struggling.&nbsp; He was grimy



<P>and dripping like a laborer in a foundry.&nbsp; He



<P>grasped his canteen and took a long swallow of



<P>the warmed water.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A sentence with variations went up and down



<P>the line.&nbsp; "Well, we 've helt 'em back.&nbsp; We 've



<P>helt 'em back; derned if we haven't."&nbsp; The men



<P>said it blissfully, leering at each other with dirty



<P>smiles.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth turned to look behind him and off



<P>to the right and off to the left.&nbsp; He experienced



<P>the joy of a man who at last finds leisure in which



<P>to look about him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Under foot there were a few ghastly forms



<P>motionless.&nbsp; They lay twisted in fantastic contor-



<P>tions.&nbsp; Arms were bent and heads were turned



<P>in incredible ways.&nbsp; It seemed that the dead men



<P>must have fallen from some great height to get



<P>into such positions.&nbsp; They looked to be dumped



<P>out upon the ground from the sky.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>From a position in the rear of the grove a bat-



<P>tery was throwing shells over it.&nbsp; The flash of



<P>the guns startled the youth at first.&nbsp; He thought



<P>they were aimed directly at him.&nbsp; Through the



<P>trees he watched the black figures of the gunners



<P>as they worked swiftly and intently.&nbsp; Their labor



<P>seemed a complicated thing.&nbsp; He wondered how



<P>they could remember its formula in the midst of



<P>confusion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The guns squatted in a row like savage chiefs.



<P>They argued with abrupt violence.&nbsp; It was a



<P>grim pow-wow.&nbsp; Their busy servants ran hither



<P>and thither.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A small procession of wounded men were go-



<P>ing drearily toward the rear.&nbsp; It was a flow of



<P>blood from the torn body of the brigade.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To the right and to the left were the dark



<P>lines of other troops.&nbsp; Far in front he thought he



<P>could see lighter masses protruding in points



<P>from the forest.&nbsp; They were suggestive of un-



<P>numbered thousands.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Once he saw a tiny battery go dashing along



<P>the line of the horizon.&nbsp; The tiny riders were



<P>beating the tiny horses.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>From a sloping hill came the sound of cheer-



<P>ings and clashes.&nbsp; Smoke welled slowly through



<P>the leaves.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Batteries were speaking with thunderous ora-



<P>torical effort.&nbsp; Here and there were flags, the



<P>red in the stripes dominating.&nbsp; They splashed



<P>bits of warm color upon the dark lines of



<P>troops.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth felt the old thrill at the sight of



<P>the emblem.&nbsp; They were like beautiful birds



<P>strangely undaunted in a storm.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As he listened to the din from the hillside, to



<P>a deep pulsating thunder that came from afar to



<P>the left, and to the lesser clamors which came



<P>from many directions, it occurred to him that



<P>they were fighting, too, over there, and over



<P>there, and over there.&nbsp; Heretofore he had sup-



<P>posed that all the battle was directly under his



<P>nose.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As he gazed around him the youth felt a flash



<P>of astonishment at the blue, pure sky and the



<P>sun gleamings on the trees and fields.&nbsp; It was



<P>surprising that Nature had gone tranquilly on



<P>with her golden process in the midst of so much



<P>devilment.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>THE cold passed reluctantly from the earth,



<P>and the retiring fogs revealed an army stretched



<P>out on the hills, resting.&nbsp; As the landscape



<P>changed from brown to green, the army awak-



<P>ened, and began to tremble with eagerness at the



<P>noise of rumors.&nbsp; It cast its eyes upon the roads,



<P>which were growing from long troughs of liquid



<P>mud to proper thoroughfares.&nbsp; A river, amber-



<P>tinted in the shadow of its banks, purled at the



<P>army's feet; and at night, when the stream had



<P>become of a sorrowful blackness, one could see



<P>across it the red, eyelike gleam of hostile camp-



<P>fires set in the low brows of distant hills.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Once a certain tall soldier developed virtues



<P>and went resolutely to wash a shirt.&nbsp; He came



<P>flying back from a brook waving his garment



<P>bannerlike.&nbsp; He was swelled with a tale he had



<P>heard from a reliable friend, who had heard it



<P>from a truthful cavalryman, who had heard it



<P>from his trustworthy brother, one of the order-



<P>lies at division headquarters.&nbsp; He adopted the



<P>important air of a herald in red and gold.



<P>"We're goin' t' move t' morrah--sure," he



<P>said pompously to a group in the company



<P>street.&nbsp; "We're goin' 'way up the river, cut



<P>across, an' come around in behint 'em."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To his attentive audience he drew a loud



<P>and elaborate plan of a very brilliant campaign.



<P>When he had finished, the blue-clothed men



<P>scattered into small arguing groups between the



<P>rows of squat brown huts.&nbsp; A negro teamster who



<P>had been dancing upon a cracker box with the



<P>hilarious encouragement of twoscore soldiers



<P>was deserted.&nbsp; He sat mournfully down.&nbsp; Smoke



<P>drifted lazily from a multitude of quaint chim-



<P>neys.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's a lie! that's all it is--a thunderin' lie!"



<P>said another private loudly.&nbsp; His smooth face was



<P>flushed, and his hands were thrust sulkily into his



<P>trousers' pockets.&nbsp; He took the matter as an



<P>affront to him.&nbsp; "I don't believe the derned old



<P>army's ever going to move.&nbsp; We're set.&nbsp; I've



<P>got ready to move eight times in the last two



<P>weeks, and we ain't moved yet."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The tall soldier felt called upon to defend



<P>the truth of a rumor he himself had intro-



<P>duced.&nbsp; He and the loud one came near to fight-



<P>ing over it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A corporal began to swear before the assem-



<P>blage.&nbsp; He had just put a costly board floor in



<P>his house, he said.&nbsp; During the early spring he



<P>had refrained from adding extensively to the



<P>comfort of his environment because he had felt



<P>that the army might start on the march at any



<P>moment.&nbsp; Of late, however, he had been im-



<P>pressed that they were in a sort of eternal camp.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Many of the men engaged in a spirited debate.



<P>One outlined in a peculiarly lucid manner all the



<P>plans of the commanding general.&nbsp; He was op-



<P>posed by men who advocated that there were



<P>other plans of campaign.&nbsp; They clamored at each



<P>other, numbers making futile bids for the pop-



<P>ular attention.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the soldier who had



<P>fetched the rumor bustled about with much



<P>importance.&nbsp; He was continually assailed by



<P>questions.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What's up, Jim?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Th' army's goin' t' move."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Ah, what yeh talkin' about?&nbsp; How yeh know



<P>it is?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, yeh kin b'lieve me er not, jest as yeh



<P>like.&nbsp; I don't care a hang."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was much food for thought in the man-



<P>ner in which he replied.&nbsp; He came near to con-



<P>vincing them by disdaining to produce proofs.



<P>They grew excited over it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a youthful private who listened



<P>with eager ears to the words of the tall soldier



<P>and to the varied comments of his comrades.



<P>After receiving a fill of discussions concerning



<P>marches and attacks, he went to his hut and



<P>crawled through an intricate hole that served it



<P>as a door.&nbsp; He wished to be alone with some



<P>new thoughts that had lately come to him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He lay down on a wide bank that stretched



<P>across the end of the room.&nbsp; In the other end,



<P>cracker boxes were made to serve as furniture.



<P>They were grouped about the fireplace.&nbsp; A pic-



<P>ture from an illustrated weekly was upon the log



<P>walls, and three rifles were paralleled on pegs.



<P>Equipments hunt on handy projections, and some



<P>tin dishes lay upon a small pile of firewood.&nbsp; A



<P>folded tent was serving as a roof.&nbsp; The sunlight,



<P>without, beating upon it, made it glow a light



<P>yellow shade.&nbsp; A small window shot an oblique



<P>square of whiter light upon the cluttered floor.



<P>The smoke from the fire at times neglected the



<P>clay chimney and wreathed into the room, and



<P>this flimsy chimney of clay and sticks made end-



<P>less threats to set ablaze the whole establishment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth was in a little trance of astonish-



<P>ment.&nbsp; So they were at last going to fight.&nbsp; On



<P>the morrow, perhaps, there would be a battle, and



<P>he would be in it.&nbsp; For a time he was obliged



<P>to labor to make himself believe.&nbsp; He could not



<P>accept with assurance an omen that he was about



<P>to mingle in one of those great affairs of the earth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had, of course, dreamed of battles all



<P>his life--of vague and bloody conflicts that had



<P>thrilled him with their sweep and fire.&nbsp; In visions



<P>he had seen himself in many struggles.&nbsp; He had



<P>imagined peoples secure in the shadow of his



<P>eagle-eyed prowess.&nbsp; But awake he had regarded



<P>battles as crimson blotches on the pages of the



<P>past.&nbsp; He had put them as things of the bygone



<P>with his thought-images of heavy crowns and



<P>high castles.&nbsp; There was a portion of the world's



<P>history which he had regarded as the time of



<P>wars, but it, he thought, had been long gone over



<P>the horizon and had disappeared forever.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>From his home his youthful eyes had looked



<P>upon the war in his own country with distrust.



<P>It must be some sort of a play affair.&nbsp; He had



<P>long despaired of witnessing a Greeklike struggle.



<P>Such would be no more, he had said.&nbsp; Men were



<P>better, or more timid.&nbsp; Secular and religious



<P>education had effaced the throat-grappling in-



<P>stinct, or else firm finance held in check the pas-



<P>sions.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had burned several times to enlist.&nbsp; Tales



<P>of great movements shook the land.&nbsp; They might



<P>not be distinctly Homeric, but there seemed to



<P>be much glory in them.&nbsp; He had read of marches,



<P>sieges, conflicts, and he had longed to see it all.



<P>His busy mind had drawn for him large pictures



<P>extravagant in color, lurid with breathless deeds.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But his mother had discouraged him.&nbsp; She



<P>had affected to look with some contempt upon



<P>the quality of his war ardor and patriotism.&nbsp; She



<P>could calmly seat herself and with no apparent



<P>difficulty give him many hundreds of reasons



<P>why he was of vastly more importance on the



<P>farm than on the field of battle.&nbsp; She had had



<P>certain ways of expression that told him that her



<P>statements on the subject came from a deep con-



<P>viction.&nbsp; Moreover, on her side, was his belief



<P>that her ethical motive in the argument was



<P>impregnable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At last, however, he had made firm rebellion



<P>against this yellow light thrown upon the color of



<P>his ambitions.&nbsp; The newspapers, the gossip of the



<P>village, his own picturings had aroused him to



<P>an uncheckable degree.&nbsp; They were in truth



<P>fighting finely down there.&nbsp; Almost every day



<P>the newspapers printed accounts of a decisive



<P>victory.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One night, as he lay in bed, the winds had



<P>carried to him the clangoring of the church bell



<P>as some enthusiast jerked the rope frantically to



<P>tell the twisted news of a great battle.&nbsp; This



<P>voice of the people rejoicing in the night had



<P>made him shiver in a prolonged ecstasy of ex-



<P>citement.&nbsp; Later, he had gone down to his



<P>mother's room and had spoken thus: "Ma, I'm



<P>going to enlist."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Henry, don't you be a fool," his mother had



<P>replied.&nbsp; She had then covered her face with the



<P>quilt.&nbsp; There was an end to the matter for that



<P>night.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Nevertheless, the next morning he had gone



<P>to a town that was near his mother's farm and



<P>had enlisted in a company that was forming there.



<P>When he had returned home his mother was



<P>milking the brindle cow.&nbsp; Four others stood



<P>waiting.&nbsp; "Ma, I've enlisted," he had said to her



<P>diffidently.&nbsp; There was a short silence.&nbsp; "The



<P>Lord's will be done, Henry," she had finally



<P>replied, and had then continued to milk the



<P>brindle cow.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When he had stood in the doorway with his



<P>soldier's clothes on his back, and with the light of



<P>excitement and expectancy in his eyes almost



<P>defeating the glow of regret for the home bonds,



<P>he had seen two tears leaving their trails on his



<P>mother's scarred cheeks.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Still, she had disappointed him by saying



<P>nothing whatever about returning with his shield



<P>or on it.&nbsp; He had privately primed himself for a



<P>beautiful scene.&nbsp; He had prepared certain sen-



<P>tences which he thought could be used with



<P>touching effect.&nbsp; But her words destroyed his



<P>plans.&nbsp; She had doggedly peeled potatoes and



<P>addressed him as follows: "You watch out,



<P>Henry, an' take good care of yerself in this here



<P>fighting business--you watch out, an' take good



<P>care of yerself.&nbsp; Don't go a-thinkin' you can



<P>lick the hull rebel army at the start, because yeh



<P>can't.&nbsp; Yer jest one little feller amongst a hull lot



<P>of others, and yeh've got to keep quiet an' do what



<P>they tell yeh.&nbsp; I know how you are, Henry.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I've knet yeh eight pair of socks, Henry, and



<P>I've put in all yer best shirts, because I want my



<P>boy to be jest as warm and comf'able as anybody



<P>in the army.&nbsp; Whenever they get holes in 'em, I



<P>want yeh to send 'em right-away back to me, so's



<P>I kin dern 'em.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"An' allus be careful an' choose yer comp'ny.



<P>There's lots of bad men in the army, Henry.



<P>The army makes 'em wild, and they like nothing



<P>better than the job of leading off a young feller



<P>like you, as ain't never been away from home



<P>much and has allus had a mother, an' a-learning



<P>'em to drink and swear.&nbsp; Keep clear of them



<P>folks, Henry.&nbsp; I don't want yeh to ever do any-



<P>thing, Henry, that yeh would be 'shamed to let



<P>me know about.&nbsp; Jest think as if I was a-watchin'



<P>yeh.&nbsp; If yeh keep that in yer mind allus, I guess



<P>yeh'll come out about right.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yeh must allus remember yer father, too,



<P>child, an' remember he never drunk a drop of



<P>licker in his life, and seldom swore a cross oath.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't know what else to tell yeh, Henry,



<P>excepting that yeh must never do no shirking,



<P>child, on my account.&nbsp; If so be a time comes when



<P>yeh have to be kilt or do a mean thing, why,



<P>Henry, don't think of anything 'cept what's right,



<P>because there's many a woman has to bear up



<P>'ginst sech things these times, and the Lord 'll



<P>take keer of us all.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Don't forgit about the socks and the shirts,



<P>child; and I've put a cup of blackberry jam with



<P>yer bundle, because I know yeh like it above all



<P>things.&nbsp; Good-by, Henry.&nbsp; Watch out, and be a



<P>good boy."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had, of course, been impatient under the



<P>ordeal of this speech.&nbsp; It had not been quite what



<P>he expected, and he had borne it with an air of



<P>irritation.&nbsp; He departed feeling vague relief.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Still, when he had looked back from the gate,



<P>he had seen his mother kneeling among the po-



<P>tato parings.&nbsp; Her brown face, upraised, was



<P>stained with tears, and her spare form was quiver-

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>10 RED BADGE OF COURAGE.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>ing.&nbsp; He bowed his head and went on, feeling



<P>suddenly ashamed of his purposes.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>From his home he had gone to the seminary



<P>to bid adieu to many schoolmates.&nbsp; They had



<P>thronged about him with wonder and admiration.



<P>He had felt the gulf now between them and had



<P>swelled with calm pride.&nbsp; He and some of his



<P>fellows who had donned blue were quite over-



<P>whelmed with privileges for all of one afternoon,



<P>and it had been a very delicious thing.&nbsp; They had



<P>strutted.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A certain light-haired girl had made vivacious



<P>fun at his martial spirit, but there was another and



<P>darker girl whom he had gazed at steadfastly, and



<P>he thought she grew demure and sad at sight of



<P>his blue and brass.&nbsp; As he had walked down the



<P>path between the rows of oaks, he had turned his



<P>head and detected her at a window watching his



<P>departure.&nbsp; As he perceived her, she had im-



<P>mediately begun to stare up through the high



<P>tree branches at the sky.&nbsp; He had seen a good



<P>deal of flurry and haste in her movement as she



<P>changed her attitude.&nbsp; He often thought of it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>On the way to Washington his spirit had



<P>soared.&nbsp; The regiment was fed and caressed at



<P>station after station until the youth had believed



<P>that he must be a hero.&nbsp; There was a lavish ex-



<P>penditure of bread and cold meats, coffee, and



<P>pickles and cheese.&nbsp; As he basked in the smiles



<P>of the girls and was patted and complimented by



<P>the old men, he had felt growing within him the



<P>strength to do mighty deeds of arms.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After complicated journeyings with many



<P>pauses, there had come months of monotonous



<P>life in a camp.&nbsp; He had had the belief that real



<P>war was a series of death struggles with small



<P>time in between for sleep and meals; but since his



<P>regiment had come to the field the army had done



<P>little but sit still and try to keep warm.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was brought then gradually back to his old



<P>ideas.&nbsp; Greeklike struggles would be no more.



<P>Men were better, or more timid.&nbsp; Secular and



<P>religious education had effaced the throat-grap-



<P>pling instinct, or else firm finance held in check



<P>the passions.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had grown to regard himself merely as a



<P>part of a vast blue demonstration.&nbsp; His province



<P>was to look out, as far as he could, for his per-



<P>sonal comfort.&nbsp; For recreation he could twiddle



<P>his thumbs and speculate on the thoughts which



<P>must agitate the minds of the generals.&nbsp; Also, he



<P>was drilled and drilled and reviewed, and drilled



<P>and drilled and reviewed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The only foes he had seen were some pickets



<P>along the river bank.&nbsp; They were a sun-tanned,



<P>philosophical lot, who sometimes shot reflectively



<P>at the blue pickets.&nbsp; When reproached for this



<P>afterward, they usually expressed sorrow, and



<P>swore by their gods that the guns had exploded



<P>without their permission.&nbsp; The youth, on guard



<P>duty one night, conversed across the stream with



<P>one of them.&nbsp; He was a slightly ragged man, who



<P>spat skillfully between his shoes and possessed a



<P>great fund of bland and infantile assurance.&nbsp; The



<P>youth liked him personally.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yank," the other had informed him, "yer a



<P>right dum good feller."&nbsp; This sentiment, floating



<P>to him upon the still air, had made him tempo-



<P>rarily regret war.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Various veterans had told him tales.&nbsp; Some



<P>talked of gray, bewhiskered hordes who were



<P>advancing with relentless curses and chewing



<P>tobacco with unspeakable valor; tremendous



<P>bodies of fierce soldiery who were sweeping



<P>along like the Huns.&nbsp; Others spoke of tattered



<P>and eternally hungry men who fired despondent



<P>powders.&nbsp; "They'll charge through hell's fire an'



<P>brimstone t' git a holt on a haversack, an' sech



<P>stomachs ain't a-lastin' long," he was told.&nbsp; From



<P>the stories, the youth imagined the red, live bones



<P>sticking out through slits in the faded uniforms.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Still, he could not put a whole faith in veter-



<P>ans' tales, for recruits were their prey.&nbsp; They



<P>talked much of smoke, fire, and blood, but he



<P>could not tell how much might be lies.&nbsp; They



<P>persistently yelled "Fresh fish!" at him, and were



<P>in no wise to be trusted.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>However, he perceived now that it did not



<P>greatly matter what kind of soldiers he was going



<P>to fight, so long as they fought, which fact no one



<P>disputed.&nbsp; There was a more serious problem.&nbsp; He



<P>lay in his bunk pondering upon it.&nbsp; He tried to



<P>mathematically prove to himself that he would



<P>not run from a battle.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Previously he had never felt obliged to wrestle



<P>too seriously with this question.&nbsp; In his life he had



<P>taken certain things for granted, never challeng-



<P>ing his belief in ultimate success, and bothering



<P>little about means and roads.&nbsp; But here he was



<P>confronted with a thing of moment.&nbsp; It had sud-



<P>denly appeared to him that perhaps in a battle he



<P>might run.&nbsp; He was forced to admit that as far as



<P>war was concerned he knew nothing of himself.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A sufficient time before he would have allowed



<P>the problem to kick its heels at the outer portals



<P>of his mind, but now he felt compelled to give



<P>serious attention to it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A little panic-fear grew in his mind.&nbsp; As his



<P>imagination went forward to a fight, he saw hide-



<P>ous possibilities.&nbsp; He contemplated the lurking



<P>menaces of the future, and failed in an effort to



<P>see himself standing stoutly in the midst of them.



<P>He recalled his visions of broken-bladed glory,



<P>but in the shadow of the impending tumult he



<P>suspected them to be impossible pictures.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He sprang from the bunk and began to pace



<P>nervously to and fro.&nbsp; "Good Lord, what's th'



<P>matter with me?" he said aloud.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He felt that in this crisis his laws of life were



<P>useless.&nbsp; Whatever he had learned of himself was



<P>here of no avail.&nbsp; He was an unknown quantity.



<P>He saw that he would again be obliged to experi-



<P>ment as he had in early youth.&nbsp; He must accumu-



<P>late information of himself, and meanwhile he re-



<P>solved to remain close upon his guard lest those



<P>qualities of which he knew nothing should ever-



<P>lastingly disgrace him.&nbsp; "Good Lord!" he re-



<P>peated in dismay.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a time the tall soldier slid dexterously



<P>through the hole.&nbsp; The loud private followed.



<P>They were wrangling.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"That's all right," said the tall soldier as he



<P>entered.&nbsp; He waved his hand expressively.&nbsp; "You



<P>can believe me or not, jest as you like.&nbsp; All you



<P>got to do is to sit down and wait as quiet as you



<P>can.&nbsp; Then pretty soon you'll find out I was right."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His comrade grunted stubbornly.&nbsp; For a mo-



<P>ment he seemed to be searching for a formidable



<P>reply.&nbsp; Finally he said: "Well, you don't know



<P>everything in the world, do you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Didn't say I knew everything in the world,"



<P>retorted the other sharply.&nbsp; He began to stow



<P>various articles snugly into his knapsack.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth, pausing in his nervous walk, looked



<P>down at the busy figure.&nbsp; "Going to be a battle,



<P>sure, is there, Jim?" he asked.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Of course there is," replied the tall soldier.



<P>"Of course there is.&nbsp; You jest wait 'til to-morrow,



<P>and you'll see one of the biggest battles ever was.



<P>You jest wait."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thunder!der!" said the youth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, you'll see fighting this time, my boy,



<P>what'll be regular out-and-out fighting," added



<P>the tall soldier, with the air of a man who is



<P>about to exhibit a battle for the benefit of his



<P>friends.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Huh!" said the loud one from a corner.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well," remarked the youth, "like as not this



<P>story'll turn out jest like them others did."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not much it won't," replied the tall soldier,



<P>exasperated.&nbsp; "Not much it won't.&nbsp; Didn't the



<P>cavalry all start this morning?"&nbsp; He glared about



<P>him.&nbsp; No one denied his statement.&nbsp; "The cav-



<P>alry started this morning," he continued.&nbsp; "They



<P>say there ain't hardly any cavalry left in camp.



<P>They're going to Richmond, or some place, while



<P>we fight all the Johnnies.&nbsp; It's some dodge like



<P>that.&nbsp; The regiment's got orders, too.&nbsp; A feller



<P>what seen 'em go to headquarters told me a little



<P>while ago.&nbsp; And they're raising blazes all over



<P>camp--anybody can see that."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Shucks!" said the loud one.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth remained silent for a time.&nbsp; At last



<P>he spoke to the tall soldier.&nbsp; "Jim!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How do you think the reg'ment 'll do?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, they'll fight all right, I guess, after they



<P>once get into it," said the other with cold judg-



<P>ment.&nbsp; He made a fine use of the third person.



<P>"There's been heaps of fun poked at 'em because



<P>they're new, of course, and all that; but they'll



<P>fight all right, I guess."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Think any of the boys 'll run?" persisted the



<P>youth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, there may be a few of 'em run, but



<P>there's them kind in every regiment, 'specially



<P>when they first goes under fire," said the other



<P>in a tolerant way.&nbsp; "Of course it might happen



<P>that the hull kit-and-boodle might start and run,



<P>if some big fighting came first-off, and then again



<P>they might stay and fight like fun.&nbsp; But you can't



<P>bet on nothing.&nbsp; Of course they ain't never been



<P>under fire yet, and it ain't likely they'll lick the



<P>hull rebel army all-to-oncet the first time; but I



<P>think they'll fight better than some, if worse than



<P>others.&nbsp; That's the way I figger.&nbsp; They call the



<P>reg'ment 'Fresh fish' and everything; but the



<P>boys come of good stock, and most of 'em 'll fight



<P>like sin after they oncet git shootin'," he added,



<P>with a mighty emphasis on the last four words.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, you think you know--" began the loud



<P>soldier with scorn.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The other turned savagely upon him.&nbsp; They



<P>had a rapid altercation, in which they fastened



<P>upon each other various strange epithets.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth at last interrupted them.&nbsp; "Did



<P>you ever think you might run yourself, Jim?" he



<P>asked.&nbsp; On concluding the sentence he laughed



<P>as if he had meant to aim a joke.&nbsp; The loud sol-



<P>dier also giggled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The tall private waved his hand.&nbsp; "Well," said



<P>he profoundly, "I've thought it might get too hot



<P>for Jim Conklin in some of them scrimmages, and



<P>if a whole lot of boys started and run, why, I



<P>s'pose I'd start and run.&nbsp; And if I once started to



<P>run, I'd run like the devil, and no mistake.&nbsp; But



<P>if everybody was a-standing and a-fighting, why,



<P>I'd stand and fight.&nbsp; Be jiminey, I would.&nbsp; I'll



<P>bet on it."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Huh!" said the loud one.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth of this tale felt gratitude for these



<P>words of his comrade.&nbsp; He had feared that all of



<P>the untried men possessed a great and correct



<P>confidence.&nbsp; He now was in a measure reassured.

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>THE regiment was standing at order arms at



<P>the side of a lane, waiting for the command to



<P>march, when suddenly the youth remembered



<P>the little packet enwrapped in a faded yellow



<P>envelope which the loud young soldier with lugu-



<P>brious words had intrusted to him.&nbsp; It made him



<P>start.&nbsp; He uttered an exclamation and turned



<P>toward his comrade.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Wilson!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His friend, at his side in the ranks, was thought-



<P>fully staring down the road.&nbsp; From some cause



<P>his expression was at that moment very meek.



<P>The youth, regarding him with sidelong glances,



<P>felt impelled to change his purpose.&nbsp; "Oh, noth-



<P>ing," he said.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His friend turned his head in some surprise,



<P>"Why, what was yeh goin' t' say?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, nothing," repeated the youth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He resolved not to deal the little blow.&nbsp; It

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>148



<P>was sufficient that the fact made him glad.&nbsp; It



<P>was not necessary to knock his friend on the head



<P>with the misguided packet.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had been possessed of much fear of his



<P>friend, for he saw how easily questionings could



<P>make holes in his feelings.&nbsp; Lately, he had as-



<P>sured himself that the altered comrade would not



<P>tantalize him with a persistent curiosity, but he



<P>felt certain that during the first period of leisure



<P>his friend would ask him to relate his adventures



<P>of the previous day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He now rejoiced in the possession of a small



<P>weapon with which he could prostrate his com-



<P>rade at the first signs of a cross-examination.&nbsp; He



<P>was master.&nbsp; It would now be he who could



<P>laugh and shoot the shafts of derision.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The friend had, in a weak hour, spoken with



<P>sobs of his own death.&nbsp; He had delivered a mel-



<P>ancholy oration previous to his funeral, and had



<P>doubtless in the packet of letters, presented vari-



<P>ous keepsakes to relatives.&nbsp; But he had not died,



<P>and thus he had delivered himself into the hands



<P>of the youth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The latter felt immensely superior to his



<P>friend, but he inclined to condescension.&nbsp; He



<P>adopted toward him an air of patronizing good



<P>humor.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His self-pride was now entirely restored.&nbsp; In



<P>the shade of its flourishing growth he stood with



<P>braced and self-confident legs, and since nothing



<P>could now be discovered he did not shrink from



<P>an encounter with the eyes of judges, and allowed



<P>no thoughts of his own to keep him from an



<P>attitude of manfulness.&nbsp; He had performed his



<P>mistakes in the dark, so he was still a man.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Indeed, when he remembered his fortunes of



<P>yesterday, and looked at them from a distance he



<P>began to see something fine there.&nbsp; He had



<P>license to be pompous and veteranlike.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His panting agonies of the past he put out of



<P>his sight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the present, he declared to himself that it



<P>was only the doomed and the damned who roared



<P>with sincerity at circumstance.&nbsp; Few but they



<P>ever did it.&nbsp; A man with a full stomach and the



<P>respect of his fellows had no business to scold



<P>about anything that he might think to be wrong



<P>in the ways of the universe, or even with the



<P>ways of society.&nbsp; Let the unfortunates rail; the



<P>others may play marbles.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He did not give a great deal of thought to



<P>these battles that lay directly before him.&nbsp; It was



<P>not essential that he should plan his ways in



<P>regard to them.&nbsp; He had been taught that many



<P>obligations of a life were easily avoided.&nbsp; The



<P>lessons of yesterday had been that retribution



<P>was a laggard and blind.&nbsp; With these facts before



<P>him he did not deem it necessary that he should



<P>become feverish over the possibilities of the



<P>ensuing twenty-four hours.&nbsp; He could leave



<P>much to chance.&nbsp; Besides, a faith in himself had



<P>secretly blossomed.&nbsp; There was a little flower of



<P>confidence growing within him.&nbsp; He was now a



<P>man of experience.&nbsp; He had been out among the



<P>dragons, he said, and he assured himself that they



<P>were not so hideous as he had imagined them.



<P>Also, they were inaccurate; they did not sting



<P>with precision.&nbsp; A stout heart often defied, and



<P>defying, escaped.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And, furthermore, how could they kill him



<P>who was the chosen of gods and doomed to



<P>greatness?

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He remembered how some of the men had



<P>run from the battle.&nbsp; As he recalled their terror-



<P>struck faces he felt a scorn for them.&nbsp; They had



<P>surely been more fleet and more wild than was



<P>absolutely necessary.&nbsp; They were weak mortals.



<P>As for himself, he had fled with discretion and



<P>dignity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was aroused from this reverie by his



<P>friend, who, having hitched about nervously and



<P>blinked at the trees for a time, suddenly coughed



<P>in an introductory way, and spoke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Fleming!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The friend put his hand up to his mouth and



<P>coughed again.&nbsp; He fidgeted in his jacket.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well," he gulped, at last, "I guess yeh might



<P>as well give me back them letters."&nbsp; Dark, prick-



<P>ling blood had flushed into his cheeks and brow.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"All right, Wilson," said the youth.&nbsp; He



<P>loosened two buttons of his coat, thrust in his



<P>hand, and brought forth the packet.&nbsp; As he ex-



<P>tended it to his friend the latter's face was turned



<P>from him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had been slow in the act of producing the



<P>packet because during it he had been trying to



<P>invent a remarkable comment upon the affair.



<P>He could conjure nothing of sufficient point.&nbsp; He



<P>was compelled to allow his friend to escape



<P>unmolested with his packet.&nbsp; And for this he



<P>took unto himself considerable credit.&nbsp; It was a



<P>generous thing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His friend at his side seemed suffering great



<P>shame.&nbsp; As he contemplated him, the youth felt



<P>his heart grow more strong and stout.&nbsp; He had



<P>never been compelled to blush in such manner



<P>for his acts; he was an individual of extraordi-



<P>nary virtues.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He reflected, with condescending pity: "Too



<P>bad!&nbsp; Too bad!&nbsp; The poor devil, it makes him



<P>feel tough!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After this incident, and as he reviewed the



<P>battle pictures he had seen, he felt quite com-



<P>petent to return home and make the hearts of



<P>the people glow with stories of war.&nbsp; He could



<P>see himself in a room of warm tints telling tales



<P>to listeners.&nbsp; He could exhibit laurels.&nbsp; They



<P>were insignificant; still, in a district where



<P>laurels were infrequent, they might shine.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He saw his gaping audience picturing him as



<P>the central figure in blazing scenes.&nbsp; And he



<P>imagined the consternation and the ejaculations



<P>of his mother and the young lady at the seminary



<P>as they drank his recitals.&nbsp; Their vague feminine



<P>formula for beloved ones doing brave deeds on



<P>the field of battle without risk of life would be



<P>destroyed.

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>WHEN the youth awoke it seemed to him that



<P>he had been asleep for a thousand years, and he



<P>felt sure that he opened his eyes upon an unex-



<P>pected world.&nbsp; Gray mists were slowly shifting



<P>before the first efforts of the sun rays.&nbsp; An im-



<P>pending splendor could be seen in the eastern



<P>sky.&nbsp; An icy dew had chilled his face, and im-



<P>mediately upon arousing he curled farther down



<P>into his blanket.&nbsp; He stared for a while at the



<P>leaves overhead, moving in a heraldic wind of



<P>the day.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The distance was splintering and blaring with



<P>the noise of fighting.&nbsp; There was in the sound



<P>an expression of a deadly persistency, as if it had



<P>not begun and was not to cease.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>About him were the rows and groups of men



<P>that he had dimly seen the previous night.&nbsp; They



<P>were getting a last draught of sleep before the



<P>awakening.&nbsp; The gaunt, careworn features and



<P>dusty figures were made plain by this quaint

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>139



<P>light at the dawning, but it dressed the skin of



<P>the men in corpselike hues and made the tangled



<P>limbs appear pulseless and dead.&nbsp; The youth



<P>started up with a little cry when his eyes first



<P>swept over this motionless mass of men, thick-



<P>spread upon the ground, pallid, and in strange



<P>postures.&nbsp; His disordered mind interpreted the



<P>hall of the forest as a charnel place.&nbsp; He believed



<P>for an instant that he was in the house of the



<P>dead, and he did not dare to move lest these



<P>corpses start up, squalling and squawking.&nbsp; In a



<P>second, however, he achieved his proper mind.



<P>He swore a complicated oath at himself.&nbsp; He



<P>saw that this somber picture was not a fact of



<P>the present, but a mere prophecy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He heard then the noise of a fire crackling



<P>briskly in the cold air, and, turning his head, he



<P>saw his friend pottering busily about a small



<P>blaze.&nbsp; A few other figures moved in the fog, and



<P>he heard the hard cracking of axe blows.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Suddenly there was a hollow rumble of



<P>drums.&nbsp; A distant bugle sang faintly.&nbsp; Similar



<P>sounds, varying in strength, came from near and



<P>far over the forest.&nbsp; The bugles called to each



<P>other like brazen gamecocks.&nbsp; The near thunder



<P>of the regimental drums rolled.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The body of men in the woods rustled.&nbsp; There



<P>was a general uplifting of heads.&nbsp; A murmuring



<P>of voices broke upon the air.&nbsp; In it there was



<P>much bass of grumbling oaths.&nbsp; Strange gods



<P>were addressed in condemnation of the early



<P>hours necessary to correct war.&nbsp; An officer's



<P>peremptory tenor rang out and quickened the



<P>stiffened movement of the men.&nbsp; The tangled



<P>limbs unraveled.&nbsp; The corpse-hued faces were



<P>hidden behind fists that twisted slowly in the eye



<P>sockets.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth sat up and gave vent to an enormous



<P>yawn.&nbsp; "Thunder!" he remarked petulantly.



<P>He rubbed his eyes, and then putting up his hand



<P>felt carefully of the bandage over his wound.



<P>His friend, perceiving him to be awake, came



<P>from the fire.&nbsp; "Well, Henry, ol' man, how do



<P>yeh feel this mornin'?" he demanded.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth yawned again.&nbsp; Then he puckered



<P>his mouth to a little pucker.&nbsp; His head, in truth,



<P>felt precisely like a melon, and there was an un-



<P>pleasant sensation at his stomach.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, Lord, I feel pretty bad," he said.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Thunder!" exclaimed the other.&nbsp; "I hoped



<P>ye'd feel all right this mornin'.&nbsp; Let's see th'



<P>bandage--I guess it's slipped."&nbsp; He began to



<P>tinker at the wound in rather a clumsy way until



<P>the youth exploded.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Gosh-dern it!" he said in sharp irritation;



<P>"you're the hangdest man I ever saw!&nbsp; You



<P>wear muffs on your hands.&nbsp; Why in good



<P>thunderation can't you be more easy?&nbsp; I'd rather



<P>you'd stand off an' throw guns at it.&nbsp; Now, go



<P>slow, an' don't act as if you was nailing down



<P>carpet."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He glared with insolent command at his



<P>friend, but the latter answered soothingly.



<P>"Well, well, come now, an' git some grub," he



<P>said.&nbsp; "Then, maybe, yeh'll feel better."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At the fireside the loud young soldier



<P>watched over his comrade's wants with tender-



<P>ness and care.&nbsp; He was very busy marshaling



<P>the little black vagabonds of tin cups and pour-



<P>ing into them the streaming, iron colored mixture



<P>from a small and sooty tin pail.&nbsp; He had some



<P>fresh meat, which he roasted hurriedly upon a



<P>stick.&nbsp; He sat down then and contemplated the



<P>youth's appetite with glee.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth took note of a remarkable change



<P>in his comrade since those days of camp life upon



<P>the river bank.&nbsp; He seemed no more to be con-



<P>tinually regarding the proportions of his personal



<P>prowess.&nbsp; He was not furious at small words that



<P>pricked his conceits.&nbsp; He was no more a loud



<P>young soldier.&nbsp; There was about him now a



<P>fine reliance.&nbsp; He showed a quiet belief in



<P>his purposes and his abilities.&nbsp; And this in-



<P>ward confidence evidently enabled him to be



<P>indifferent to little words of other men aimed



<P>at him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth reflected.&nbsp; He had been used to



<P>regarding his comrade as a blatant child with an



<P>audacity grown from his inexperience, thought-



<P>less, headstrong, jealous, and filled with a tinsel



<P>courage.&nbsp; A swaggering babe accustomed to strut



<P>in his own dooryard.&nbsp; The youth wondered



<P>where had been born these new eyes; when his



<P>comrade had made the great discovery that



<P>there were many men who would refuse to be



<P>subjected by him.&nbsp; Apparently, the other had



<P>now climbed a peak of wisdom from which he



<P>could perceive himself as a very wee thing.&nbsp; And



<P>the youth saw that ever after it would be easier



<P>to live in his friend's neighborhood.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His comrade balanced his ebony coffee-cup on



<P>his knee.&nbsp; "Well, Henry," he said, "what d'yeh



<P>think th' chances are?&nbsp; D'yeh think we'll wal-



<P>lop 'em?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth considered for a moment.&nbsp; "Day-



<P>b'fore-yesterday," he finally replied, with boldness,



<P>"you would 'a' bet you'd lick the hull kit-an'-



<P>boodle all by yourself."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His friend looked a trifle amazed.&nbsp; "Would



<P>I?" he asked.&nbsp; He pondered.&nbsp; "Well, perhaps I



<P>would," he decided at last.&nbsp; He stared humbly at



<P>the fire.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth was quite disconcerted at this sur-



<P>prising reception of his remarks.&nbsp; "Oh, no, you



<P>wouldn't either," he said, hastily trying to re-



<P>trace.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But the other made a deprecating gesture.



<P>"Oh, yeh needn't mind, Henry," he said.&nbsp; "I be-



<P>lieve I was a pretty big fool in those days."&nbsp; He



<P>spoke as after a lapse of years.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a little pause.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"All th' officers say we've got th' rebs in



<P>a pretty tight box," said the friend, clearing



<P>his throat in a commonplace way.&nbsp; "They all



<P>seem t' think we've got 'em jest where we



<P>want 'em."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I don't know about that," the youth replied.



<P>"What I seen over on th' right makes me think



<P>it was th' other way about.&nbsp; From where I was,



<P>it looked as if we was gettin' a good poundin'



<P>yestirday."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"D'yeh think so?" inquired the friend.&nbsp; "I



<P>thought we handled 'em pretty rough yestir-



<P>day."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Not a bit," said the youth.&nbsp; "Why, lord,



<P>man, you didn't see nothing of the fight.&nbsp; Why!"



<P>Then a sudden thought came to him.&nbsp; "Oh!



<P>Jim Conklin's dead."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His friend started.&nbsp; "What?&nbsp; Is he?&nbsp; Jim



<P>Conklin?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth spoke slowly.&nbsp; "Yes.&nbsp; He's dead.



<P>Shot in th' side."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yeh don't say so.&nbsp; Jim Conklin. . . . poor



<P>cuss!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>All about them were other small fires sur-



<P>rounded by men with their little black utensils.



<P>From one of these near came sudden sharp



<P>voices in a row.&nbsp; It appeared that two light-



<P>footed soldiers had been teasing a huge, bearded



<P>man, causing him to spill coffee upon his blue



<P>knees.&nbsp; The man had gone into a rage and had



<P>sworn comprehensively.&nbsp; Stung by his language,



<P>his tormentors had immediately bristled at him



<P>with a great show of resenting unjust oaths.



<P>Possibly there was going to be a fight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The friend arose and went over to them, mak-



<P>ing pacific motions with his arms.&nbsp; "Oh, here,



<P>now, boys, what's th' use?" he said.&nbsp; "We'll



<P>be at th' rebs in less'n an hour.&nbsp; What's th'



<P>good fightin' 'mong ourselves?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One of the light-footed soldiers turned upon



<P>him red-faced and violent.&nbsp; "Yeh needn't come



<P>around here with yer preachin'.&nbsp; I s'pose yeh



<P>don't approve 'a fightin' since Charley Morgan



<P>licked yeh; but I don't see what business this



<P>here is 'a yours or anybody else."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, it ain't," said the friend mildly.&nbsp; "Still



<P>I hate t' see--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was a tangled argument.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, he--," said the two, indicating their



<P>opponent with accusative forefingers.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The huge soldier was quite purple with rage.



<P>He pointed at the two soldiers with his great



<P>hand, extended clawlike.&nbsp; "Well, they--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But during this argumentative time the de-



<P>sire to deal blows seemed to pass, although they



<P>said much to each other.&nbsp; Finally the friend re-



<P>turned to his old seat.&nbsp; In a short while the



<P>three antagonists could be seen together in an



<P>amiable bunch.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Jimmie Rogers ses I'll have t' fight him



<P>after th' battle t'-day," announced the friend as



<P>he again seated himself.&nbsp; "He ses he don't



<P>allow no interferin' in his business.&nbsp; I hate t' see



<P>th' boys fightin' 'mong themselves."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth laughed.&nbsp; "Yer changed a good



<P>bit.&nbsp; Yeh ain't at all like yeh was.&nbsp; I remember



<P>when you an' that Irish feller--"&nbsp; He stopped



<P>and laughed again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I didn't use t' be that way," said his



<P>friend thoughtfully.&nbsp; "That's true 'nough."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I didn't mean--" began the youth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The friend made another deprecatory gesture.



<P>"Oh, yeh needn't mind, Henry."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was another little pause.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Th' reg'ment lost over half th' men yestir-



<P>day," remarked the friend eventually.&nbsp; "I thought



<P>a course they was all dead, but, laws, they kep'



<P>a-comin' back last night until it seems, after all,



<P>we didn't lose but a few.&nbsp; They'd been scattered



<P>all over, wanderin' around in th' woods, fightin'



<P>with other reg'ments, an' everything.&nbsp; Jest like



<P>you done."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So?" said the youth.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A SPUTTERING of musketry was always to be



<P>heard.&nbsp; Later, the cannon had entered the dis-



<P>pute.&nbsp; In the fog-filled air their voices made a



<P>thudding sound.&nbsp; The reverberations were con-



<P>tinued.&nbsp; This part of the world led a strange,



<P>battleful existence.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth's regiment was marched to relieve



<P>a command that had lain long in some damp



<P>trenches.&nbsp; The men took positions behind a curv-



<P>ing line of rifle pits that had been turned up, like



<P>a large furrow, along the line of woods.&nbsp; Before



<P>them was a level stretch, peopled with short,



<P>deformed stumps.&nbsp; From the woods beyond



<P>came the dull popping of the skirmishers and



<P>pickets, firing in the fog.&nbsp; From the right came



<P>the noise of a terrific fracas.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The men cuddled behind the small embank-



<P>ment and sat in easy attitudes awaiting their



<P>turn.&nbsp; Many had their backs to the firing.&nbsp; The



<P>youth's friend lay down, buried his face in his

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>154



<P>arms, and almost instantly, it seemed, he was in a



<P>deep sleep.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth leaned his breast against the



<P>brown dirt and peered over at the woods and up



<P>and down the line.&nbsp; Curtains of trees interfered



<P>with his ways of vision.&nbsp; He could see the low



<P>line of trenches but for a short distance.&nbsp; A few



<P>idle flags were perched on the dirt hills.&nbsp; Behind



<P>them were rows of dark bodies with a few heads



<P>sticking curiously over the top.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Always the noise of skirmishers came from



<P>the woods on the front and left, and the din on



<P>the right had grown to frightful proportions.



<P>The guns were roaring without an instant's pause



<P>for breath.&nbsp; It seemed that the cannon had come



<P>from all parts and were engaged in a stupendous



<P>wrangle.&nbsp; It became impossible to make a sen-



<P>tence heard.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth wished to launch a joke--a quota-



<P>tion from newspapers.&nbsp; He desired to say, "All



<P>quiet on the Rappahannock," but the guns refused



<P>to permit even a comment upon their uproar.



<P>He never successfully concluded the sentence.



<P>But at last the guns stopped, and among the



<P>men in the rifle pits rumors again flew, like birds,



<P>but they were now for the most part black



<P>creatures who flapped their wings drearily near



<P>to the ground and refused to rise on any wings of



<P>hope.&nbsp; The men's faces grew doleful from the



<P>interpreting of omens.&nbsp; Tales of hesitation and



<P>uncertainty on the part of those high in place and



<P>responsibility came to their ears.&nbsp; Stories of



<P>disaster were borne into their minds with many



<P>proofs.&nbsp; This din of musketry on the right, grow-



<P>ing like a released genie of sound, expressed and



<P>emphasized the army's plight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The men were disheartened and began to



<P>mutter.&nbsp; They made gestures expressive of the



<P>sentence: "Ah, what more can we do?"&nbsp; And it



<P>could always be seen that they were bewildered



<P>by the alleged news and could not fully compre-



<P>hend a defeat.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Before the gray mists had been totally ob-



<P>literated by the sun rays, the regiment was march-



<P>ing in a spread column that was retiring carefully



<P>through the woods.&nbsp; The disordered, hurrying



<P>lines of the enemy could sometimes be seen down



<P>through the groves and little fields.&nbsp; They were



<P>yelling, shrill and exultant.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At this sight the youth forgot many personal



<P>matters and became greatly enraged.&nbsp; He ex-



<P>ploded in loud sentences.&nbsp; "B'jiminey, we're



<P>generaled by a lot 'a lunkheads."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"More than one feller has said that t'-day,"



<P>observed a man.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His friend, recently aroused, was still very



<P>drowsy.&nbsp; He looked behind him until his mind



<P>took in the meaning of the movement.&nbsp; Then he



<P>sighed.&nbsp; "Oh, well, I s'pose we got licked," he



<P>remarked sadly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth had a thought that it would not be



<P>handsome for him to freely condemn other men.



<P>He made an attempt to restrain himself, but the



<P>words upon his tongue were too bitter.&nbsp; He



<P>presently began a long and intricate denunciation



<P>of the commander of the forces.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Mebbe, it wa'n't all his fault--not all to-



<P>gether.&nbsp; He did th' best he knowed.&nbsp; It's our



<P>luck t' git licked often," said his friend in a weary



<P>tone.&nbsp; He was trudging along with stooped



<P>shoulders and shifting eyes like a man who has



<P>been caned and kicked.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, don't we fight like the devil?&nbsp; Don't



<P>we do all that men can?" demanded the youth



<P>loudly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was secretly dumfounded at this sentiment



<P>when it came from his lips.&nbsp; For a moment his



<P>face lost its valor and he looked guiltily about



<P>him.&nbsp; But no one questioned his right to deal in



<P>such words, and presently he recovered his air



<P>of courage.&nbsp; He went on to repeat a statement



<P>he had heard going from group to group at the



<P>camp that morning.&nbsp; "The brigadier said he



<P>never saw a new reg'ment fight the way we



<P>fought yestirday, didn't he?&nbsp; And we didn't do



<P>better than many another reg'ment, did we?



<P>Well, then, you can't say it's th' army's fault, can



<P>you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In his reply, the friend's voice was stern.&nbsp; "'A



<P>course not," he said.&nbsp; "No man dare say we



<P>don't fight like th' devil.&nbsp; No man will ever dare



<P>say it.&nbsp; Th' boys fight like hell-roosters.&nbsp; But



<P>still--still, we don't have no luck."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, then, if we fight like the devil an'



<P>don't ever whip, it must be the general's fault,"



<P>said the youth grandly and decisively.&nbsp; "And I



<P>don't see any sense in fighting and fighting and



<P>fighting, yet always losing through some derned



<P>old lunkhead of a general."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A sarcastic man who was tramping at the



<P>youth's side, then spoke lazily.&nbsp; "Mebbe yeh



<P>think yeh fit th' hull battle yestirday, Fleming,"



<P>he remarked.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The speech pierced the youth.&nbsp; Inwardly he



<P>was reduced to an abject pulp by these chance



<P>words.&nbsp; His legs quaked privately.&nbsp; He cast a



<P>frightened glance at the sarcastic man.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, no," he hastened to say in a concili-



<P>ating voice, "I don't think I fought the whole



<P>battle yesterday."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But the other seemed innocent of any deeper



<P>meaning.&nbsp; Apparently, he had no information.



<P>It was merely his habit.&nbsp; "Oh!" he replied in the



<P>same tone of calm derision.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth, nevertheless, felt a threat.&nbsp; His



<P>mind shrank from going near to the danger, and



<P>thereafter he was silent.&nbsp; The significance of the



<P>sarcastic man's words took from him all loud



<P>moods that would make him appear prominent.



<P>He became suddenly a modest person.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was low-toned talk among the troops.



<P>The officers were impatient and snappy, their



<P>countenances clouded with the tales of misfor-



<P>tune.&nbsp; The troops, sifting through the forest,



<P>were sullen.&nbsp; In the youth's company once a



<P>man's laugh rang out.&nbsp; A dozen soldiers turned



<P>their faces quickly toward him and frowned with



<P>vague displeasure.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The noise of firing dogged their footsteps.



<P>Sometimes, it seemed to be driven a little way,



<P>but it always returned again with increased



<P>insolence.&nbsp; The men muttered and cursed,



<P>throwing black looks in its direction.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In a clear space the troops were at last halted.



<P>Regiments and brigades, broken and detached



<P>through their encounters with thickets, grew



<P>together again and lines were faced toward the



<P>pursuing bark of the enemy's infantry.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This noise, following like the yellings of eager,



<P>metallic hounds, increased to a loud and joyous



<P>burst, and then, as the sun went serenely up the



<P>sky, throwing illuminating rays into the gloomy



<P>thickets, it broke forth into prolonged pealings.



<P>The woods began to crackle as if afire.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Whoop-a-dadee," said a man, "here we are!



<P>Everybody fightin'.&nbsp; Blood an' destruction."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I was willin' t' bet they'd attack as soon as



<P>th' sun got fairly up," savagely asserted the



<P>lieutenant who commanded the youth's company.



<P>He jerked without mercy at his little mustache.



<P>He strode to and fro with dark dignity in the



<P>rear of his men, who were lying down behind



<P>whatever protection they had collected.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A battery had trundled into position in the



<P>rear and was thoughtfully shelling the distance.



<P>The regiment, unmolested as yet, awaited the



<P>moment when the gray shadows of the woods



<P>before them should be slashed by the lines of



<P>flame.&nbsp; There was much growling and swearing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Good Gawd," the youth grumbled, "we're



<P>always being chased around like rats!&nbsp; It makes



<P>me sick.&nbsp; Nobody seems to know where we go



<P>or why we go.&nbsp; We just get fired around from



<P>pillar to post and get licked here and get licked



<P>there, and nobody knows what it's done for.&nbsp; It



<P>makes a man feel like a damn' kitten in a bag.



<P>Now, I'd like to know what the eternal thunders



<P>we was marched into these woods for anyhow,

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE 161

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>unless it was to give the rebs a regular pot shot



<P>at us.&nbsp; We came in here and got our legs all



<P>tangled up in these cussed briers, and then we



<P>begin to fight and the rebs had an easy time of it.



<P>Don't tell me it's just luck!&nbsp; I know better.&nbsp; It's



<P>this derned old--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The friend seemed jaded, but he interrupted



<P>his comrade with a voice of calm confidence.



<P>"It'll turn out all right in th' end," he said.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, the devil it will!&nbsp; You always talk like a



<P>dog-hanged parson.&nbsp; Don't tell me!&nbsp; I know--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At this time there was an interposition by the



<P>savage-minded lieutenant, who was obliged to



<P>vent some of his inward dissatisfaction upon his



<P>men.&nbsp; "You boys shut right up!&nbsp; There no



<P>need 'a your wastin' your breath in long-winded



<P>arguments about this an' that an' th' other.



<P>You've been jawin' like a lot 'a old hens.&nbsp; All



<P>you've got t' do is to fight, an' you'll get plenty 'a



<P>that t' do in about ten minutes.&nbsp; Less talkin' an'



<P>more fightin' is what's best for you boys.&nbsp; I never



<P>saw sech gabbling jackasses."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He paused, ready to pounce upon any man



<P>who might have the temerity to reply.&nbsp; No words



<P>being said, he resumed his dignified pacing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"There's too much chin music an' too little



<P>fightin' in this war, anyhow," he said to them,



<P>turning his head for a final remark.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The day had grown more white, until the sun



<P>shed his full radiance upon the thronged forest.



<P>A sort of a gust of battle came sweeping toward



<P>that part of the line where lay the youth's regi-



<P>ment.&nbsp; The front shifted a trifle to meet it square-



<P>ly.&nbsp; There was a wait.&nbsp; In this part of the field



<P>there passed slowly the intense moments that pre-



<P>cede the tempest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A single rifle flashed in a thicket before the



<P>regiment.&nbsp; In an instant it was joined by many



<P>others.&nbsp; There was a mighty song of clashes and



<P>crashes that went sweeping through the woods.



<P>The guns in the rear, aroused and enraged by



<P>shells that had been thrown burlike at them,



<P>suddenly involved themselves in a hideous alter-



<P>cation with another band of guns.&nbsp; The battle



<P>roar settled to a rolling thunder, which was a



<P>single, long explosion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the regiment there was a peculiar kind of



<P>hesitation denoted in the attitudes of the men.



<P>They were worn, exhausted, having slept but lit-



<P>tle and labored much.&nbsp; They rolled their eyes



<P>toward the advancing battle as they stood await-



<P>ing the shock.&nbsp; Some shrank and flinched.&nbsp; They



<P>stood as men tied to stakes.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>THE next morning the youth discovered that



<P>his tall comrade had been the fast-flying messen-



<P>ger of a mistake.&nbsp; There was much scoffing at



<P>the latter by those who had yesterday been firm



<P>adherents of his views, and there was even a lit-



<P>tle sneering by men who had never believed the



<P>rumor.&nbsp; The tall one fought with a man from



<P>Chatfield Corners and beat him severely.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth felt, however, that his problem was



<P>in no wise lifted from him.&nbsp; There was, on the



<P>contrary, an irritating prolongation.&nbsp; The tale



<P>had created in him a great concern for himself.



<P>Now, with the newborn question in his mind, he



<P>was compelled to sink back into his old place as



<P>part of a blue demonstration.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>For days he made ceaseless calculations, but



<P>they were all wondrously unsatisfactory.&nbsp; He



<P>found that he could establish nothing.&nbsp; He final-



<P>ly concluded that the only way to prove himself



<P>was to go into the blaze, and then figuratively to

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>18



<P>watch his legs to discover their merits and faults.



<P>He reluctantly admitted that he could not sit



<P>still and with a mental slate and pencil derive an



<P>answer.&nbsp; To gain it, he must have blaze, blood,



<P>and danger, even as a chemist requires this, that,



<P>and the other.&nbsp; So he fretted for an opportunity.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Meanwhile he continually tried to measure



<P>himself by his comrades.&nbsp; The tall soldier, for



<P>one, gave him some assurance.&nbsp; This man's se-



<P>rene unconcern dealt him a measure of con-



<P>fidence, for he had known him since childhood,



<P>and from his intimate knowledge he did not see



<P>how he could be capable of anything that was



<P>beyond him, the youth.&nbsp; Still, he thought that



<P>his comrade might be mistaken about himself.



<P>Or, on the other hand, he might be a man here-



<P>tofore doomed to peace and obscurity, but, in



<P>reality, made to shine in war.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth would have liked to have discov-



<P>ered another who suspected himself.&nbsp; A sympa-



<P>thetic comparison of mental notes would have



<P>been a joy to him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He occasionally tried to fathom a comrade



<P>with seductive sentences.&nbsp; He looked about to



<P>find men in the proper mood.&nbsp; All attempts



<P>failed to bring forth any statement which looked



<P>in any way like a confession to those doubts



<P>which he privately acknowledged in himself.



<P>He was afraid to make an open declaration of



<P>his concern, because he dreaded to place some



<P>unscrupulous confidant upon the high plane of



<P>the unconfessed from which elevation he could



<P>be derided.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In regard to his companions his mind wa-



<P>vered between two opinions, according to his



<P>mood.&nbsp; Sometimes he inclined to believing them



<P>all heroes.&nbsp; In fact, he usually admitted in secret



<P>the superior development of the higher qualities



<P>in others.&nbsp; He could conceive of men going very



<P>insignificantly about the world bearing a load of



<P>courage unseen, and although he had known



<P>many of his comrades through boyhood, he be-



<P>gan to fear that his judgment of them had been



<P>blind.&nbsp; Then, in other moments, he flouted these



<P>theories, and assured himself that his fellows



<P>were all privately wondering and quaking.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His emotions made him feel strange in the



<P>presence of men who talked excitedly of a pro-



<P>spective battle as of a drama they were about to



<P>witness, with nothing but eagerness and curiosity



<P>apparent in their faces.&nbsp; It was often that he sus-



<P>pected them to be liars.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He did not pass such thoughts without severe



<P>condemnation of himself.&nbsp; He dinned reproaches



<P>at times.&nbsp; He was convicted by himself of many



<P>shameful crimes against the gods of traditions.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In his great anxiety his heart was continually



<P>clamoring at what he considered the intolerable



<P>slowness of the generals.&nbsp; They seemed content



<P>to perch tranquilly on the river bank, and leave



<P>him bowed down by the weight of a great prob-



<P>lem.&nbsp; He wanted it settled forthwith.&nbsp; He could



<P>not long bear such a load, he said.&nbsp; Sometimes



<P>his anger at the commanders reached an acute



<P>stage, and he grumbled about the camp like a



<P>veteran.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One morning, however, he found himself in



<P>the ranks of his prepared regiment.&nbsp; The men



<P>were whispering speculations and recounting the



<P>old rumors.&nbsp; In the gloom before the break of



<P>the day their uniforms glowed a deep purple



<P>hue.&nbsp; From across the river the red eyes were



<P>still peering.&nbsp; In the eastern sky there was a yel-



<P>low patch like a rug laid for the feet of the com-



<P>ing sun; and against it, black and patternlike,



<P>loomed the gigantic figure of the colonel on a



<P>gigantic horse.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>From off in the darkness came the trampling



<P>of feet.&nbsp; The youth could occasionally see dark



<P>shadows that moved like monsters.&nbsp; The regi-



<P>ment stood at rest for what seemed a long time.



<P>The youth grew impatient.&nbsp; It was unendurable



<P>the way these affairs were managed.&nbsp; He won-



<P>dered how long they were to be kept waiting.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As he looked all about him and pondered



<P>upon the mystic gloom, he began to believe that



<P>at any moment the ominous distance might be



<P>aflare, and the rolling crashes of an engagement



<P>come to his ears.&nbsp; Staring once at the red eyes



<P>across the river, he conceived them to be grow-



<P>ing larger, as the orbs of a row of dragons ad-



<P>vancing.&nbsp; He turned toward the colonel and saw



<P>him lift his gigantic arm and calmly stroke his



<P>mustache.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At last he heard from along the road at the



<P>foot of the hill the clatter of a horse's galloping



<P>hoofs.&nbsp; It must be the coming of orders.&nbsp; He



<P>bent forward, scarce breathing.&nbsp; The exciting



<P>clickety-click, as it grew louder and louder,



<P>seemed to be beating upon his soul.&nbsp; Presently a



<P>horseman with jangling equipment drew rein be-



<P>fore the colonel of the regiment.&nbsp; The two held



<P>a short, sharp-worded conversation.&nbsp; The men in



<P>the foremost ranks craned their necks.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As the horseman wheeled his animal and gal-



<P>loped away he turned to shout over his shoulder,



<P>"Don't forget that box of cigars!"&nbsp; The colonel



<P>mumbled in reply.&nbsp; The youth wondered what a



<P>box of cigars had to do with war.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A moment later the regiment went swinging



<P>off into the darkness.&nbsp; It was now like one of



<P>those moving monsters wending with many feet.



<P>The air was heavy, and cold with dew.&nbsp; A mass



<P>of wet grass, marched upon, rustled like silk.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was an occasional flash and glimmer



<P>of steel from the backs of all these huge crawl-



<P>ing reptiles.&nbsp; From the road came creakings and



<P>grumblings as some surly guns were dragged



<P>away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The men stumbled along still muttering specu-



<P>lations.&nbsp; There was a subdued debate.&nbsp; Once a



<P>man fell down, and as he reached for his rifle a



<P>comrade, unseeing, trod upon his hand.&nbsp; He of



<P>the injured fingers swore bitterly and aloud.&nbsp; A



<P>low, tittering laugh went among his fellows.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Presently they passed into a roadway and



<P>marched forward with easy strides.&nbsp; A dark



<P>regiment moved before them, and from behind



<P>also came the tinkle of equipments on the bodies



<P>of marching men.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The rushing yellow of the developing day



<P>went on behind their backs.&nbsp; When the sunrays



<P>at last struck full and mellowingly upon the



<P>earth, the youth saw that the landscape was



<P>streaked with two long, thin, black columns



<P>which disappeared on the brow of a hill in front



<P>and rearward vanished in a wood.&nbsp; They were



<P>like two serpents crawling from the cavern of the



<P>night.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The river was not in view.&nbsp; The tall soldier



<P>burst into praises of what he thought to be his



<P>powers of perception.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Some of the tall one's companions cried with



<P>emphasis that they, too, had evolved the same



<P>thing, and they congratulated themselves upon



<P>it.&nbsp; But there were others who said that the tall



<P>one's plan was not the true one at all.&nbsp; They per-



<P>sisted with other theories.&nbsp; There was a vigorous



<P>discussion.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth took no part in them.&nbsp; As he



<P>walked along in careless line he was engaged



<P>with his own eternal debate.&nbsp; He could not hin-



<P>der himself from dwelling upon it.&nbsp; He was de-



<P>spondent and sullen, and threw shifting glances



<P>about him.&nbsp; He looked ahead, often expecting to



<P>hear from the advance the rattle of firing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But the long serpents crawled slowly from



<P>hill to hill without bluster of smoke.&nbsp; A dun-col-



<P>ored cloud of dust floated away to the right.



<P>The sky overhead was of a fairy blue.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth studied the faces of his compan-



<P>ions, ever on the watch to detect kindred emo-



<P>tions.&nbsp; He suffered disappointment.&nbsp; Some ardor



<P>of the air which was causing the veteran com-



<P>mands to move with glee--almost with song--



<P>had infected the new regiment.&nbsp; The men began



<P>to speak of victory as of a thing they knew.



<P>Also, the tall soldier received his vindication.



<P>They were certainly going to come around in



<P>behind the enemy.&nbsp; They expressed commisera-



<P>tion for that part of the army which had been



<P>left upon the river bank, felicitating themselves



<P>upon being a part of a blasting host.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth, considering himself as separated



<P>from the others, was saddened by the blithe and



<P>merry speeches that went from rank to rank.



<P>The company wags all made their best endeav-



<P>ors.&nbsp; The regiment tramped to the tune of



<P>laughter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The blatant soldier often convulsed whole



<P>files by his biting sarcasms aimed at the tall one.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And it was not long before all the men seemed



<P>to forget their mission.&nbsp; Whole brigades grinned



<P>in unison, and regiments laughed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A rather fat soldier attempted to pilfer a horse



<P>from a dooryard.&nbsp; He planned to load his knap-



<P>sack upon it.&nbsp; He was escaping with his prize



<P>when a young girl rushed from the house and



<P>grabbed the animal's mane.&nbsp; There followed a



<P>wrangle.&nbsp; The young girl, with pink cheeks and



<P>shining eyes, stood like a dauntless statue.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The observant regiment, standing at rest in



<P>the roadway, whooped at once, and entered



<P>whole-souled upon the side of the maiden.&nbsp; The



<P>men became so engrossed in this affair that they



<P>entirely ceased to remember their own large war.



<P>They jeered the piratical private, and called



<P>attention to various defects in his personal ap-



<P>pearance; and they were wildly enthusiastic in



<P>support of the young girl.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To her, from some distance, came bold advice.



<P>"Hit him with a stick."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There were crows and catcalls showered



<P>upon him when he retreated without the horse.



<P>The regiment rejoiced at his downfall.&nbsp; Loud



<P>and vociferous congratulations were showered



<P>upon the maiden, who stood panting and regard-



<P>ing the troops with defiance.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>At nightfall the column broke into regimental



<P>pieces, and the fragments went into the fields to



<P>camp.&nbsp; Tents sprang up like strange plants.



<P>Camp fires, like red, peculiar blossoms, dotted



<P>the night.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth kept from intercourse with his



<P>companions as much as circumstances would



<P>allow him.&nbsp; In the evening he wandered a few



<P>paces into the gloom.&nbsp; From this little distance



<P>the many fires, with the black forms of men pass-



<P>ing to and fro before the crimson rays, made



<P>weird and satanic effects.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He lay down in the grass.&nbsp; The blades



<P>pressed tenderly against his cheek.&nbsp; The moon



<P>had been lighted and was hung in a treetop.



<P>The liquid stillness of the night enveloping him



<P>made him feel vast pity for himself.&nbsp; There was



<P>a caress in the soft winds; and the whole mood



<P>of the darkness, he thought, was one of sympathy



<P>for himself in his distress.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He wished, without reserve, that he was at



<P>home again making the endless rounds from the



<P>house to the barn, from the barn to the fields,



<P>from the fields to the barn, from the barn to the



<P>house.&nbsp; He remembered he had often cursed the



<P>brindle cow and her mates, and had sometimes



<P>flung milking stools.&nbsp; But, from his present point



<P>of view, there was a halo of happiness about each



<P>of their heads, and he would have sacrificed all



<P>the brass buttons on the continent to have been



<P>enabled to return to them.&nbsp; He told himself that



<P>he was not formed for a soldier.&nbsp; And he mused



<P>seriously upon the radical differences between



<P>himself and those men who were dodging imp-



<P>like around the fires.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As he mused thus he heard the rustle of grass,



<P>and, upon turning his head, discovered the loud



<P>soldier.&nbsp; He called out, "Oh, Wilson!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The latter approached and looked down.



<P>"Why, hello, Henry; is it you?&nbsp; What you do-



<P>ing here?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, thinking," said the youth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The other sat down and carefully lighted his



<P>pipe.&nbsp; "You're getting blue, my boy.&nbsp; You're



<P>looking thundering peeked.&nbsp; What the dickens



<P>is wrong with you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, nothing," said the youth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The loud soldier launched then into the sub-



<P>ject of the anticipated fight.&nbsp; "Oh, we've got



<P>'em now!"&nbsp; As he spoke his boyish face was



<P>wreathed in a gleeful smile, and his voice had



<P>an exultant ring.&nbsp; "We've got 'em now.&nbsp; At



<P>last, by the eternal thunders, we'll lick 'em



<P>good!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"If the truth was known," he added, more



<P>soberly, "THEY'VE licked US about every clip up to



<P>now; but this time--this time--we'll lick 'em



<P>good!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I thought you was objecting to this march



<P>a little while ago," said the youth coldly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, it wasn't that," explained the other.&nbsp; "I



<P>don't mind marching, if there's going to be fight-



<P>ing at the end of it.&nbsp; What I hate is this getting



<P>moved here and moved there, with no good com-



<P>ing of it, as far as I can see, excepting sore feet



<P>and damned short rations."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, Jim Conklin says we'll get a plenty of



<P>fighting this time."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"He's right for once, I guess, though I can't



<P>see how it come.&nbsp; This time we're in for a big



<P>battle, and we've got the best end of it, certain



<P>sure.&nbsp; Gee rod! how we will thump 'em!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He arose and began to pace to and fro excit-



<P>edly.&nbsp; The thrill of his enthusiasm made him



<P>walk with an elastic step.&nbsp; He was sprightly,



<P>vigorous, fiery in his belief in success.&nbsp; He



<P>looked into the future with clear, proud eye, and



<P>he swore with the air of an old soldier.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth watched him for a moment in



<P>silence.&nbsp; When he finally spoke his voice was as



<P>bitter as dregs.&nbsp; "Oh, you're going to do great



<P>things, I s'pose!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The loud soldier blew a thoughtful cloud of



<P>smoke from his pipe.&nbsp; "Oh, I don't know," he



<P>remarked with dignity; "I don't know.&nbsp; I s'pose



<P>I'll do as well as the rest.&nbsp; I'm going to try like



<P>thunder."&nbsp; He evidently complimented himself



<P>upon the modesty of this statement.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"How do you know you won't run when the



<P>time comes?" asked the youth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Run?" said the loud one; "run?--of course



<P>not!"&nbsp; He laughed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well," continued the youth, "lots of good-



<P>a-'nough men have thought they was going to do



<P>great things before the fight, but when the time



<P>come they skedaddled."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, that's all true, I s'pose," replied the



<P>other; "but I'm not going to skedaddle.&nbsp; The



<P>man that bets on my running will lose his money,



<P>that's all."&nbsp; He nodded confidently.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, shucks!" said the youth.&nbsp; "You ain't



<P>the bravest man in the world, are you?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No, I ain't," exclaimed the loud soldier in-



<P>dignantly; "and I didn't say I was the bravest



<P>man in the world, neither.&nbsp; I said I was going to



<P>do my share of fighting--that's what I said.&nbsp; And



<P>I am, too.&nbsp; Who are you, anyhow.&nbsp; You talk as



<P>if you thought you was Napoleon Bonaparte."



<P>He glared at the youth for a moment, and then



<P>strode away.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth called in a savage voice after his



<P>comrade: "Well, you needn't git mad about it!"



<P>But the other continued on his way and made no



<P>reply.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He felt alone in space when his injured com-



<P>rade had disappeared.&nbsp; His failure to discover



<P>any mite of resemblance in their view points



<P>made him more miserable than before.&nbsp; No one



<P>seemed to be wrestling with such a terrific per-



<P>sonal problem.&nbsp; He was a mental outcast.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He went slowly to his tent and stretched him-



<P>self on a blanket by the side of the snoring tall



<P>soldier.&nbsp; In the darkness he saw visions of a thou-



<P>sand-tongued fear that would babble at his back



<P>and cause him to flee, while others were going



<P>coolly about their country's business.&nbsp; He admit-



<P>ted that he would not be able to cope with this



<P>monster.&nbsp; He felt that every nerve in his body



<P>would be an ear to hear the voices, while other



<P>men would remain stolid and deaf.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>And as he sweated with the pain of these



<P>thoughts, he could hear low, serene sentences.



<P>"I'll bid five."&nbsp; "Make it six."&nbsp; "Seven."



<P>"Seven goes."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He stared at the red, shivering reflection of



<P>a fire on the white wall of his tent until, ex-



<P>hausted and ill from the monotony of his suf-



<P>fering, he fell asleep.

<P>

<HR WIDTH="100%">



<P>WHEN another night came the columns,



<P>changed to purple streaks, filed across two pon-



<P>toon bridges.&nbsp; A glaring fire wine-tinted the



<P>waters of the river.&nbsp; Its rays, shining upon the



<P>moving masses of troops, brought forth here and



<P>there sudden gleams of silver or gold.&nbsp; Upon



<P>the other shore a dark and mysterious range of



<P>hills was curved against the sky.&nbsp; The insect



<P>voices of the night sang solemnly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After this crossing the youth assured himself



<P>that at any moment they might be suddenly and



<P>fearfully assaulted from the caves of the lowering



<P>woods.&nbsp; He kept his eyes watchfully upon the



<P>darkness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But his regiment went unmolested to a camp-



<P>ing place, and its soldiers slept the brave sleep



<P>of wearied men.&nbsp; In the morning they were



<P>routed out with early energy, and hustled along



<P>a narrow road that led deep into the forest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>It was during this rapid march that the regiment

<BR>lost many of the marks of a new com-



<P>mand.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The men had begun to count the miles upon



<P>their fingers, and they grew tired.&nbsp; "Sore feet



<P>an' damned short rations, that's all," said the



<P>loud soldier.&nbsp; There was perspiration and grum-



<P>blings.&nbsp; After a time they began to shed their



<P>knapsacks.&nbsp; Some tossed them unconcernedly



<P>down; others hid them carefully, asserting their



<P>plans to return for them at some convenient



<P>time.&nbsp; Men extricated themselves from thick



<P>shirts.&nbsp; Presently few carried anything but their



<P>necessary clothing, blankets, haversacks, canteens,



<P>and arms and ammunition.&nbsp; "You can now eat



<P>and shoot," said the tall soldier to the youth.



<P>"That's all you want to do."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was sudden change from the ponderous



<P>infantry of theory to the light and speedy infantry



<P>of practice.&nbsp; The regiment, relieved of a burden,



<P>received a new impetus.&nbsp; But there was much



<P>loss of valuable knapsacks, and, on the whole,



<P>very good shirts.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But the regiment was not yet veteranlike in



<P>appearance.&nbsp; Veteran regiments in the army



<P>were likely to be very small aggregations of men.



<P>Once, when the command had first come to the



<P>field, some perambulating veterans, noting the



<P>length of their column, had accosted them thus:



<P>"Hey, fellers, what brigade is that?"&nbsp; And when



<P>the men had replied that they formed a regiment



<P>and not a brigade, the older soldiers had laughed,



<P>and said, "O Gawd!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Also, there was too great a similarity in the



<P>hats.&nbsp; The hats of a regiment should properly



<P>represent the history of headgear for a period of



<P>years.&nbsp; And, moreover, there were no letters of



<P>faded gold speaking from the colors.&nbsp; They were



<P>new and beautiful, and the color bearer habitu-



<P>ally oiled the pole.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Presently the army again sat down to think.



<P>The odor of the peaceful pines was in the men's



<P>nostrils.&nbsp; The sound of monotonous axe blows



<P>rang through the forest, and the insects, nodding



<P>upon their perches, crooned like old women.



<P>The youth returned to his theory of a blue dem-



<P>onstration.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>One gray dawn, however, he was kicked in



<P>the leg by the tall soldier, and then, before he



<P>was entirely awake, he found himself running



<P>down a wood road in the midst of men who were



<P>panting from the first effects of speed.&nbsp; His can-



<P>teen banged rhythmically upon his thigh, and his



<P>haversack bobbed softly.&nbsp; His musket bounced



<P>a trifle from his shoulder at each stride and made



<P>his cap feel uncertain upon his head.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He could hear the men whisper jerky sen-



<P>tences: "Say--what's all this--about?"&nbsp; "What



<P>th' thunder--we--skedaddlin' this way fer?"



<P>"Billie--keep off m' feet.&nbsp; Yeh run--like a cow."



<P>And the loud soldier's shrill voice could be



<P>heard: "What th' devil they in sich a hurry for?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth thought the damp fog of early



<P>morning moved from the rush of a great body



<P>of troops.&nbsp; From the distance came a sudden



<P>spatter of firing.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was bewildered.&nbsp; As he ran with his com-



<P>rades he strenuously tried to think, but all he knew



<P>was that if he fell down those coming behind



<P>would tread upon him.&nbsp; All his faculties seemed



<P>to be needed to guide him over and past obstruc-



<P>tions.&nbsp; He felt carried along by a mob.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The sun spread disclosing rays, and, one by



<P>one, regiments burst into view like armed men



<P>just born of the earth.&nbsp; The youth perceived



<P>that the time had come.&nbsp; He was about to be



<P>measured.&nbsp; For a moment he felt in the face of



<P>his great trial like a babe, and the flesh over



<P>his heart seemed very thin.&nbsp; He seized time to



<P>look about him calculatingly.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But he instantly saw that it would be impossi-



<P>ble for him to escape from the regiment.&nbsp; It in-



<P>closed him.&nbsp; And there were iron laws of tradi-



<P>tion and law on four sides.&nbsp; He was in a moving



<P>box.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As he perceived this fact it occurred to him



<P>that he had never wished to come to the war.



<P>He had not enlisted of his free will.&nbsp; He had



<P>been dragged by the merciless government.&nbsp; And



<P>now they were taking him out to be slaughtered.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The regiment slid down a bank and wallowed



<P>across a little stream.&nbsp; The mournful current



<P>moved slowly on, and from the water, shaded



<P>black, some white bubble eyes looked at the men.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As they climbed the hill on the farther side



<P>artillery began to boom.&nbsp; Here the youth forgot



<P>many things as he felt a sudden impulse of curi-



<P>osity.&nbsp; He scrambled up the bank with a speed



<P>that could not be exceeded by a bloodthirsty



<P>man.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He expected a battle scene.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There were some little fields girted and



<P>squeezed by a forest.&nbsp; Spread over the grass and



<P>in among the tree trunks, he could see knots and



<P>waving lines of skirmishers who were running



<P>hither and thither and firing at the landscape.



<P>A dark battle line lay upon a sunstruck clearing



<P>that gleamed orange color.&nbsp; A flag fluttered.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Other regiments floundered up the bank.&nbsp; The



<P>brigade was formed in line of battle, and after a



<P>pause started slowly through the woods in the



<P>rear of the receding skirmishers, who were con-



<P>tinually melting into the scene to appear again



<P>farther on.&nbsp; They were always busy as bees,



<P>deeply absorbed in their little combats.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth tried to observe everything.&nbsp; He



<P>did not use care to avoid trees and branches,



<P>and his forgotten feet were constantly knocking



<P>against stones or getting entangled in briers.



<P>He was aware that these battalions with their



<P>commotions were woven red and startling into



<P>the gentle fabric of softened greens and browns.



<P>It looked to be a wrong place for a battle field.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The skirmishers in advance fascinated him.



<P>Their shots into thickets and at distant and



<P>prominent trees spoke to him of tragedies--hid-



<P>den, mysterious, solemn.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Once the line encountered the body of a dead



<P>soldier.&nbsp; He lay upon his back staring at the sky.



<P>He was dressed in an awkward suit of yellowish



<P>brown.&nbsp; The youth could see that the soles of his



<P>shoes had been worn to the thinness of writing



<P>paper, and from a great rent in one the dead foot



<P>projected piteously.&nbsp; And it was as if fate had



<P>betrayed the soldier.&nbsp; In death it exposed to his



<P>enemies that poverty which in life he had perhaps



<P>concealed from his friends.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The ranks opened covertly to avoid the corpse.



<P>The invulnerable dead man forced a way for him-



<P>self.&nbsp; The youth looked keenly at the ashen face.



<P>The wind raised the tawny beard.&nbsp; It moved as



<P>if a hand were stroking it.&nbsp; He vaguely desired



<P>to walk around and around the body and stare;



<P>the impulse of the living to try to read in dead



<P>eyes the answer to the Question.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>During the march the ardor which the youth



<P>had acquired when out of view of the field rapidly



<P>faded to nothing.&nbsp; His curiosity was quite easily



<P>satisfied.&nbsp; If an intense scene had caught him with



<P>its wild swing as he came to the top of the bank,



<P>he might have gone roaring on.&nbsp; This advance



<P>upon Nature was too calm.&nbsp; He had opportunity



<P>to reflect.&nbsp; He had time in which to wonder



<P>about himself and to attempt to probe his sensa-



<P>tions.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Absurd ideas took hold upon him.&nbsp; He



<P>thought that he did not relish the landscape.



<P>It threatened him.&nbsp; A coldness swept over his



<P>back, and it is true that his trousers felt to him



<P>that they were no fit for his legs at all.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A house standing placidly in distant fields



<P>had to him an ominous look.&nbsp; The shadows of



<P>the woods were formidable.&nbsp; He was certain that



<P>in this vista there lurked fierce-eyed hosts.&nbsp; The



<P>swift thought came to him that the generals did



<P>not know what they were about.&nbsp; It was all a



<P>trap.&nbsp; Suddenly those close forests would bristle



<P>with rifle barrels.&nbsp; Ironlike brigades would ap-



<P>pear in the rear.&nbsp; They were all going to be



<P>sacrificed.&nbsp; The generals were stupids.&nbsp; The



<P>enemy would presently swallow the whole com-



<P>mand.&nbsp; He glared about him, expecting to see



<P>the stealthy approach of his death.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He thought that he must break from the ranks



<P>and harangue his comrades.&nbsp; They must not all



<P>be killed like pigs; and he was sure it would



<P>come to pass unless they were informed of these



<P>dangers.&nbsp; The generals were idiots to send them



<P>marching into a regular pen.&nbsp; There was but one



<P>pair of eyes in the corps.&nbsp; He would step forth



<P>and make a speech.&nbsp; Shrill and passionate words



<P>came to his lips.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The line, broken into moving fragments by the



<P>ground, went calmly on through fields and woods.



<P>The youth looked at the men nearest him, and



<P>saw, for the most part, expressions of deep inter-



<P>est, as if they were investigating something that



<P>had fascinated them.&nbsp; One or two stepped with



<P>overvaliant airs as if they were already plunged



<P>into war.&nbsp; Others walked as upon thin ice.&nbsp; The



<P>greater part of the untested men appeared quiet



<P>and absorbed.&nbsp; They were going to look at war,



<P>the red animal--war, the blood-swollen god.&nbsp; And



<P>they were deeply engrossed in this march.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>As he looked the youth gripped his outcry at



<P>his throat.&nbsp; He saw that even if the men were



<P>tottering with fear they would laugh at his warn-



<P>ing.&nbsp; They would jeer him, and, if practicable,



<P>pelt him with missiles.&nbsp; Admitting that he might



<P>be wrong, a frenzied declamation of the kind



<P>would turn him into a worm.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He assumed, then, the demeanor of one who



<P>knows that he is doomed alone to unwritten re-



<P>sponsibilities.&nbsp; He lagged, with tragic glances at



<P>the sky.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was surprised presently by the young lieu-



<P>tenant of his company, who began heartily to



<P>beat him with a sword, calling out in a loud and



<P>insolent voice: "Come, young man, get up into



<P>ranks there.&nbsp; No skulking'll do here."&nbsp; He mend-



<P>ed his pace with suitable haste.&nbsp; And he hated



<P>the lieutenant, who had no appreciation of fine



<P>minds.&nbsp; He was a mere brute.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>After a time the brigade was halted in the



<P>cathedral light of a forest.&nbsp; The busy skirmish-



<P>ers were still popping.&nbsp; Through the aisles of



<P>the wood could be seen the floating smoke from



<P>their rifles.&nbsp; Sometimes it went up in little balls,



<P>white and compact.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>During this halt many men in the regiment



<P>began erecting tiny hills in front of them.&nbsp; They



<P>used stones, sticks, earth, and anything they



<P>thought might turn a bullet.&nbsp; Some built com-



<P>paratively large ones, while others seemed con-



<P>tent with little ones.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This procedure caused a discussion among the



<P>men.&nbsp; Some wished to fight like duelists, believ-



<P>ing it to be correct to stand erect and be, from



<P>their feet to their foreheads, a mark.&nbsp; They said



<P>they scorned the devices of the cautious.&nbsp; But



<P>the others scoffed in reply, and pointed to the



<P>veterans on the flanks who were digging at the



<P>ground like terriers.&nbsp; In a short time there was



<P>quite a barricade along the regimental fronts.



<P>Directly, however, they were ordered to with-



<P>draw from that place.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>This astounded the youth.&nbsp; He forgot his



<P>stewing over the advance movement.&nbsp; "Well,



<P>then, what did they march us out here for?" he



<P>demanded of the tall soldier.&nbsp; The latter with



<P>calm faith began a heavy explanation, although



<P>he had been compelled to leave a little protection



<P>of stones and dirt to which he had devoted much



<P>care and skill.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the regiment was aligned in another



<P>position each man's regard for his safety caused



<P>another line of small intrenchments.&nbsp; They ate



<P>their noon meal behind a third one.&nbsp; They were



<P>moved from this one also.&nbsp; They were marched



<P>from place to place with apparent aimlessness.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth had been taught that a man be-



<P>came another thing in a battle.&nbsp; He saw his sal-



<P>vation in such a change.&nbsp; Hence this waiting



<P>was an ordeal to him.&nbsp; He was in a fever of im-



<P>patience.&nbsp; He considered that there was denoted



<P>a lack of purpose on the part of the generals.



<P>He began to complain to the tall soldier.&nbsp; "I



<P>can't stand this much longer," he cried.&nbsp; "I



<P>don't see what good it does to make us wear



<P>out our legs for nothin'."&nbsp; He wished to return



<P>to camp, knowing that this affair was a blue



<P>demonstration; or else to go into a battle and



<P>discover that he had been a fool in his doubts,



<P>and was, in truth, a man of traditional courage.



<P>The strain of present circumstances he felt to be



<P>intolerable.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The philosophical tall soldier measured a sand-



<P>wich of cracker and pork and swallowed it in a



<P>nonchalant manner.&nbsp; "Oh, I suppose we must go



<P>reconnoitering around the country jest to keep



<P>'em from getting too close, or to develop 'em, or



<P>something."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Huh!" said the loud soldier.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well," cried the youth, still fidgeting, "I'd



<P>rather do anything 'most than go tramping 'round



<P>the country all day doing no good to nobody and



<P>jest tiring ourselves out."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"So would I," said the loud soldier.&nbsp; "It ain't



<P>right.&nbsp; I tell you if anybody with any sense was



<P>a-runnin' this army it--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Oh, shut up!" roared the tall private.&nbsp; "You



<P>little fool.&nbsp; You little damn' cuss.&nbsp; You ain't had



<P>that there coat and them pants on for six months,



<P>and yet you talk as if--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Well, I wanta do some fighting anyway,"



<P>interrupted the other.&nbsp; "I didn't come here to



<P>walk.&nbsp; I could 'ave walked to home--'round an'



<P>'round the barn, if I jest wanted to walk."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The tall one, red-faced, swallowed another



<P>sandwich as if taking poison in despair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But gradually, as he chewed, his face became



<P>again quiet and contented.&nbsp; He could not rage



<P>in fierce argument in the presence of such sand-



<P>wiches.&nbsp; During his meals he always wore an air



<P>of blissful contemplation of the food he had swal-



<P>lowed.&nbsp; His spirit seemed then to be communing



<P>with the viands.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He accepted new environment and circum-



<P>stance with great coolness, eating from his haver-



<P>sack at every opportunity.&nbsp; On the march he



<P>went along with the stride of a hunter, object-



<P>ing to neither gait nor distance.&nbsp; And he had



<P>not raised his voice when he had been ordered



<P>away from three little protective piles of earth



<P>and stone, each of which had been an engineer-



<P>ing feat worthy of being made sacred to the name



<P>of his grandmother.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>In the afternoon the regiment went out over



<P>the same ground it had taken in the morn-



<P>ing.&nbsp; The landscape then ceased to threaten the



<P>youth.&nbsp; He had been close to it and become



<P>familiar with it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When, however, they began to pass into a



<P>new region, his old fears of stupidity and in-



<P>competence reassailed him, but this time he dog-



<P>gedly let them babble.&nbsp; He was occupied with



<P>his problem, and in his desperation he concluded



<P>that the stupidity did not greatly matter.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Once he thought he had concluded that it



<P>would be better to get killed directly and end



<P>his troubles.&nbsp; Regarding death thus out of the



<P>corner of his eye, he conceived it to be noth-



<P>ing but rest, and he was filled with a momen-



<P>tary astonishment that he should have made an



<P>extraordinary commotion over the mere matter



<P>of getting killed.&nbsp; He would die; he would go



<P>to some place where he would be understood.



<P>It was useless to expect appreciation of his pro-



<P>found and fine senses from such men as the lieu-



<P>tenant.&nbsp; He must look to the grave for compre-



<P>hension.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The skirmish fire increased to a long chatter-



<P>ing sound.&nbsp; With it was mingled far-away cheer-



<P>ing.&nbsp; A battery spoke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Directly the youth would see the skirmishers



<P>running.&nbsp; They were pursued by the sound of



<P>musketry fire.&nbsp; After a time the hot, dangerous



<P>flashes of the rifles were visible.&nbsp; Smoke clouds



<P>went slowly and insolently across the fields like



<P>observant phantoms.&nbsp; The din became crescendo,



<P>like the roar of an oncoming train.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>A brigade ahead of them and on the right



<P>went into action with a rending roar.&nbsp; It was



<P>as if it had exploded.&nbsp; And thereafter it lay



<P>stretched in the distance behind a long gray wall,



<P>that one was obliged to look twice at to make



<P>sure that it was smoke.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth, forgetting his neat plan of getting



<P>killed, gazed spell bound.&nbsp; His eyes grew wide



<P>and busy with the action of the scene.&nbsp; His



<P>mouth was a little ways open.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Of a sudden he felt a heavy and sad hand laid



<P>upon his shoulder.&nbsp; Awakening from his trance



<P>of observation he turned and beheld the loud



<P>soldier.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's my first and last battle, old boy," said



<P>the latter, with intense gloom.&nbsp; He was quite



<P>pale and his girlish lip was trembling.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Eh?" murmured the youth in great aston-



<P>ishment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"It's my first and last battle, old boy,"



<P>continued the loud soldier.&nbsp; "Something tells



<P>me--"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"What?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"I'm a gone coon this first time and--and I



<P>w-want you to take these here things--to--my--



<P>folks."&nbsp; He ended in a quavering sob of pity for



<P>himself.&nbsp; He handed the youth a little packet



<P>done up in a yellow envelope.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Why, what the devil--" began the youth



<P>again.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But the other gave him a glance as from the



<P>depths of a tomb, and raised his limp hand in a



<P>prophetic manner and turned away.

<HR WIDTH="100%">

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>THIS advance of the enemy had seemed to the



<P>youth like a ruthless hunting.&nbsp; He began to fume



<P>with rage and exasperation.&nbsp; He beat his foot



<P>upon the ground, and scowled with hate at the



<P>swirling smoke that was approaching like a phan-



<P>tom flood.&nbsp; There was a maddening quality in



<P>this seeming resolution of the foe to give him no



<P>rest, to give him no time to sit down and think.



<P>Yesterday he had fought and had fled rapidly.



<P>There had been many adventures.&nbsp; For to-day he



<P>felt that he had earned opportunities for contem-



<P>plative repose.&nbsp; He could have enjoyed portraying



<P>to uninitiated listeners various scenes at which he



<P>had been a witness or ably discussing the pro-



<P>cesses of war with other proved men.&nbsp; Too it was



<P>important that he should have time for physical



<P>recuperation.&nbsp; He was sore and stiff from his ex-



<P>periences.&nbsp; He had received his fill of all exer-



<P>tions, and he wished to rest.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>But those other men seemed never to grow



<P>weary; they were fighting with their old speed.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>163



<P>He had a wild hate for the relentless foe.&nbsp; Yester-



<P>day, when he had imagined the universe to be



<P>against him, he had hated it, little gods and big



<P>gods; to-day he hated the army of the foe with



<P>the same great hatred.&nbsp; He was not going to be



<P>badgered of his life, like a kitten chased by boys,



<P>he said.&nbsp; It was not well to drive men into final



<P>corners; at those moments they could all develop



<P>teeth and claws.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He leaned and spoke into his friend's ear.&nbsp; He



<P>menaced the woods with a gesture.&nbsp; "If they



<P>keep on chasing us, by Gawd, they'd better watch



<P>out.&nbsp; Can't stand TOO much."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The friend twisted his head and made a calm



<P>reply.&nbsp; "If they keep on a-chasin' us they'll drive



<P>us all inteh th' river."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth cried out savagely at this state-



<P>ment.&nbsp; He crouched behind a little tree, with his



<P>eyes burning hatefully and his teeth set in a cur-



<P>like snarl.&nbsp; The awkward bandage was still about



<P>his head, and upon it, over his wound, there was



<P>a spot of dry blood.&nbsp; His hair was wondrously



<P>tousled, and some straggling, moving locks hung



<P>over the cloth of the bandage down toward his



<P>forehead.&nbsp; His jacket and shirt were open at the



<P>throat, and exposed his young bronzed neck.



<P>There could be seen spasmodic gulpings at his



<P>throat.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>His fingers twined nervously about his rifle.



<P>He wished that it was an engine of annihilating



<P>power.&nbsp; He felt that he and his companions were



<P>being taunted and derided from sincere convic-



<P>tions that they were poor and puny.&nbsp; His knowl-



<P>edge of his inability to take vengeance for it made



<P>his rage into a dark and stormy specter, that pos-



<P>sessed him and made him dream of abominable



<P>cruelties.&nbsp; The tormentors were flies sucking in-



<P>solently at his blood, and he thought that he would



<P>have given his life for a revenge of seeing their



<P>faces in pitiful plights.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The winds of battle had swept all about the



<P>regiment, until the one rifle, instantly followed by



<P>others, flashed in its front.&nbsp; A moment later the



<P>regiment roared forth its sudden and valiant re-



<P>tort.&nbsp; A dense wall of smoke settled slowly down.



<P>It was furiously slit and slashed by the knifelike



<P>fire from the rifles.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>To the youth the fighters resembled animals



<P>tossed for a death struggle into a dark pit.&nbsp; There



<P>was a sensation that he and his fellows, at bay,



<P>were pushing back, always pushing fierce on-



<P>slaughts of creatures who were slippery.&nbsp; Their



<P>beams of crimson seemed to get no purchase upon



<P>the bodies of their foes; the latter seemed to evade



<P>them with ease, and come through, between,



<P>around, and about with unopposed skill.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When, in a dream, it occurred to the youth



<P>that his rifle was an impotent stick, he lost sense



<P>of everything but his hate, his desire to smash



<P>into pulp the glittering smile of victory which he



<P>could feel upon the faces of his enemies.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The blue smoke-swallowed line curled and



<P>writhed like a snake stepped upon.&nbsp; It swung its



<P>ends to and fro in an agony of fear and rage.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The youth was not conscious that he was erect



<P>upon his feet.&nbsp; He did not know the direction of



<P>the ground.&nbsp; Indeed, once he even lost the habit



<P>of balance and fell heavily.&nbsp; He was up again



<P>immediately.&nbsp; One thought went through the



<P>chaos of his brain at the time.&nbsp; He wondered if



<P>he had fallen because he had been shot.&nbsp; But the



<P>suspicion flew away at once.&nbsp; He did not think



<P>more of it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He had taken up a first position behind the lit-



<P>tle tree, with a direct determination to hold it



<P>against the world.&nbsp; He had not deemed it possi-



<P>ble that his army could that day succeed, and



<P>from this he felt the ability to fight harder.&nbsp; But



<P>the throng had surged in all ways, until he lost



<P>directions and locations, save that he knew where



<P>lay the enemy.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The flames bit him, and the hot smoke broiled



<P>his skin.&nbsp; His rifle barrel grew so hot that ordi-



<P>narily he could not have borne it upon his palms;



<P>but he kept on stuffing cartridges into it, and



<P>pounding them with his clanking, bending ram-



<P>rod.&nbsp; If he aimed at some changing form through



<P>the smoke, he pulled his trigger with a fierce



<P>grunt, as if he were dealing a blow of the fist with



<P>all his strength.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When the enemy seemed falling back before



<P>him and his fellows, he went instantly forward,



<P>like a dog who, seeing his foes lagging, turns and



<P>insists upon being pursued.&nbsp; And when he was



<P>compelled to retire again, he did it slowly, sul-



<P>lenly, taking steps of wrathful despair.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Once he, in his intent hate, was almost alone,



<P>and was firing, when all those near him had ceased.



<P>He was so engrossed in his occupation that he



<P>was not aware of a lull.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He was recalled by a hoarse laugh and a sen-



<P>tence that came to his ears in a voice of contempt



<P>and amazement.&nbsp; "Yeh infernal fool, don't yeh



<P>know enough t' quit when there ain't anything t'



<P>shoot at?&nbsp; Good Gawd!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He turned then and, pausing with his rifle



<P>thrown half into position, looked at the blue line



<P>of his comrades.&nbsp; During this moment of leisure



<P>they seemed all to be engaged in staring with



<P>astonishment at him.&nbsp; They had become specta-



<P>tors.&nbsp; Turning to the front again he saw, under



<P>the lifted smoke, a deserted ground.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He looked bewildered for a moment.&nbsp; Then



<P>there appeared upon the glazed vacancy of his



<P>eyes a diamond point of intelligence.&nbsp; "Oh," he



<P>said, comprehending.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He returned to his comrades and threw him-



<P>self upon the ground.&nbsp; He sprawled like a man



<P>who had been thrashed.&nbsp; His flesh seemed strange-



<P>ly on fire, and the sounds of the battle continued



<P>in his ears.&nbsp; He groped blindly for his canteen.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The lieutenant was crowing.&nbsp; He seemed



<P>drunk with fighting.&nbsp; He called out to the youth:



<P>"By heavens, if I had ten thousand wild cats like



<P>you I could tear th' stomach outa this war in



<P>less'n a week!"&nbsp; He puffed out his chest with



<P>large dignity as he said it.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>Some of the men muttered and looked at the



<P>youth in awe-struck ways.&nbsp; It was plain that as



<P>he had gone on loading and firing and cursing



<P>without the proper intermission, they had found



<P>time to regard him.&nbsp; And they now looked upon



<P>him as a war devil.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The friend came staggering to him.&nbsp; There



<P>was some fright and dismay in his voice.&nbsp; "Are yeh



<P>all right, Fleming?&nbsp; Do yeh feel all right?&nbsp; There



<P>ain't nothin' th' matter with yeh, Henry, is there?"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"No," said the youth with difficulty.&nbsp; His



<P>throat seemed full of knobs and burs.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>These incidents made the youth ponder.&nbsp; It



<P>was revealed to him that he had been a barbarian,



<P>a beast.&nbsp; He had fought like a pagan who de-



<P>fends his religion.&nbsp; Regarding it, he saw that it



<P>was fine, wild, and, in some ways, easy.&nbsp; He had



<P>been a tremendous figure, no doubt.&nbsp; By this



<P>struggle he had overcome obstacles which he



<P>had admitted to be mountains.&nbsp; They had fallen



<P>like paper peaks, and he was now what he called



<P>a hero.&nbsp; And he had not been aware of the pro-



<P>cess.&nbsp; He had slept and, awakening, found him-



<P>self a knight.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>He lay and basked in the occasional stares of



<P>his comrades.&nbsp; Their faces were varied in de-



<P>grees of blackness from the burned powder.



<P>Some were utterly smudged.&nbsp; They were reek-



<P>ing with perspiration, and their breaths came



<P>hard and wheezing.&nbsp; And from these soiled ex-



<P>panses they peered at him.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Hot work!&nbsp; Hot work!" cried the lieu-



<P>tenant deliriously.&nbsp; He walked up and down,



<P>restless and eager.&nbsp; Sometimes his voice could



<P>be heard in a wild, incomprehensible laugh.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>When he had a particularly profound thought



<P>upon the science of war he always unconsciously



<P>addressed himself to the youth.

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>There was some grim rejoicing by the men.



<P>"By thunder, I bet this army'll never see another



<P>new reg'ment like us!"



<P>"You bet!"

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>&nbsp; "A dog, a woman, an' a walnut tree,



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Th' more yeh beat 'em, th' better they be!

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>That's like us."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Lost a piler men, they did.&nbsp; If an' ol' woman



<P>swep' up th' woods she'd git a dustpanful."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>"Yes, an' if she'll come around ag'in in 'bout



<P>an' hour she'll git a pile more."

<BR>&nbsp;

<BR>&nbsp;



<P>The forest still bore its burden of clamor.



<P>From off under the trees came the rolling clatter



<P>of the musketry.&nbsp; Each distant thicket seemed a



<P>strange porcupine with quills of flame.&nbsp; A cloud



<P>of dark smoke, as from smoldering ruins, went



<P>up toward the sun now bright and gay in the



<P>blue, enameled sky.
